# Forewor {#1.html#x-ck12-Rm9yZXdvcg..-chapter}

The study of life is one of the fundamental fields of the middle school
curriculum. The CK-12 Life Science Concept Collection presents life
science as a set of 12 chapters, each centered around a general area of
study, such as cell biology or human biology. Each chapter is broken
down into concepts. Each concept is a mini-lesson that addresses one
specific topic or key objective. The complete CK-12 Life Science Concept
Collection is comprised of 272 concepts.

**What does it mean to be alive?**

Scientifically, there is an actual definition of living. Living
organisms must have certain characteristics. If they do not have these
characteristics, are they living? This butterfly, like all other
insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common
characteristics with all life. What exactly does it mean to be alive?
This chapter will answer this question. These concepts will serve as an
introduction to life science, discussing the basics of studying the life
sciences and addressing the question, "What is a living organism?"

**What was that noise?**

If you let your emotions rule your thinking, you might think a thumping
noise was a ghost. If you think like a scientist, however, you ask
questions and make observations. You'd observe the shutters are loose
and blowing in the wind.

### Scientific Ways of Thinking {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW50aWZpYyBXYXlzIG9mIFRoaW5raW5n-g0w}

Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based on
observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. That means
scientists explain the world based on their own observations. If they
develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up a way to
test these new ideas.  

#### Thinking Like a Scientist {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhpbmtpbmcgTGlrZSBhIFNjaWVudGlzdA..-ruz}

A scientist is always trying to find the truth and discover new truths.
How can you think like a scientist? Thinking like a scientist is based
on asking and answering questions. Though you may not know it, you do
this all day long. Scientists ask questions, and then make detailed
observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a
**hypothesis** . They may design and perform an **experiment** to try to
answer their question and test their hypothesis. From the results of
their experiment, scientists draw **conclusions** . A conclusion
describes what the evidence tells the scientist. 

-   **Scientists ask questions** : The key to being a great scientist is
    to ask questions. Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo.
    While in the field, you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on
    the north side of the jungle. On the other side of the jungle, you
    find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying. What
    questions might you ask? A good scientist might ask the following
    two questions:
-   1.  "What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees
        live?"
    2.  "Are there differences in behavior between the two groups of
        chimpanzees?"

<!-- -->

-   **Scientists make detailed observations** : To **observe** means to
    watch and study attentively. A person untrained in the sciences may
    only observe, "The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying, while
    chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy." A scientist,
    however, will make more detailed observations. Can you think of ways
    to make this observation more detailed? What about the number of
    chimps? Are they male or female? Young or old? What do they eat? A
    good scientist may observe, "While all seven adult females and three
    adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show
    normal behavior, four female and five male chimps under the age of
    five on the south side have died." Detailed observations can
    ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer
    their questions. From these observations, a scientist will develop a
    hypothesis to explain the observations. A hypothesis is the
    scientist's proposed explanation for his observations. The
    scientist's hypothesis may be that "Young chimps on the south side
    die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet."

-   **Scientists find answers using tests** : When scientists want to
    answer a question, they search for evidence using experiments. An
    experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong.
    **Evidence** is made up of the observations a scientist makes during
    an experiment. To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees,
    scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts,
    berries, and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food.
    This test is the experiment. If fewer chimps die, then the
    experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having
    enough food. This is the evidence.
-   **Scientists question the answers** : Good scientists are skeptical.
    Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form
    a conclusion. For example, the chimpanzees in the experiment may
    have died from a lack of food, but can you think of another
    explanation for their death? They may have died from a virus, or
    from another less obvious cause. More experiments need to be
    completed before scientists can be sure. Science is about finding
    the truth, no matter what. So good scientists constantly question
    their own conclusions. They also find other scientists to confirm or
    disagree with their evidence.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-5j0}

-   Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based
    on observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing.
-   To think like a scientist, you must ask questions, make detailed
    observations, develop a hypothesis, find answers using tests, and
    question your answers.

**What kind of scientist studies dolphins?**

Dolphins are living organisms, so studying them is part of the life
sciences. The life sciences, however, are broken down into many fields.
Scientists that study dolphins and other life in the ocean are called
marine biologists.

### Fields in the Life Sciences {#2.html#x-ck12-RmllbGRzIGluIHRoZSBMaWZlIFNjaWVuY2Vz_1-qxi}

The **life sciences** are the study of living organisms. They deal with
every aspect of living organisms, from the biology of **cells** , to the
biology of individual organisms, to how these organisms interact with
other organisms and their environment.

The life sciences are so complex that most scientists focus on just one
or two subspecialties. If you want to study insects, what would you be
called? An entomologist. If you want to study the tiny things that give
us the flu, then you need to enter the field of **virology** , the study
of viruses. If you want to study the nervous system, which life science
field is right for you ( **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6c3Vic3BlY2lhbHR5X3N0dWRpZXM.) , **Table**

)?

  **Field**                **Focus**
  ------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Botany**               Plants
  **Zoology**              Animals

  **Freshwater biology**   Organisms living in and around freshwater lakes, streams, rivers, ponds, etc.
  **Microbiology**         Microorganisms
  **Bacteriology**         Bacteria
  **Virology**             Viruses
  **Entomology**           Insects
  **Taxonomy**             The classification of organisms

  ------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Cell biology**                           Cells and their structures/functions
  **Anatomy**                                Structures of animals
  **Morphology**                             Form and structure of living organisms
  **Physiology**                             Physical and chemical functions of tissues and organs

  **Field**                **Focus**
  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Ecology**              How various organisms interact with their environments
  **Biogeography**         Distribution of living organisms
  **Population biology**   The biodiversity, evolution, and environmental biology of populations of organisms

During the study of the life sciences, you will study **cell biology** ,
**genetics** , **molecular biology** , **botany** , **microbiology** ,
**zoology** , **evolution** , **ecology** , and **physiology** . Cell
biology is the study of cellular structure and function ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0wMi1yZWQtYmxvb2QtY2VsbHMtYW5kLXZpcnVzZXM.)
). Genetics is the study of **heredity** , which is the passing of
traits (and **genes** ) from one generation to the next. Molecular
biology is the study of molecules, such as DNA and proteins. Ecologists
study **ecosystems** , which are made of both living and nonliving parts
of the environment. A botanist may work in a botanical garden, where
plant life can be studied. What will you study with the other
subspecialties?

**What causes disease?**

Today most people realize that microorganisms, such as bacteria or
viruses, are the cause of disease. This concept is known as the germ
theory of disease, one of the few scientific theories in the field of
the life sciences. Although it seems obvious now, people did not always
understand the cause of disease. How does a theory such as this become
established?

### Scientific Evidence and Theories {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW50aWZpYyBFdmlkZW5jZSBhbmQgVGhlb3JpZXM._2-u53}

One goal of a scientist is to find answers to scientific questions. To
do this, scientists first develop a **hypothesis** , which is a proposed
explanation that tries to explain an observation. To collect
**evidence** to support (or disprove) their hypothesis, scientists must
do **experiments.** Evidence is:

1.  A direct, physical observation of something or a process over time.
2.  Usually something measurable or "quantifiable."
3.  The data resulting from an experiment.

For example, an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of
the law of gravity. A bear skeleton in the woods would be evidence of
the presence of bears.

Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this
evidence seems to defy the law of gravity ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZ3Jhdml0eQ..) ). Of course water cannot
be poured out of bottle and flow upward. The law of gravity is a
**scientific law** , which is a statement describing what always happens
under certain conditions in nature. Scientific laws are developed from
lots of collected information.

**Figure 2.4**

Water going upward against gravity.

</div>

If many experiments are performed, and lots of evidence is collected in
support of a general hypothesis, a scientific theory can be developed.
**Scientific theories** are well established explanations of evidence,
usually tested and confirmed by many different people. Scientific
theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory, and no
evidence disproving the theory. Scientific theories produce information
that helps us understand our world. For example, the idea that matter is
made up of atoms is a scientific theory. Scientists accept this theory
as a fundamental principle of basic science.

A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing. Thus, when
scientists find new evidence, they can change their theories. In
addition to the germ theory of disease, other scientific theories are
the cell theory and the theory of evolution.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-rke}

-   Evidence is a direct, physical observation of something or
    a process.
-   Scientific theories are explanations of some aspect of the natural

**How do scientists obtain new knowledge?**

All the information in textbooks had to come from somewhere. In the
sciences, new information about the natural world is a result of
scientific investigations. These investigations are shaped by the
scientific method.

### Scientific Method {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW50aWZpYyBNZXRob2Q._3-7he}

The **scientific method** is a process used to investigate the unknown (
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QklPLTAxLTAyLVNjaWVudGlmaWMtSW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbg..)
). It is the general process of a **scientific investigation** . This
process uses evidence and testing. Scientists use the scientific method
so they can find information. A common method allows all scientists to
answer questions in a similar way. Scientists who use this method can
reproduce another scientist's experiments.

Almost all versions of the scientific method include the following
steps, although some scientists do use slight variations.

1.  Make observations.
2.  Identify a question you would like to answer based on
    the observation.
3.  Find out what is already known about your observation (research).
4.  Form a hypothesis.
5.  Test the hypothesis.
6.  Analyze your results and draw conclusions.
7.  Communicate your results.

Steps of a Scientific Investigation. A scientific investigation
typically has these steps.

</div>

#### Making Observations {#2.html#x-ck12-TWFraW5nIE9ic2VydmF0aW9ucw.._3-ytl}

Imagine that you are a scientist. While collecting water samples at a
local pond, you notice a frog with five legs instead of four (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0wOC1mcm9nLWV4dHJhLWxlZw..)
). As you start to look around, you discover that many of the frogs have
extra limbs, extra eyes, or no eyes. One frog even has limbs coming out
of its mouth. These are your **observations** , or things you notice
about an environment using your five senses.

#### Identify a Question Based on Your Observations {#2.html#x-ck12-SWRlbnRpZnkgYSBRdWVzdGlvbiBCYXNlZCBvbiBZb3VyIE9ic2VydmF0aW9ucw.._3-0lr}

The next step is to ask a question about the frogs. You may ask, "Why
are so many frogs deformed?" Or, "Is there something in their
environment causing these defects, like water pollution?" Yet, you do
not know if this large number of deformities is "normal" for frogs. What
if many of the frogs found in ponds and lakes all over the world have
similar deformities? Before you look for causes, you need to find out if
the number and kind of deformities is unusual. So besides finding out
*why* the frogs are deformed, you should also ask: "Is the percentage of
deformed frogs in this pond greater than the percentage of deformed
frogs in other places?"

#### Research Existing Knowledge About the Topic {#2.html#x-ck12-UmVzZWFyY2ggRXhpc3RpbmcgS25vd2xlZGdlIEFib3V0IHRoZSBUb3BpYw.._3-srw}

No matter what you observe, you need to find out what is already known
about your questions. For example, is anyone else doing research on
deformed frogs? If yes, what did they find out? Do you think that you
should repeat their research to see if it can be duplicated? During your
research, you might learn something that convinces you to change or
refine your question. From this, you will construct your hypothesis.

#### Construct a Hypothesis {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29uc3RydWN0IGEgSHlwb3RoZXNpcw.._3-9yr}

A **hypothesis** is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an
observation. A good hypothesis allows you to make more predictions. For
example, you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is
running into the pond and causing frogs to have extra legs. If that's
true, then you can predict that the water in a pond of non-deformed
frogs will have lower levels of that pesticide. That's a prediction you
can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds, those with
deformed frogs and those with nothing but healthy frogs. Every
hypothesis needs to be written in a way that it can:

1.  Be tested using experiments to collect evidence.
2.  Be proven wrong.
3.  Provide measurable results.
4.  Provide yes or no answers.

For example, do you think the following hypothesis meets the four
criteria above? Let's see. Hypothesis: "The number of deformed frogs in
five ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number
of deformed frogs in five ponds without chemical X." Of course, next you
will have to test your hypothesis.

#### Test Your Hypothesis {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVzdCBZb3VyIEh5cG90aGVzaXM._3-0rv}

To test the hypothesis, an **experiment** will be done. You would count
the healthy and deformed frogs and measure the amount of chemical X in
all of the ponds. The hypothesis will be either true or false. Doing an
experiment will test most hypotheses. The experiment may generate
evidence in support of the hypothesis. The experiment may also generate
evidence proving the hypothesis false. Once you collect your data, it
will need to be analyzed.

#### Analyze Data and Draw a Conclusion {#2.html#x-ck12-QW5hbHl6ZSBEYXRhIGFuZCBEcmF3IGEgQ29uY2x1c2lvbg.._3-xf6}

If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the experiment will
produce results that you can measure, collect, and analyze. The analysis
should tell you if the hypothesis is true or false. Refer to the table
for the experimental results ( **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZGVmb3JtZWQtZnJvZy1kYXRh) ).

  **Polluted Pond**   **Number of Deformed Frogs**   **Non-Polluted Pond**   **Number of Deformed Frogs**
  ------------------- ------------------------------ ----------------------- ------------------------------
  1                   20                             1                       23
  2                   23                             2                       25
  3                   25                             3                       30
  4                   26                             4                       16
  5                   21                             5                       20
  Average:            23                             Average:                22.8

Your results show that pesticide levels in the two sets of ponds are
different, but the average number of deformed frogs is almost the same.
Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false. The situation
may be more complicated than you thought. This gives you new information
that will help you decide what to do next. Even if the results supported
your hypothesis, you would probably ask a new question to try to better
understand what is happening to the frogs and why.

#### Drawing Conclusions and Communicating Results {#2.html#x-ck12-RHJhd2luZyBDb25jbHVzaW9ucyBhbmQgQ29tbXVuaWNhdGluZyBSZXN1bHRz_3-c4r}

If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed, the results will
indicate whether your hypothesis is true or false. If a hypothesis is
true, scientists will often continue testing the hypothesis in new ways
to learn more. If a hypothesis is false, the results may be used to come
up with and test a new hypothesis. A scientist will then communicate the
results to the scientific community. This will allow others to review
the information and extend the studies. The scientific community can
also use the information for related studies. Scientists communicate
their results in a number of ways. For example, they may talk to small
groups of scientists and give talks at large scientific meetings. They
will also write articles for scientific journals. Their findings may
also be communicated to journalists.

If you conclude that frogs are deformed due to a pesticide not
previously measured, you would publish an article and give talks about
your research. Your conclusion could eventually help find solutions to
this problem.

**Why should we study the rainforest?**

Some scientists study problems that seem to have very little impact on
our lives. For example, scientists are working to describe every type of
plant and animal in the rainforest. What is the purpose? Many of our
medicines come from plants and animals of the rainforest. So what
medicines have not yet been discovered? There might be new cures to
diseases yet to be identified. This is an example of how science can be
applied to our lives.

### Basic and Applied Science {#2.html#x-ck12-QmFzaWMgYW5kIEFwcGxpZWQgU2NpZW5jZQ.._4-h5z}

Science can be "basic" or "applied." The goal of **basic science** is to
understand how things work—whether it is a single **cell** , an organism
made of trillions of cells, or a whole **ecosystem** . Scientists
working on basic science questions are simply looking to increase human
knowledge of nature and the world around us. The knowledge obtained
through the study of the subspecialties of the life sciences is mostly
basic science. 

Basic science is the source of most **scientific theories** . For
example, a scientist that tries to figure out how the body makes
cholesterol, or what causes a particular disease, is performing basic
science. This is also known as **basic research** . Additional examples
of basic research would be investigating how glucose is turned into
cellular energy or determining how elevated blood glucose levels can be
harmful. The study of the cell (cell biology), the study of inheritance
(genetics), the study of molecules (molecular biology), the study of
microorganisms and viruses (microbiology and virology), the study of
tissues and organs (physiology) are all types of basic research, and
have all generated lots of information that is applied to humans and
human health.

**Applied science** is using scientific discoveries, such as those from
basic research, to solve practical problems. For example, medicine, and
all that is known about how to treat patients, is applied science based
on basic research ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0xMC1zdXJnZW9ucw..) ). A doctor
administering a drug to lower a person's cholesterol is an example of
applied science. Applied science also creates new technologies based on
basic science. For example, designing windmills to capture wind energy
is applied science ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfd2luZG1pbGw.) ). This technology relies,
however, on basic science. Studies of wind patterns and bird migration
routes help determine the best placement for the windmills.

**How can we see the details of bacteria?**

With the naked eye, bacteria just look like a slimy smear on a petri
dish. How can we study them in more detail? The invention of the
microscope has allowed us to see bacteria, cells, and other things too
small to be seen with the naked eye.

### The Microscope {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1pY3Jvc2NvcGU._5-ywm}

Microscopes, tools that you may get to use in your class, are some of
the most important tools in biology ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0xMS1saWdodC1taWNyb3Njb3Bl) ). A
**microscope** is a tool used to make things that are too small to be
seen by the human eye look bigger. **Microscopy** is the study of small
objects using microscopes. Look at your fingertips. Before microscopes
were invented in 1595, the smallest things you could see on yourself
were the tiny lines in your skin. But what else is hidden in your skin?

#### Invention of the Microscope {#2.html#x-ck12-SW52ZW50aW9uIG9mIHRoZSBNaWNyb3Njb3Bl_5-qs5}

Over four hundred years ago, two Dutch spectacle makers, Zaccharias
Janssen and his son Hans, were experimenting with several lenses in a
tube. They discovered that nearby objects appeared greatly enlarged, or
**magnified** . This was the forerunner of the compound microscope and
of the telescope.

In 1665, Robert Hooke, an English natural scientist, used a microscope
to zoom in on a piece of cork - the stuff that makes up the stoppers in
wine bottles, which is made from tree bark. Inside of cork, he
discovered tiny structures,  which he called **cells.** It turns out
that cells are the smallest structural unit of living organisms. This
finding eventually led to the development of the theory that *all living
things are made of cells.* Without microscopes, this discovery would not
have been possible, and the **cell theor** y would not have been
developed.

Hooke's discovery of the cell set the stage for other scientists to
discover other types of organisms. After Hooke, the "father of
microscopy," Dutch scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0xMi1MZWV1d2VuaG9law..) ) taught
himself to make one of the first microscopes. In one of his early
experiments, van Leeuwenhoek took a sample of scum from his own teeth
and used his microscope to discover **bacteria** , the smallest living
organism on the planet. Using microscopes, van Leeuwenhoek also
discovered one-celled **protists** and sperm cells.

Today, microscopes are used by all types of scientists, including cell
biologists, microbiologists, virologists, forensic scientists,
entomologists, taxonomists, and many other types.

Some modern microscopes use light, as Hooke's and van Leeuwenhoek's did.
Others may use electron beams or sound waves. Researchers now use these
four types of microscopes:

1.  **Light microscopes** allow biologists to see small details of
    a specimen. Most of the microscopes used in schools and laboratories
    are light microscopes. Light microscopes use lenses, typically made
    of glass or plastic, to focus light either into the eye, a camera,
    or some other light detector. The most powerful light microscopes
    can make images up to 2,000 times larger.
2.  **Transmission electron microscopes (TEM)** focus a beam of
    electrons through an object and can make an image up to two million
    times bigger, with a very clear image.
3.  **Scanning electron microscopes (SEM)** allow scientists to find the
    shape and surface texture of extremely small objects, including a
    paperclip, a bedbug, or even an atom. These microscopes slide a beam
    of electrons across the surface of a specimen, producing detailed
    maps of the surface of objects. Magnification in a SEM can be
    controlled over a range from about 10 to 500,000 times.
4.  **Scanning acoustic microscopes** use sound waves to scan
    a specimen. These microscopes are useful in biology and
    medical research.

**What does this sign mean?**

If a substance is corrosive, it can eat through objects. Many scientists
have to work with chemicals that are corrosive or otherwise dangerous.
That's one reason that following safety precautions in the laboratory or
field is very important.

### Safety in the Life Sciences {#2.html#x-ck12-U2FmZXR5IGluIHRoZSBMaWZlIFNjaWVuY2Vz_6-ekw}

There can be some very serious safety risks in scientific research. If
researchers are not careful, they could poison themselves or contract a
deadly illness. The kinds of risks that scientists face depend on the
kind of research they perform. For example, a scientist working with
bacteria in a laboratory faces different risks than a scientist studying
the behavior of lions in Africa, but both scientists must still follow
safety guidelines. Safety practices must be followed when working with
the hazardous things such as parasites, radiation and radioactive
materials, toxins, and wild animals. Also, **carcinogens** , which are
chemical that cause cancer, **pathogens** , which are disease-causing
virus, bacteria or fungi, and **teratogens** , which are chemical that
cause deformities in developing embryos, are extremely hazardous, and
extreme care must be used when working with these items as well. For
example, scientists studying dangerous organisms such as *Yersinia
pestis* , the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps
keep the organism from escaping the lab.

A **biohazard** is any biological material that could make someone sick,
including disease-causing organisms. Therefore, a used needle is a
biohazard because it could harbor blood contaminated with a
disease-causing organism. Bacteria grown in a laboratory are also
biohazards if they could potentially cause disease.

#### Laboratory Safety {#2.html#x-ck12-TGFib3JhdG9yeSBTYWZldHk._6-png}

If you perform an experiment in your classroom, your teacher will
explain how to be safe. Professional scientists follow safety rules as
well, especially for the study of dangerous organisms like the bacteria
that cause bubonic plague ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0yNC1wbGFndWUtc2FmZXR5) ).

Sharp objects, chemicals, heat, and electricity are all used at times in
laboratories. Below is a list of safety guidelines that you should
follow when in the laboratory:

-   Be sure to obey all safety guidelines given in lab instructions and
    by your teacher.
-   Follow directions carefully.
-   Tie back long hair.
-   Wear closed toe shoes with flat heels and shirts with no hanging
    sleeves, hoods, or drawstrings.
-   Use gloves, goggles, or safety aprons when instructed to do so.
-   Broken glass should only be cleaned up with a dust pan and broom.
    Never touch broken glass with your bare hands.
-   Never eat or drink anything in the science lab. Table tops and
    counters could have dangerous substances on them.
-   Be sure to completely clean materials like test tubes and beakers.
    Leftover substances could interact with other substances in
    future experiments.
-   If you are using flames or heat plates, be careful when you reach.
    Be sure your arms and hair are kept far away from heat.
-   Alert your teacher immediately if anything out of the
    ordinary occurs. An accident report may be required if someone
    is hurt. Also, the teacher must know if any materials are damaged
    or discarded.

#### Field Research Safety {#2.html#x-ck12-RmllbGQgUmVzZWFyY2ggU2FmZXR5_6-qns}

A **field scientist** studies an organism in a natural setting, which is
not usually an indoor laboratory. Scientists who work outdoors are also
required to follow safety regulations. These safety regulations are
designed to prevent harm to themselves, other humans, animals, and the
environment. If scientists work outside the country, they are required
to learn about and follow the laws and restrictions of the country in
which they are doing research. For example, entomologists following
monarch butterfly ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMS0yNS1tb25hcmNoLWJ1dHRlcmZseQ..) )
migrations between the United States and Mexico must follow regulations
in both countries. Before biologists can study protected wildlife or
plant species, they must apply for permission to do so, usually from the
government. This is important to protect these fragile species. For
example, if scientists collect rare butterflies, they must first get a
permit. They must also be careful to not disturb the habitat.

**Is fire alive?**

Fire can grow. Fire needs fuel and oxygen. But fire is not a form of
life, although it shares a few traits with some living things. How can
you distinguish between non-living and living things?

### The Characteristics of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENoYXJhY3RlcmlzdGljcyBvZiBMaWZl_7-w13}

How do you define a living thing? What do mushrooms, daisies, cats, and
bacteria have in common? All of these are living things, or
**organisms** . It might seem hard to think of similarities among such
different organisms, but they actually have many properties in common.
Living organisms are similar to each other because all organisms evolved
from the same common ancestor that lived billions of years ago.

All living organisms:

1.  Need energy to carry out life processes.
2.  Are composed of one or more cells.
3.  Respond to their environment.
4.  Grow and reproduce.
5.  Maintain a stable internal environment.

#### Living Things Need Resources and Energy {#2.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIFRoaW5ncyBOZWVkIFJlc291cmNlcyBhbmQgRW5lcmd5_7-5od}

Why do you eat everyday? To get energy. **Energy** is the ability to do
work. Without energy, you could not do any "work." Though not doing any
"work" may sound nice, the "work" fueled by energy includes everyday
activities, such as walking, writing, and thinking. But you are not the
only one who needs energy. In order to grow and reproduce and carry out
the other process of life, all living organisms need energy. But where
does this energy come from?

The source of energy differs for each type of living thing. In your
body, the source of energy is the food you eat. Here is how animals,
plants, and fungi obtain their energy:

-   All animals must eat in order to obtain energy. Animals also eat to
    obtain building materials. Animals eat plants and other animals.
-   Plants don’t eat. Instead, they use energy from the sun to make
    their "food" through the process of **photosynthesis** .
-   Mushrooms and other fungi obtain energy from other organisms. That’s
    why you often see fungi growing on a fallen tree; the rotting tree
    is their source of energy ( **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wMS1mdW5naS1saWNoZW4tbG9n) ).

Since plants harvest energy from the sun and other organisms get their
energy from plants, nearly all the energy of living things initially
comes from the sun.

#### Living Things Are Made of Cells {#2.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIFRoaW5ncyBBcmUgTWFkZSBvZiBDZWxscw.._7-nm1}

If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your
hand, or a drop of blood, you will find cells, you will find cells (
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wMi1yZXB0aWxpYW4tYmxvb2QtY2VsbA..) ).
**Cells** are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living
organisms. Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only
through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live
in the ocean, or the *Paramecium,* shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wMy1wYXJhbWVjaXVt) , are unicellular,
made of just one cell. Other organisms have millions, billions, or
trillions of cells.

All cells have at least some structures in common, such as
**ribosomes,** which are the sites where proteins are made. All cells
also have **DNA** and **proteins** . The **nucleus** is clearly visible
in the blood cells ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wMi1yZXB0aWxpYW4tYmxvb2QtY2VsbA..) ).
The nucleus can be described as the "information center," containing the
instructions (DNA) for making all the proteins in a cell, as well as how
much of each protein to make. The nucleus is also the main
distinguishing feature between the two general categories of cell, with
cells known as prokaryotic lacking a nucleus.

Although the cells of different organisms are built differently, they
all have certain general functions. Every cell must get energy from
food, be able to grow and divide, and respond to its environment. More
about cell structure and function will be discussed in additional
concepts.

#### Living Organisms Respond to their Environment {#2.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIE9yZ2FuaXNtcyBSZXNwb25kIHRvIHRoZWlyIEVudmlyb25tZW50_7-def}

All living organisms are able to react to something important or
interesting in their external environment. For example, living organisms
constantly respond to their environment. They respond to changes in
light, heat, sound, and chemical and mechanical contact. Organisms have
means for receiving information, such as eyes, ears, taste buds, or
other structures.

#### Living Things Grow and Reproduce {#2.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIFRoaW5ncyBHcm93IGFuZCBSZXByb2R1Y2U._7-zaa}

All living things **reproduce** to make the next generation. Organisms
that do not reproduce will go extinct. As a result, there are no species
that do not reproduce ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wNC1jYXRz) ). Some organisms reproduce
asexually ( **asexual reproduction** ), especially single-celled
organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves. Other
organisms reproduce sexually ( **sexual reproduction** ), combining
genetic information from two parents to make genetically unique
offspring.

#### Living Things Maintain Stable Internal Conditions {#2.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIFRoaW5ncyBNYWludGFpbiBTdGFibGUgSW50ZXJuYWwgQ29uZGl0aW9ucw.._7-lru}

When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to
warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat.
When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help
it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability
to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the
body or cells of organisms is known as **homeostasis** . Like us, many
animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature.
A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal
temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfY29sZGJpcmQ.) ).

**What's happening in this beaker?**

The bubbles indicate that vapor is being formed, which lets you know
that a chemical reaction is taking place. Many chemical reactions are
going on constantly inside your body. In fact, there are probably
thousands of chemical reactions occurring every second in every one of
your cells. And as all living things are comprised of chemicals,
understanding how chemicals work is essential to understanding how
living things work.

### Chemicals of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWxzIG9mIExpZmU._8-fbu}

#### The Elements {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVsZW1lbnRz_8-kcg}

If you pull a flower petal from a plant and break it in half, and then
take that piece and break it in half again, and take the next piece and
break it half, and so on, and so on, until you cannot even see the
flower anymore, what do you think you will find? We know that the flower
petal is made of **cells** , but what are cells made of? Scientists have
broken down **matter** , or anything that takes up space and has
mass—like a cell—into the smallest pieces that cannot be broken down
anymore. Every physical object, including rocks, animals, flowers, and
your body, are all made up of matter.

Matter is made up of a mixture of things called elements. **Elements**
are substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. There
are more than 100 known elements, and 92 occur naturally around us. The
others have been made only in the laboratory.

Inside of elements, you will find identical atoms. An **atom** is the
simplest and smallest particle of matter that still has chemical
properties of the element. Atoms are the building block of all of the
elements that make up the matter in your body or any other living or
non-living thing. Atoms are so small that only the most powerful
microscopes can see them.

Atoms themselves are composed of even smaller particles, including
positively charged **protons** , uncharged **neutrons** , and negatively
charged **electrons** . Protons and neutrons are located in the center
of the atom, or the nucleus, and the electrons move around the nucleus.
How many protons an atom has determines what element it is. For example,
hydrogen (H) has just one proton, helium (He) always has two protons (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wNy1IZWxpdW0tYXRvbQ..) ),
while sodium (Na) always has 11.

All the atoms of a particular element have the exact same number of
protons, and the number of protons is that element's **atomic number** .
An atom usually has the same number of protons and electrons, but
sometimes an atom may gain or lose an electron, giving the atom a
positive or negative charge. These atoms are known as **ions** and are

#### The Periodic Table {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBlcmlvZGljIFRhYmxl_8-tmi}

In 1869, a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev created the
**periodic table** , which is a way of organizing elements according to
their unique characteristics, like atomic number, density, boiling
point, and other values ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0wOC1wZXJpb2RpYy10YWJsZQ..) ). Each
element is represented by a one or two letter symbol. For example, H
stands for hydrogen, and Au stands for gold. The vertical columns in the
periodic table are known as groups, and elements in groups tend to have
very similar properties. The table is also divided into rows, known as
periods.

The periodic table groups the elements based on their properties. The
table begins with Hydrogen, atomic number 1.

</div>

#### Chemical Reactions {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25z_8-dc2}

A **molecule** is any combination of two or more atoms. The oxygen in
the air we breathe is two oxygen atoms connected by a chemical bond to
form O ~2~ , or molecular oxygen. A carbon dioxide molecule is a
combination of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, CO ~2~ . Because
carbon dioxide includes two different elements, it is a compound as well
as a molecule.

A **compound** is any combination of two or more different elements. A
compound has different properties from the elements that it contains.
Elements and combinations of elements (compounds) make up all the many
types of matter in the Universe. A **chemical reaction** is a process
that breaks or forms the bonds between atoms of molecules and compounds.
For example, two hydrogens and one oxygen bind together to form water, H
~2~ O. The molecules that come together to start a chemical reaction are
the **reactants** . So hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants. The
**product** is the end result of a reaction. In this example, water is
the product.

Atoms also come together to form compounds much larger than water. It is
some of these large compounds that come together to form the basis of
the cell. So essentially, your cells are made out of compounds, which
are made out of atoms.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-mrp}

-   Elements are substances that cannot be broken down into simpler
    substances with different properties.
-   Elements have been organized by their properties to form the
    periodic table.
-   Two or more atoms can combine to form a molecule.
-   Molecules consisting of more than one element are called compounds.
-   Reactants can combine through chemical reactions to form products.

**What makes up a healthy diet?**

A healthy diet includes protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Why? Because
these compounds are three of the main building blocks that make up your
body. You obtain these building blocks from the food that you eat, and
you use these building blocks to make the organic compounds necessary
for life.

### Organic Compounds {#2.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5pYyBDb21wb3VuZHM._9-6cp}

The main chemical components of living organisms are known as **organic
compounds** . Organic compounds are molecules built around the element
carbon (C). Living things are made up of very large molecules. These
large molecules are called **macromolecules** because “macro” means
large; they are made by smaller molecules bonding together. Our body
gets these smaller molecules, the "building blocks" or **monomers** , of
organic molecules from the food we eat. Which organic molecules do you
recognize from the list below?

The four main types of macromolecules found in living organisms, shown
in **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Zm91ci1jbGFzc2VzLW1vbGVjdWxlcw..) , are:

1.  Proteins.
2.  Carbohydrates.
3.  Lipids.
4.  Nucleic Acids.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 **Proteins**   **Carbohydrate **Lipids**     **Nucleic
                                s**                           Acids**
  -------------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  **Elements**   C, H, O, N, S  C, H, O        C, H, O, P     C, H, O, P, N

  **Examples**   Enzymes,       Sugar,         Fats, oils,    DNA, RNA, ATP
                 muscle fibers, glucose,       waxes,         
                 antibodies     starch,        steroids,      
                                glycogen,      phospholipids  
                                cellulose      in membranes   

  **Monomer      Amino acids    Monosaccharide Often include  Nucleotides
  (small                        s              fatty acids

  molecule)**                   sugars)                       
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Carbohydrates {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9oeWRyYXRlcw.._9-uly}

**Carbohydrates** are sugars, or long chains of sugars. An important
role of carbohydrates is to store energy. **Glucose** ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xMC1HbHVjb3Nl) ) is an important
simple sugar molecule with the chemical formula C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ .
Simple sugars are known as **monosaccharides** . Carbohydrates also
include long chains of connected sugar molecules. These long chains
often consist of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides bonded
together to form **polysaccharides** . Plants store sugar in
polysaccharides called **starch** . Animals store sugar in
polysaccharides called **glycogen** . You get the carbohydrates you need
for energy from eating carbohydrate-rich foods, including fruits and
vegetables, as well as grains, such as bread, rice, or corn.

#### Proteins {#2.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbnM._9-tqm}

**Proteins** are molecules that have many different functions in living
things. All proteins are made of monomers called **amino acids** (
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xMy1BbWluby1hY2lkLXN0cnVjdHVyZQ..) )
that connect together like beads on a necklace ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xMS1BbWluby1hY2lkcw..) ). There are
only 20 common amino acids needed to build proteins. These amino acids
form in thousands of different combinations, making about 100,000 or
more unique proteins in humans. Proteins can differ in both the number
and order of amino acids. It is the number and order of amino acids that
determines the shape of the protein, and it is the shape (structure) of
the protein that determines the unique function of the protein. Small
proteins have just a few hundred amino acids. The largest proteins have
more than 25,000 amino acids.

Many important molecules in your body are proteins. Examples include
enzymes, antibodies, and muscle fiber. **Enzymes** are a type of protein
that speed up chemical reactions. They are known as "biological
catalysts." For example, your stomach would not be able to break down
food if it did not have special enzymes to speed up the rate of
digestion. **Antibodies** that protect you against disease are proteins.
Muscle fiber is mostly protein ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xMi1NdXNjbGUtRmliZXI.) ).

It’s important for you and other animals to eat food with protein,
because we cannot make certain amino acids on our own. You can get
proteins from plant sources, such as beans, and from animal sources,
like milk or meat. When you eat food with protein, your body breaks the
proteins down into individual amino acids and uses them to build new
proteins. You really are what you eat!

#### Lipids {#2.html#x-ck12-TGlwaWRz_9-0w6}

Have you ever tried to put oil in water? They don’t mix. Oil is a type
of lipid. **Lipids** are molecules such as fats, oils, and waxes. The
most common lipids in your diet are probably fats and oils. Fats are
solid at room temperature, whereas oils are fluid. Animals use fats for
long-term energy storage and to keep warm. Plants use oils for long-term
energy storage. When preparing food, we often use animal fats, such as
butter, or plant oils, such as olive oil or canola oil. There are many
more type of lipids that are important to life. One of the most
important are the **phospholipids** that make up the protective outer
membrane of all cells ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xNC1QaG9zcGhvbGlwaWRz) ). These lipid
membranes are impermeable to most water soluble compounds.

#### Nucleic acids {#2.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVpYyBhY2lkcw.._9-6ar}

**Nucleic acids** are long chains of nucleotides. Nucleotides are made
of a sugar, a nitrogen-containing base, and a phosphate group.
**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** and **ribonucleic acid (RNA)** are the
two main nucleic acids. DNA is a double-stranded nucleic acid. DNA is
the molecule that stores our genetic information ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xNS1ETkE.) ). The single-stranded RNA
is involved in making proteins. **ATP (adenosine triphosphate)** , known
as the "energy currency" of the cell, is also a nucleic acid.

**How would you classify a horse?**

It's easy enough to classify the horse in the animal kingdom. That's one
level of classification. But what other groups does the horse belong to?
Horses also belong to a class—the mammals. These animals all have fur
and nurse their young.

### Classification of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgTGlmZQ.._10-jkd}

When you see an organism that you have never seen before, you probably
put it into a group without even thinking. If it is green and leafy, you
probably call it a plant. If it is long and slithers, you probably call
it as a snake. How do you make these decisions? You look at the physical
features of the organism and think about what it has in common with
other organisms.

Scientists do the same thing when they **classify** , or put into
categories, living things. Scientists classify organisms not only by
their physical features, but also by how closely related they are. Lions
and tigers look like each other more than they look like bears, but are
lions and tigers related? Evolutionarily speaking, yes. **Evolution** is
the change in a species over time. Lions and tigers both evolved from a
common ancestor. So it turns out that the two cats are actually more
closely related to each other than to bears. How an organism looks and
how it is related to other organisms determines how it is classified.

#### Linnaean System of Classification {#2.html#x-ck12-TGlubmFlYW4gU3lzdGVtIG9mIENsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u_10-3bg}

People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of
years. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a
classification system that divided living things into several groups
that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles.

Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778) ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0xNi1DYXJvbHVzLUxpbm5lYXVz) ) built on
Aristotle’s work to create his own classification system. He invented
the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word
name. Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern **taxonomy** , the
science of naming and grouping organisms.

![Portrait of Carl Linnaeus, the inventor of modern
taxonomy](ck12_2_files/20150911112846060526.png "Portrait of Carl Linnaeus, the inventor of modern taxonomy")

**Figure 2.29**

In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of
naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete
classification system then known.

</div>

Linnaeus developed **binomial nomenclature** , a way to give a
scientific name to every organism. In this system, each organism
receives a two-part name in which the first word is the **genus** (a
group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that
genus. For example, a coyote's species name is *Canis latrans* .
*Latrans* is the species and *Canis* is the genus, a larger group that
includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another
example: the red maple, *Acer rubra* , and the sugar maple, *Acer
saccharum* , are both in the same genus and they look similar (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-bWFwbGU.) ). Notice that the genus is
capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name
is in italics. Tigers *(Panthera tigris)* and lions *(Panthera leo)*
 have the same genus name, but are obviously different species. The
names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called
Latin.

#### Modern Classification {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9kZXJuIENsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u_10-7oi}

Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since
Linnaeus. The main categories that biologists use are listed here from
the most specific to the least specific category ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0yMC1DbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg..) ). All
organisms can be classified into one of three **domains** , the least
specific grouping. The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain. All life is divided
among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista,
Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia.

Even though naming species is straightforward, deciding if two organisms
are the same species can sometimes be difficult. Linnaeus defined each
species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these
organisms. But two members of the same species may look quite different.
For example, people from different parts of the world sometimes look
very different, but we are all the same species ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0yMS1ncm91cC1vZi1jaGlsZHJlbg..) ).

So how is a species defined? A **species** is defined as a group of
similar individuals that can interbreed with one another and produce
fertile offspring. A species does not produce fertile offspring with
other species.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-mgh}

-   Scientists have defined several major categories for classifying
    organisms: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus,
    and species.
-   The scientific name of an organism consists of its genus
    and species.

**What do you have in common with pond scum?**

Humans are in the same domain as trees and algae, which makes up the
"pond scum" you see here. What could they possibly have in common? It is
the location of their DNA inside their cells. Their cells all have a
nucleus that is home to their genetic material.

### The Domains of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIERvbWFpbnMgb2YgTGlmZQ.._11-zmo}

Let’s explore the **domain** , the least specific category of
classification.

All of life can be divided into three domains, based on the type of cell
of the organism:

1.  **Bacteria** : cells do not contain a nucleus.
2.  **Archaea** : cells do not contain a nucleus; they have a different
    cell wall from bacteria.
3.  **Eukarya** : cells do contain a nucleus.

#### Archaea and Bacteria {#2.html#x-ck12-QXJjaGFlYSBhbmQgQmFjdGVyaWE._11-9po}

The Archaea and Bacteria domains ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDEtMTItTGlmZQ..) ) are both entirely
composed of small, single-celled organisms and seem very similar, but
they also have significant differences. Both are composed of
**prokaryotic cells** , which are cells without a nucleus. In addition,
both domains are composed of species that reproduce asexually (
**asexual reproduction** ) by dividing in two. Both domains also have
species with cells surrounded by a **cell wall** , however, the cell
walls are made of different materials. Bacterial cell walls contain the
polysaccharide **peptidoglycan** . Lastly, Archaea often live in extreme
environments including hot springs, geysers, and salt flats. Bacteria do
not live in these environments.

The Group A *Streptococcus* organism ( *left* ) is in the domain
Bacteria, one of the three domains of life. The *Halobacterium* (
*right* ) is in the domain Archaea, another one of the three domains.

</div>

#### Eukarya {#2.html#x-ck12-RXVrYXJ5YQ.._11-aws}

All of the cells in the domain Eukarya keep their genetic material, or
**DNA** , inside the **nucleus** . The domain Eukarya is made up of four
kingdoms:

1.  Plantae: Plants, such as trees and grasses, survive by capturing
    energy from the sun, a process called **photosynthesis** .
2.  Fungi: Fungi, such as mushrooms and molds, survive by "eating" other
    organisms or the remains of other organisms. These organisms absorb
    their nutrients from other organisms.
3.  Animalia: Animals also survive by eating other organisms or the
    remains of other organisms. Animals range from tiny ants to the
    largest whales, and include arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles,
    and mammals ( **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTAxLWFuaW1hbC1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) ).
4.  Protista: Protists are not all descended from a single common
    ancestor in the way that plants, animals, and fungi are. Protists
    are all the eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into one of the
    other three kingdoms. They include many kinds of microscopic
    one-celled (unicellular) organisms, such as algae and plankton, but
    also giant seaweeds that can grow to be 200 feet long.

Plants, animals, fungi, and protists might seem very different, but
remember that if you look through a microscope, you will find similar
cells with a membrane-bound nucleus in all of them. These are
**eukaryotic cells** . These cells also have membrane-bound
**organelles** , which prokaryotic cells lack. The main characteristics
of the three domains of life are summarized in **Table**

**What causes the common cold?**

That miserable cough and runny nose is caused by one villain: a virus.
Viruses come in many different shapes, including the prickly balls you
see here. They are so tiny that they can only be seen with a very
powerful microscope.

### What is a Virus? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIFZpcnVzPw.._12-snv}

We have all heard of viruses. The flu, the common cold, and many other
diseases are caused by viruses. But what is a virus? Do you think
viruses are living? Which domain do they belong to? Bacteria? Archaea?
Eukarya?

#### Are Viruses Alive? {#2.html#x-ck12-QXJlIFZpcnVzZXMgQWxpdmU__12-xsf}

The answer is actually “no.” A **virus** is essentially DNA or RNA
surrounded by a coat of protein ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMi0yNi1CYWN0ZXJpb3BoYWdl) ). It is not
made of a **cell** , and cannot maintain a stable internal environment (
**homeostasis** ). Recall that a cell is the basic unit of living
organisms. So if a virus is not made of at least one cell, can it be
living? Viruses also cannot reproduce on their own—they need to infect a
**host cell** to reproduce. So a virus is very different from any of the
organisms that fall into the three domains of life.

Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important
traits with living organisms. They have **genetic material** like all
cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve. The
genetic material of a virus can change (mutate), altering the traits of
the virus. As the process of **evolution** has resulted in all life on
the planet today, the classification of viruses has been controversial.
It calls into question the very definition of life.

**Figure 2.35**

These little "alien" looking creatures are viruses, and these specific
viruses infect *Escherichia coli* bacteria. Shown is a representation of
viruses infecting a cell. The virus lands on the outside of the cell and
injects its genetic material into the cell.

</div>

#### Replication {#2.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24._12-tdh}

Viruses infect a variety of organisms, including plants, animals, and
bacteria, injecting its genetic material into a cell of the host
organism. Once inside the host cell, they use the cell’s own **ATP**
(energy), **ribosomes** , **enzymes** , and other cellular parts to make
copies of themselves. The host cell makes a copy of the viral DNA and
produces viral proteins. These are then packaged into new viruses. So
viruses cannot **replicate** or reproduce on their own; they rely on a
host cell to make additional viruses.

#### Viruses and Human Disease {#2.html#x-ck12-VmlydXNlcyBhbmQgSHVtYW4gRGlzZWFzZQ.._12-yfc}

Viruses cause many human diseases. In addition to the flu and the common
cold, viruses cause rabies, diarrheal diseases, **AIDS** , cold sores,
and many other diseases ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTE2LWNvbGQtc29yZQ..) ). Viral diseases
range from mild to fatal.

## Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-ybi}

Biology is the study of life, so the Life Sciences are essentially, the
study of biology. The scientific method is the process by which
biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been
identified. This has resulted in a number of important biological
scientific theories, including the cell theory and the theory of
evolution. All life is built around the element carbon, and four
categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and
nucleic acids. One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological
catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at the rate
necessary to maintain life. All life can be classified into three
domains. All members of these domains share characteristics in common.
Viruses do not share all of the characteristics of life, and so many
scientists do not consider viruses to be living.

**What is a cell?**

It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the
smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit
necessary for life. But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life.
And as shown above, a cell may be filled with all sorts of structures,
each with its own specific function. This concept will discuss some of
the fundamental properties of the cell, with lessons that include the
cell structure, transport in and out of the cell, energy metabolism, and
cell division and reproduction.

**What are you made of?**

Cells make up all living things, including your own body. This picture
shows a typical group of cells. But not all cells look alike. Cells can
differ in shape and sizes. And the different shapes usually means
different functions.

### Introduction to Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIENlbGxz-v4e}

A **cell** is the smallest structural and functional unit of an
organism. Some organisms, like bacteria, consist of only one cell. Big
organisms, like humans, consist of trillions of cells. Compare a human
to a banana. On the outside, they look very different, but if you look
close enough you’ll see that their cells are actually very similar.

#### Observing Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-T2JzZXJ2aW5nIENlbGxz-dsi}

Most cells are so small that you cannot see them without the help of a
**microscope** . It was not until 1665 that English scientist Robert
Hooke invented a basic light microscope and observed cells for the first
time, by looking at a piece of cork. You may use light microscopes in
the classroom. You can use a light microscope to see cells ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0wMS1Pbmlvbi1DZWxscw..) ). But many
structures in the cell are too small to see with a light microscope. So,
what do you do if you want to see the tiny structures inside of cells?

In the 1950s, scientists developed more powerful microscopes. A light
microscope sends a beam of light through a specimen, or the object you
are studying. A more powerful microscope, called an **electron
microscope** , passes a beam of electrons through the specimen. Sending
electrons through a cell allows us to see its smallest parts, even the
parts inside the cell ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0wMi1lbGVjdHJvbi1taWNyb3Njb3Bl) ).
Without electron microscopes, we would not know what the inside of a
cell looked like.

An electron microscope allows scientists to see much more detail than a
light microscope, as with this sample of pollen.

</div>

#### Cell Theory {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBUaGVvcnk.-chm}

In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hooke’s first
microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypothesis that cells only come
from other cells. For example, bacteria, which are single-celled
organisms, divide in half (after they grow some) to make new bacteria.
In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you
already have. In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed
before. This idea led to the development of one of the most important
theories in biology, the **cell theory** .

Cell theory states that:

1.  All organisms are composed of cells.
2.  Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in
    all organisms.
3.  All cells come from other cells.

As with other scientific theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of
experiments support the cell theory. Since Virchow created the theory,
no evidence has ever been identified to contradict it.

#### Specialized Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-U3BlY2lhbGl6ZWQgQ2VsbHM.-zlk}

Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also
can be very different ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDItMDEtMDQtY2VsbHM.) ). Each cell in
your body is designed for a specific task. In other words, the cell's
function is partly based on the cell's structure. For example:

-   Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and
    brings it to other body cells.
-   Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of
    communication with other nerve cells, like a wire. Because of this
    shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of
    touching a hot stove, to your brain.
-   Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body.

As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs.
Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized
cells in their bodies.

#### Levels of Organization {#3.html#x-ck12-TGV2ZWxzIG9mIE9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbg..-73l}

While cells are the basic units of an organism, groups of cells can
perform a job together. These cells are called specialized because they
have a special job. Specialized cells can be organized into **tissues**
. For example, your liver cells are organized into liver tissue. Your
liver tissue is further organized into an organ, your liver. **Organs**
are formed from two or more specialized tissues working together to
perform a job. All organs, from your heart to your liver, are made up of
an organized group of tissues.

These organs are part of a larger system, the **organ systems** . For
example, your brain works together with your spinal cord and other
nerves to form the nervous system. This organ system must be organized
with other organ systems, such as the circulatory system and the
digestive system, for your body to work. Organ systems work together to
form the entire organism. There are many levels of organization in
living things ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0wN2xldmVscy1vZi1vcmdhbml6YXRpb24.) ).

**Are bacteria cells like our cells?**

Yes and no. Bacteria cells are similar to our cells in some ways. Like
our cells, bacteria cells have DNA and a plasma membrane. But bacteria
are unique in other ways. They are called prokaryotic cells because of
these differences.

### Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90aWMgYW5kIEV1a2FyeW90aWM._1-bar}

There are two basic types of cells, **prokaryotic cells** and
**eukaryotic cells** . The main difference between eukaryotic and
prokaryotic cells is that eukaryotic cells have a **nucleus** . The
nucleus is where cells store their **DNA** , which is the genetic
material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic cells do
not have a nucleus. Instead, their DNA floats around inside the cell.
Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called **prokaryotes** . All
prokaryotes are single-celled (unicellular) organisms. Bacteria and
Archaea are the only prokaryotes. Organisms with eukaryotic cells are
called **eukaryotes** . Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are
eukaryotes. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotes. Eukaryotes may
also be single-celled.

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common. All
cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA. The
**plasma membrane** , or cell membrane, is the phospholipid layer that
surrounds the cell and protects it from the outside environment.
**Ribosomes** are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are
made, a process called **protein synthesis.** The **cytoplasm** is all
the contents of the cell inside the cell membrane, not including the
nucleus.

#### Eukaryotic Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-RXVrYXJ5b3RpYyBDZWxscw.._1-zxt}

Eukaryotic cells usually have multiple **chromosomes** , composed of DNA
and protein. Some eukaryotic species have just a few chromosomes, others
have close to 100 or more. These chromosomes are protected within the
nucleus. In addition to a nucleus, eukaryotic cells include other
membrane-bound structures called **organelles** . Organelles allow
eukaryotic cells to be more specialized than prokaryotic cells. Pictured
below are the organelles of eukaryotic cells ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0wOS1ldWthcnlvdGVz) ), including the
**mitochondria** , **endoplasmic reticulum** , and **Golgi apparatus** .
These will be discussed in additional concepts.

Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and various other special
compartments surrounded by membranes, called organelles. The nucleus is
where the DNA (chromatin) is stored. Organelles give eukaryotic cells
more functions than prokaryotic cells.

#### Prokaryotic Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90aWMgQ2VsbHM._1-dxu}

Prokaryotic cells ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0wOC1wcm9rYXJ5b3Rlcw..) ) are usually
smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells. They do not have a nucleus or
other membrane-bound organelles. In prokaryotic cells, the DNA, or
genetic material, forms a single large circle that coils up on itself.
The DNA is located in the main part of the cell.

**Who guards your cells?**

Not everything can make it into your cells. Your cells have a plasma
membrane that helps to guard your cells from unwanted intruders.

### The Plasma Membrane and Cytosol {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsYXNtYSBNZW1icmFuZSBhbmQgQ3l0b3NvbA.._2-abx}

If the outside environment of a cell is water-based, and the inside of
the cell is also mostly water, something has to make sure the cell stays
intact in this environment. What would happen if a cell dissolved in
water, like sugar does? Obviously, the cell could not survive in such an
environment. So something must protect the cell and allow it to survive
in its water-based environment. All cells have a barrier around them
that separates them from the environment and from other cells. This
barrier is called the **plasma membrane** , or cell membrane.

#### The Plasma Membrane {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsYXNtYSBNZW1icmFuZQ.._2-d97}

The plasma membrane ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbC1NZW1icmFuZS0x) ) is made of a double layer
of special lipids, known as **phospholipids** . The phospholipid is a
lipid molecule with a hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two
hydrophobic ("water-hating") tails. Because of the hydrophilic and
hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in
a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically
be in contact with water. Remember that there is water outside the cell,
and the **cytoplasm** inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the
phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the
cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall
that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane
acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the
cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay
structurally intact in its water-based environment.

The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out
of the cell. Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter
and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not
completely permeable. "Permeable" means that anything can cross a
barrier. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to
enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is **semipermeable**
, meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot.

**Figure 3.7**

Plasma membranes are primarily made up of phospholipids (orange). The
hydrophilic ("water-loving") head and two hydrophobic ("water-hating")
tails are shown. The phospholipids form a bilayer (two layers). The
middle of the bilayer is an area without water. There can be water on
either side of the bilayer. There are many proteins throughout the
membrane.

</div>

#### Cytosol {#3.html#x-ck12-Q3l0b3NvbA.._2-q6i}

The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called
**cytosol** . Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules,
including **enzymes** , which are proteins that speed up the cell’s
chemical reactions. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like
fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all
of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell. The
cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not
have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-bjn}

-   The plasma membrane is formed by a phospholipid bilayer.
-   The plasma membrane controls what moves inside and outside the cell.

**Where is your DNA?**

You may know that a criminal can easily leave DNA at a crime scene. How?
DNA is found in every cell of your body. In each cell there is a
nucleus, which is home to your DNA. So if a criminal has a cut, and
blood is left at the crime scene, or a hair falls out and is left
behind, then DNA will also be left at the scene.

### The Nucleus {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE51Y2xldXM._3-rtv}

The **nucleus** is only found in eukaryotic cells. It contains most of
the genetic material (the **DNA** ) of the cell. The genetic material of
the nucleus is like a set of instructions. These instructions tell the
cell how to build molecules needed for the cell to function properly.
That is, the DNA tells the cell how to build molecules needed for life.
The nucleus is surrounded by the **nuclear envelope** , a double
membrane (two phospholipid bilayers) that controls what goes in and out
of the nucleus. The nucleus also has holes embedded in the nuclear
envelope. These holes are known as **nuclear pores** , and they allow
things to flow in and out of the nucleus. 

#### Chromosomes {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tZXM._3-8nn}

Inside of the nucleus, you will find the **chromosomes** . Chromosomes
are strands of DNA wrapped around proteins. They contain **genes** , or
small units of genetic material (DNA) that contains the code for the
creation of a protein. Human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). There
are hundreds to thousands of genes on each chromosome. 

#### Nucleolus {#3.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVvbHVz_3-bmc}

The nucleus of many cells also contains a central region called the
**nucleolus** . The job of the nucleolus is to build ribosomes. These
ribosomes flow out the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. **Ribosomes**
are organelles that make proteins in the cytoplasm. See the composition
of the nucleus pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDMtMTAtbnVjbGV1cw..) ).

**Do brain cells have the same internal structures as your other
cells?**

Yes. Although brain cells look quite different from your other cells,
they have the same internal structures as other cells. They need the
same structures because they need to perform the same tasks, such as
making proteins and obtaining energy.

### Organelles {#3.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5lbGxlcw.._4-cwy}

Eukaryotic cells have many specific functions, so it can be said that a
cell is like a factory. A factory has many machines and people, and each
has a specific role. Just like a factory, the cell is made up of many
different parts. Each part has a special role. The different parts of
the cell are called **organelles** , which means "small organs." All
organelles are found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are
"simpler" than eukaryotic cells. Though prokaryotic cells still have
many functions, they are not as specialized as eukaryotic cells, lacking
membrane-bound organelles. Thus, most organelles are not found in
prokaryotic cells.

Below are the main organelles found in eukaryotic cells ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0wOS1ldWthcnlvdGVz) ):

1.  The **nucleus** of a cell is like a safe containing the factory's
    trade secrets. The nucleus contains the genetic material (DNA), the
    information needed to build thousands of proteins.
2.  The **mitochondria** are the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria
    are the organelles where cellular energy is produced, providing the
    energy needed to power chemical reactions. This process, known as
    **cellular respiration** , produces energy is in the form of **ATP**
    (adenosine triphosphate). Cells that use a lot of energy may have
    thousands of mitochondria.
3.  **Vesicles** are small membrane bound sacs that transport materials
    around the cell and to the cell membrane.
4.  The **vacuoles** are like storage centers. Plant cells have larger
    vacuoles than animal cells. Plants store water and nutrients in
    their large central vacuoles.
5.  **Lysosomes** are like the recycling trucks that carry waste away
    from the factory. Lysosomes have digestive enzymes that break down
    old molecules into parts that can be recycled.
6.  In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, **ribosomes** are the
    non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made. Ribosomes are
    like the machines in the factory that produce the factory's
    main product. Proteins are the main product of the cell.
7.  Some ribosomes can be found on folded membranes called the
    **endoplasmic reticulum** (ER), others float freely in
    the cytoplasm. If the ER is covered with ribosomes, it looks bumpy
    like sandpaper, and is called the rough endoplasmic reticulum. If
    the ER does not contain ribosomes, it is smooth and called the
    smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Many proteins are made on the
    ribosomes on the rough ER. These proteins immediately enter the ER,
    where they are modified, packaged into vesicles and sent to the
    Golgi apparatus. Lipids are made in the smooth ER.
8.  The **Golgi apparatus** works like a mail room. The Golgi apparatus
    receives proteins from the rough ER and puts "shipping addresses"
    on them. The Golgi then packages the proteins into vesicles and
    sends them to the right place in the cell or to the cell membrane.
    Some of these proteins are secreted from the cell (they exit the
    cell); others are placed into the cell membrane.

**Do plants have cells like yours?**

Yes, your cells are actually very similar to a plant's cells. For
example, they are both eukaryotic cells, both contain DNA in a nucleus,
and both make proteins in ribosomes. However, plant cells also differ in
some crucial ways from your own cells.

### Plant Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgQ2VsbHM._5-eph}

Even though plants and animals are both eukaryotes, plant cells differ
in some ways from animal cells ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0xMi1wbGFudC1jZWxs) ). Plant cells have
a large central vacuole, are surrounded by a cell wall, and have
chloroplasts, which are the organelles of **photosynthesis** .
Photosynthesis converts the sun's solar energy into chemical energy.
This chemical energy, which is the carbohydrate glucose, serves as
"food" for the plant.

![Features of a plant
cell](ck12_3_files/20150911112925812857.png "Features of a plant cell")

**Figure 3.10**

A plant cell has several features that make it different from an animal
cell, including a cell wall, huge vacuoles, and chloroplasts, which
photosynthesize.

</div>

#### Vacuoles {#3.html#x-ck12-VmFjdW9sZXM._5-jf0}

First, plant cells have a large central **vacuole** that holds a mixture
of water, nutrients, and wastes. A plant cell's vacuole can make up 90%
of the cell’s volume. The large central vacuole essentially stores
water. In animal cells, vacuoles are much smaller.

#### Cell Wall {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBXYWxs_5-voe}

Second, plant cells have a **cell wall** , while animal cells do not (
**Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wMy0xMy1wbGFudC1jZWxsLW1pY3Jvc2NvcGU.) ).
The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane but does not keep substances
from entering or leaving the cell. A cell wall gives the plant cell
strength and protection.

**Figure 3.11**

In this photo of plant cells taken with a light microscope, you can see
green chloroplasts, as well as a cell wall around each cell.

</div>

#### Plastids {#3.html#x-ck12-UGxhc3RpZHM._5-dvk}

A third difference between plant and animal cells is that plants have
several kinds of organelles called **plastids** . And there are several
different kinds of plastids in plant cells. For example,
**Chloroplasts** are needed for photosynthesis, leucoplasts can store
starch or oil, and brightly colored chromoplasts give some flowers and
fruits their yellow, orange, or red color. It is the presence of
chloroplasts and the ability to photosynthesize, that is one of the
defining features of a plant. No animal or fungi can photosynthesize,
and only some protists are able to. The photosynthetic protists are the
plant-like protists, represented mainly by the unicellular algae.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-gp9}

-   Plant and animal cells differ in that plants have a large central
    vacuole, while animals have smaller vacuoles.
-   Plant cells also have cell walls and plastids, while animal cells
    do not.

**How is a cell membrane like a castle wall?**

The walls of a castle, like the cell membrane, are designed to keep out
dangerous things. Whether you're concerned about an enemy army or a
disease-causing bacteria, you don't want to allow everything to enter!
However, in order to survive, there are some things that the cell (or
the castle) does need to let in.

### Introduction to Cell Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIENlbGwgVHJhbnNwb3J0_6-5kf}

Cells are found in all different types of environments, and these
environments are constantly changing. For example, one-celled organisms,
like bacteria, can be found on your skin, in the ground, or in all
different types of water. Therefore, cells need a way to protect
themselves. This job is done by the **cell membrane,** which is also
known as the plasma membrane.

#### Controlling the Cell Contents {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbGxpbmcgdGhlIENlbGwgQ29udGVudHM._6-ozz}

The cell membrane is **semipermeable** , or selectively permeable, which
means that only some molecules can pass through the membrane. If the
cell membrane were completely permeable, the inside of the cell would be
the same as the outside of the cell. It would be impossible for the cell
to maintain **homeostasis** . Homeostasis means maintaining a stable
internal environment. For example, if your body cells have a temperature
of 98.6°F, and it is freezing outside, your cells will maintain
homeostasis if the temperature of the cells stays the same and does not
drop with the outside temperature.

How does the cell ensure it is semipermeable? How does the cell control
what molecules enter and leave the cell? The composition of the cell
membrane helps to control what can pass through it.

#### Composition of the Cell Membrane {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG9zaXRpb24gb2YgdGhlIENlbGwgTWVtYnJhbmU._6-3n2}

Molecules in the cell membrane allow it to be semipermeable. The
membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids (a "bilayer") and
proteins ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wMS1waG9zcGhvbGlwaWQtYmlsYXllcg..) ).
Recall that phospholipids, being lipids, do not mix with water. It is
this quality that allows them to form the outside barrier of the cell.

A single phospholipid molecule has two parts:

1.  A polar head that is **hydrophilic** , or water-loving.
2.  A fatty acid tail that is **hydrophobic** , or water-fearing.

<div id="3.html#x-ck12-MzM5YjkzODFhODA3MDA5ZTMxMWI3ZDY4OTBhODQ3OTE.-dqr"
class="x-ck12-img-postcard x-ck12-nofloat">

![The composition of the cell
membrane](ck12_3_files/20150911112927641917.png "The composition of the cell membrane")

**Figure 3.12**

The cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer, two layers of
phospholipid molecules. Notice the polar head group of the phospholipid
is attached to the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty acid chains.
The head group and tails are attached by a glycerol backbone.

</div>

There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells. Since
hydrophilic means water-loving, and they want to be near water, the
heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found. The
water-fearing, hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the
cell membrane, because water is not found in this space. The
phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based
environment.

An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very "fluid"
and constantly moving, like a soap bubble. This fluid nature of the
membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis. It allows the proteins
in the membrane to float to areas where they are needed.  

Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as
oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely through the membrane, but
other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through
the plasma membrane. These molecules need assistance to get across the
membrane. That assistance will come in the form of **transport
proteins.**

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-tgh}

-   The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning only some
    molecules can get through.
-   The cell membrane is made of a double layer of phospholipids, each
    with a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a
    hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail.

**What happens if you put a few drops of food coloring in water?**

Over time, the molecules of color spread out through the rest of the
water. When the molecules are evenly spread throughout the space, the
water will become an even color. This process of molecules moving from
an area where there are lots of molecules to an area where there are
fewer molecules is known as diffusion.

### Diffusion {#3.html#x-ck12-RGlmZnVzaW9u_7-zpb}

Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process
called diffusion. **Diffusion** is the movement of molecules from an
area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the
substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount)
of the substance ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wMi1kaWZmdXNpb24.) ). The amount of a
substance in relation to the total volume is the **concentration** .
During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their **concentration
gradient** , flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of
low concentration. Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a
natural process and does not require energy.

Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell
membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists. Molecules will
continue to flow in this manner until **equilibrium** is reached. At
equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low
concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the
semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are
entering and leaving a cell.

toward an area of lower amount. A concentration gradient initially
exists across the cell membrane. Equilibrium is reached when there is an
equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane.

</div>

#### Osmosis {#3.html#x-ck12-T3Ntb3Npcw.._7-oak}

The diffusion of water across a membrane because of a difference in
concentration is called **osmosis** . Let's explore three different
situations and analyze the flow of water.

1.  A **hypotonic solution** means the environment outside of the cell
    has a lower concentration of dissolved material than the inside of
    the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will
    move into the cell. This causes the cell to swell, and it may
    even burst.
2.  A **hypertonic solution** means the environment outside of the cell
    has more dissolved material than inside of the cell. If a cell is
    placed in a hypertonic solution, water will leave the cell. This can
    cause a cell to shrink and shrivel.
3.  An **isotonic solution** is a solution in which the amount of
    dissolved material is equal both inside and outside of the cell.
    Water still flows in both directions, but an equal amount enters and
    leaves the cell.

#### Applications of Osmosis {#3.html#x-ck12-QXBwbGljYXRpb25zIG9mIE9zbW9zaXM._7-axw}

How do marine animals keep their cells from shrinking? How do you keep
your blood cells from bursting? Both of these questions have to do with
the cell membrane and osmosis. Marine animals live in salt water, which
is a hypertonic environment; there is more salt in the water than in
their cells. To prevent losing too much water from their bodies, these
animals intake large quantities of salt water and then secrete the
excess salt. Red blood cells can be kept from bursting or shriveling if
put in a solution that is isotonic to the blood cells. If the blood
cells were put in pure water, the solution would be hypotonic to the
blood cells, so water would enter the blood cells, and they would swell
and burst ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wMy1vc21vc2lz)
).

**Can any molecule move freely through your cell membranes?**

The cell regulates most molecules that pass through the cell membrane.
If a molecule is charged or very big, it won't make it through the cell
membrane on its own. However, small, non-charged molecules like oxygen,
carbon dioxide, and water, can pass through the cell membrane freely.

### Passive Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-UGFzc2l2ZSBUcmFuc3BvcnQ._8-roa}

Recall that the cell membrane is semipermeable. It does not allow
everything to pass through. Some molecules can pass easily through your
cell membranes, while others have more difficulty. Sometimes molecules
need the help of special transport proteins to move across the cell
membrane. Some molecules even need an input of energy to help get them
across the cell membrane. The movement of molecules across a membrane
without the input of energy is known as **passive transport** . When
energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as **active transport** .
Active transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient,
from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration.

#### Simple Diffusion {#3.html#x-ck12-U2ltcGxlIERpZmZ1c2lvbg.._8-heq}

One example of passive transport is **diffusion** , when molecules move
from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low
concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down
their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an
input of energy. In **simple diffusion** , molecules that are small and
uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow
through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or
need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged
molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a
protein.

Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For
example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your
bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in
your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your
lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon
dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high
concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs.

#### Passive Transport using Membrane Proteins {#3.html#x-ck12-UGFzc2l2ZSBUcmFuc3BvcnQgdXNpbmcgTWVtYnJhbmUgUHJvdGVpbnM._8-ko1}

Sometimes, molecules cannot move through the cell membrane on their own.
These molecules need special transport proteins to help them move across
the membrane, a process known as **facilitative diffusion** . These
special proteins are called **channel proteins** or **carrier proteins**
( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wNC1wYXNzaXZlLXRyYW5zcG9ydC1wcm90ZWlucw..)
), and they are attached to the cell membrane. In fact, they go through
the cell membrane, from the inside of the cell to the outside.

Channel proteins provide an open channel or passageway through the cell
membrane for molecules to move across. Many channel proteins allow the
diffusion of **ions.** Ions are charged atoms. The charge makes it
difficult to cross the cell membrane without assistance. Channel
proteins are specific for the molecule they transport. For example a
sodium ion crosses the membrane through a channel protein specific for
sodium ions.

Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across the cell membrane.
These proteins bind a molecule on one side of the membrane, change shape
as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule
on the other side of the membrane. Even though a protein is involved in
both these methods of transport, neither method requires energy.
Therefore these are still types of passive transport.

**What does it take to roll a stone uphill?**

This round stone tends to roll downhill due to the force of gravity. It
takes an input of energy to push it uphill. Due to diffusion, molecules
tend to move from an area of a large amount to an area of a small
amount. So guess what it takes to move molecules the opposite way, from
an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration? Energy,
of course!

### Active Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-QWN0aXZlIFRyYW5zcG9ydA.._9-zgh}

During **active transport,** molecules move from an area of low
concentration to an area of high concentration. This is the opposite of
**diffusion** , and these molecules are said to flow *against their
concentration gradient.* Active transport is called "active" because
this type of transport requires energy to move molecules. **ATP** is the
most common source of energy for active transport.

As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active
transport cannot occur without assistance. A **carrier protein** is
always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein
in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this
protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high
concentration. These proteins are often called "pumps" because they use
energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells
in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve
cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had
protein pumps moving molecules by active transport.

The **sodium-potassium pump** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wNS1zb2RpdW0tcG90YXNzaXVtLXB1bXA.) )
is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump
uses ATP to move three sodium (Na ^+^ ) ions and two potassium (K ^+^ )
ions to where they are already highly concentrated. Sodium ions move out
of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions
then return to their original positions? As the ions now can flow down
their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to
their original positions either inside or outside the cell.

**Figure 3.16**

The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions to the outside of the cell
and potassium ions to the inside of the cell, areas where these ions are
already highly concentrated. ATP is required for the protein to change
shape. ATP is converted into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) during active
transport.

</div>

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-kch}

-   During active transport, a protein pump uses energy, in the form of
    ATP, to move molecules from an area of low concentration to an area
    of high concentration.
-   An example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which
    moves sodium ions to the outside of the cell and potassium ions to

**What can a tiny plant do that you can't do?**

This tiny plant can use the energy of the sun to make its own food. You
can't make food by just sitting in the sun. Plants are not the only
organisms that can get energy from the sun, however. Some protists, such
as algae, and some bacteria can also use the energy of the sun to make
their own food.

### What is Photosynthesis? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBQaG90b3N5bnRoZXNpcz8._10-k1w}

If a plant gets hungry, it cannot walk to a local restaurant and buy a
slice of pizza. So, how does a plant get the food it needs to survive?
Plants are **producers** , which means they are able to make, or
produce, their own food. They also produce the "food" for other
organisms. Plants are also **autotrophs.** Autotrophs are the organisms
that collect the energy from the sun and turn it into organic compounds.
Using the energy from the sun, they produce complex organic compounds
from simple inorganic molecules. So once again, how does a plant get the
food it needs to survive?

Through photosynthesis. **Photosynthesis** is the process plants use to
make their own “food” from the sun's energy, carbon dioxide, and water.
During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water combine with solar
energy to create **glucose** , a carbohydrate (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ), and
oxygen.

The process can be summarized as: in the presence of sunlight, carbon
dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen.

Glucose, the main product of photosynthesis, is a sugar that acts as the
"food" source for plants. The glucose is then converted into usable
chemical energy, **ATP** , during **cellular respiration** . The oxygen
formed during photosynthesis, which is necessary for animal life, is
essentially a waste product of the photosynthesis process.

Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic
organisms. For example, if a bird eats a caterpillar, then the bird gets
the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats. So the
bird indirectly gets energy that began with the glucose formed through
photosynthesis. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is central to
sustaining life on Earth. In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs
in **chloroplasts** . Only cells with chloroplasts—plant cells and algal
(protist) cells—can perform photosynthesis. Animal cells and fungal
cells do not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize.
That is why these organisms, as well as the non-photosynthetic protists,
rely on other organisms to obtain their energy. These organisms are
**heterotrophs.**

**Are plants the only organisms that perform photosynthesis?**

Although we generally discuss plants when learning about photosynthesis,
keep in mind that plants are not the only organisms that can make their
own food. Some bacteria and some protists, such as the algae pictured
here, also perform photosynthesis. This alga has chloroplasts and
photosynthesizes just like a plant.

### The Process of Photosynthesis {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByb2Nlc3Mgb2YgUGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXM._11-sie}

#### In the Presence of Sunlight, Carbon Dioxide ![+](ck12_math_images_dir/04fc9c582e9c248c0cab7afb40405597.png) Water → Glucose ![+](ck12_math_images_dir/04fc9c582e9c248c0cab7afb40405597.png) Oxygen {#3.html#x-ck12-SW4gdGhlIFByZXNlbmNlIG9mIFN1bmxpZ2h0LCBDYXJib24gRGlveGlkZQ.._11-so9}

Photosynthesis takes place in the organelle of the plant cell known as
the chloroplasts. **Chloroplasts** are one of the main differences
between plant and animal cells. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts,
so they cannot photosynthesize. Photosynthesis occurs in two stages.
During the first stage, the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the
chloroplast. Water is used, and oxygen is produced during this part of
the process. During the second stage, carbon dioxide is used, and
glucose is produced.

Chloroplasts contain stacks of **thylakoids** , which are flattened sacs
of membrane. Energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment
**chlorophyll** in the thylakoid membrane. There are two separate parts
of a chloroplast: the space inside the chloroplast itself, and the space
inside the thylakoids ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wNi1jaGxvcm9wbGFzdC1wYXJ0cw..) ).

-   The inner compartments inside the thylakoids are called the
    thylakoid space (or lumen). This is the site of the first part
    of photosynthesis.
-   The interior space that surrounds the thylakoids is filled with a
    fluid called **stroma** . This is where carbon dioxide is used to
    produce glucose, the second part of photosynthesis.

#### The Reactants {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJlYWN0YW50cw.._11-3gp}

What goes into the plant cell to start photosynthesis? The **reactants**
of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water. These are the molecules
necessary to begin the process. But one more item is necessary, and that
is sunlight. All three components, carbon dioxide, water, and the sun's
energy are necessary for photosynthesis to occur. These three components
must meet in the chloroplast of the leaf cell for photosynthesis to
occur. How do these three components get to the cells in the leaf?

-   Chlorophyll is the green pigment in leaves that captures energy from
    the sun. Chlorophyll molecules are located in the thylakoid
    membranes inside chloroplasts.
-   The *veins* in a plant carry water from the roots to the leaves.
-   Carbon dioxide enters the leaf from the air through special openings
    called **stomata** ( **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wNy1sZWFmLXN0b21hdGE.) ).

Stomata are special pores that allow gasses to enter and exit the leaf.

#### The Products {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByb2R1Y3Rz_11-z12}

What is produced by the plant cell during photosynthesis? The
**products** of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen. This means they
are produced at the end of photosynthesis. **Glucose** , the food of
plants, can be used to store energy in the form of large carbohydrate
molecules. Glucose is a simple sugar molecule which can be combined with
other glucose molecules to form large carbohydrates, such as starch.
Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis. It is released into the
atmosphere through the stomata. As you know, animals need oxygen to
live. Without photosynthetic organisms like plants, there would not be
enough oxygen in the atmosphere for animals to survive.

#### The Chemical Reaction {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENoZW1pY2FsIFJlYWN0aW9u_11-ayf}

The overall chemical reaction for photosynthesis is 6 molecules of
carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and 6 molecules of water (H ~2~ O), with the
addition of solar energy. This produces 1 molecule of glucose (C ~6~ H
~12~ O ~6~ ) and 6 molecules of oxygen (O ~2~ ). Using chemical symbols,
the equation is represented as follows: 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O → C ~6~ H
~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ . Though this equation may not seem that
complicated, photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions divided
into two stages, the light reactions and the Calvin cycle ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wOC1waG90b3N5bnRoZXNpcy1zY2hlbWU.) ).

#### The Light Reactions {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExpZ2h0IFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._11-gh0}

Photosynthesis begins with the **light reactions.** It is during these
reactions that the energy from sunlight is absorbed by the pigment
chlorophyll in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. The energy is
then temporarily transferred to two molecules, ATP and NADPH, which are
used in the second stage of photosynthesis. ATP and NADPH are generated
by two **electron transport chains** . During the light reactions, water
is used and oxygen is produced. These reactions can only occur during
daylight as the process needs sunlight to begin.

#### The Calvin Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENhbHZpbiBDeWNsZQ.._11-zlq}

The second stage of photosynthesis is the production of glucose from
carbon dioxide. This process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after
its discover, Melvin Calvin. The **Calvin cycle** uses CO ~2~ and the
energy temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH to make the sugar glucose.

**Figure 3.19**

Photosynthesis is a two stage process. As is depicted here, the energy
from sunlight is needed to start photosynthesis. The initial stage is
called the light reactions as they occur only in the presence of light.
During these initial reactions, water is used and oxygen is released.
The energy from sunlight is converted into a small amount of ATP and an
energy carrier called NADPH. Together with carbon dioxide, these are
used to make glucose (sugar) through a process called the Calvin Cycle.
NADP ^+^ and ADP (and Pi, inorganic phosphate) are regenerated to
complete the process.

**Why do you need food?**

The main reason you need to eat is to get energy. Food is your body's
only supply of energy. However, this energy must be converted from the
apple (or any other food you eat) into an energy source that your body
can use. The process of getting energy from your food is called cellular
respiration.

### What is Cellular Respiration? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBDZWxsdWxhciBSZXNwaXJhdGlvbj8._12-qti}

How does the food you eat provide energy? When you need a quick boost of
energy, you might reach for an apple or a candy bar. But cells do not
"eat" apples or candy bars; these foods need to be broken down so that
cells can use them. Through the process of **cellular respiration** ,
the energy in food is changed into energy that can be used by the body's
cells. Initially, the sugars in the food you eat are digested into the
simple sugar **glucose** , a **monosaccharide** . Recall that glucose is
the sugar produced by the plant during photosynthesis. The glucose, or
the **polysaccharide** made from many glucose molecules, such as
**starch** , is then passed to the organism that eats the plant. This
organism could be you, or it could be the organism that you eat. Either
way, it is the glucose molecules that holds the energy.

#### ATP {#3.html#x-ck12-QVRQ_12-aeq}

Specifically, during cellular respiration, the energy stored in glucose
is transferred to ATP ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfY2hlbWljYWxz) ). **ATP** , or adenosine
triphosphate, is chemical energy the cell can use. It is the molecule
that provides energy for your cells to perform work, such as moving your
muscles as you walk down the street. But cellular respiration is
slightly more complicated than just converting the energy from glucose
into ATP. Cellular respiration can be described as the reverse or
opposite of photosynthesis. During cellular respiration, glucose, in the
presence of oxygen, is converted into carbon dioxide and water. Recall
that carbon dioxide and water are the starting products of
photosynthesis. What are the products of photosynthesis?

The process can be summarized as: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide +
water. During this process, the energy stored in glucose is transferred
to ATP.

Energy is stored in the bonds between the phosphate groups (PO ~4~ ^-^ )
of the ATP molecule. When ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine
diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate, energy is released. When ADP and
inorganic phosphate are joined to form ATP, energy is stored. During
cellular respiration, about 36 to 38 ATP molecules are produced for
every glucose molecule.

**Why do you need to breathe?**

Of course if you didn't breathe, you couldn't survive. Why do you need
air to live? You need the gas oxygen to perform cellular respiration to
get energy from your food.

### The Process of Cellular Respiration {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByb2Nlc3Mgb2YgQ2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24._13-x6d}

**Cellular respiration** is the process of extracting energy in the form
of **ATP** from the glucose in the food you eat. How does cellular
respiration happen inside of the cell? Cellular respiration is a three
step process. Briefly:

1.  In stage one, glucose is broken down in the cytoplasm of the cell in
    a process called **glycolysis** .
2.  In stage two, the pyruvate molecules are transported into
    the mitochondria. The **mitochondria** are the organelles known as
    the energy "powerhouses" of the cells ( **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0wOS1taXRvY2hvbmRyaWE.) ). In the
    mitochondria, the pyruvate, which have been converted into a
    2-carbon molecule, enter the **Krebs cycle.** Notice that
    mitochondria have an inner membrane with many folds, called
    **cristae** . These cristae greatly increase the membrane surface
    area where many of the cellular respiration reactions take place.
3.  In stage three, the energy in the energy carriers enters an
    **electron transport chain** . During this step, this energy is used
    to produce ATP.

Oxygen is needed to help the process of turning glucose into ATP. The
initial step releases just two molecules of ATP for each glucose. The
later steps release much more ATP.

**Figure 3.21**

Most of the reactions of cellular respiration are carried out in the
mitochondria.

</div>

#### The Reactants {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJlYWN0YW50cw.._13-gtg}

What goes into the cell? Oxygen and glucose are both **reactants** of
cellular respiration. Oxygen enters the body when an organism breathes.
Glucose enters the body when an organism eats.

#### The Products {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByb2R1Y3Rz_13-2xf}

What does the cell produce? The **products** of cellular respiration are
carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide is transported from your
mitochondria out of your cell, to your red blood cells, and back to your
lungs to be exhaled. ATP is generated in the process. When one molecule
of glucose is broken down, it can be converted to a net total of 36 or
38 molecules of ATP. This only occurs in the presence of oxygen.

#### The Chemical Reaction {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENoZW1pY2FsIFJlYWN0aW9u_13-ucx}

The overall chemical reaction for cellular respiration is one molecule
of glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ) and six molecules of oxygen (O ~2~ )
yields six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and six molecules of
water (H ~2~ O). Using chemical symbols the equation is represented as
follows:

C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ → 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O

ATP is generated during the process. Though this equation may not seem
that complicated, cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions
divided into three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron
transport chain.

#### Glycolysis {#3.html#x-ck12-R2x5Y29seXNpcw.._13-pnh}

Stage one of cellular respiration is glycolysis. Glycolysis is the
splitting, or *lysis* of glucose. Glycolysis converts the 6-carbon
glucose into two 3-carbon **pyruvate** molecules. This process occurs in
the cytoplasm of the cell, and it occurs in the presence or absence of
oxygen. During glycolysis a small amount of NADH is made as are four
ATP. Two ATP are used during this process, leaving a net gain of two ATP
from glycolysis.  The NADH temporarily holds energy, which will be used
in stage three.

#### The Krebs Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEtyZWJzIEN5Y2xl_13-g5f}

In the presence of oxygen, under **aerobic** conditions, pyruvate enters
the mitochondria to proceed into the Krebs cycle. The second stage of
cellular respiration is the transfer of the energy in pyruvate, which is
the energy initially in glucose, into two energy carriers, NADH and FADH
~2~ . A small amount of ATP is also made during this process. This
process occurs in a continuous cycle, named after its discover, Hans
Krebs. The Krebs cycle uses a 2-carbon molecule (acetyl-CoA) derived
from pyruvate and produces carbon dioxide.

#### The Electron Transport Chain {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVsZWN0cm9uIFRyYW5zcG9ydCBDaGFpbg.._13-16p}

Stage three of cellular respiration is the use of NADH and FADH ~2~ to
generate ATP. This occurs in two parts. First, the NADH and FADH ~2~
enter an electron transport chain, where their energy is used to pump,
by active transport, protons (H ^+^ ) out of the thylakoid. This
establishes a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. These
protons then flow down their concentration gradient, moving back into
the thylakoid by facilitated diffusion. During this process, ATP is made
by adding inorganic phosphate to ADP.  Most of the ATP produced during
cellular respiration is made during this stage.

For each glucose that starts cellular respiration, in the presence of
oxygen (aerobic conditions), 36-38 ATP are generated. Without oxygen,
under **anaerobic** conditions, much less (only two!) ATP are produced.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-wqg}

-   Most of the steps of cellular respiration take place in
    the mitochondria.
-   Oxygen and glucose are both reactants in the process of
    cellular respiration.
-   The main product of cellular respiration is ATP; waste products
    include carbon dioxide and water.

**How do trees help you breathe?**

Recall that trees release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. And
you need oxygen to breathe. Do you know why? So your cells can perform
cellular respiration and make ATP.

### Connecting Cellular Respiration and Photosynthesis {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29ubmVjdGluZyBDZWxsdWxhciBSZXNwaXJhdGlvbiBhbmQgUGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXM._14-enc}

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are connected through an
important relationship. This relationship enables life to survive as we
know it. The **products** of one process are the **reactants** of the
other. Notice that the equation for **cellular respiration** is the
direct opposite of **photosynthesis** :

-   Cellular Respiration: C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ → 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~
    O
-   Photosynthesis: 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O → C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~

Photosynthesis makes the glucose that is used in cellular respiration to
make ATP. The glucose is then turned back into carbon dioxide, which is
used in photosynthesis. While water is broken down to form oxygen during
photosynthesis, in cellular respiration oxygen is combined with hydrogen
to form water. While photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases
oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon
dioxide. It is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other
organisms for cellular respiration. We breathe in that oxygen, which is
carried through our blood to all our cells. In our cells, oxygen allows
cellular respiration to proceed. Cellular respiration works best in the
presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, much less ATP would be produced.

Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are important parts of the
carbon cycle. The **carbon cycle** is the pathways through which carbon
is recycled in the biosphere. While cellular respiration releases carbon
dioxide into the environment, photosynthesis pulls carbon dioxide out of
the atmosphere. The exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen during
photosynthesis ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNC0xMC1waG90b3N5dGhlc2lzLW92ZXJ2aWV3) )
and cellular respiration worldwide helps to keep atmospheric oxygen and
carbon dioxide at stable levels.

**How is wine made?**

You probably realize that grapes are needed to make wine. You might not
realize, however, that yeast are also central in the process of making
wine. Yeast take the sugars from the grapes and convert them into
alcohol through the process of fermentation.

### Fermentation {#3.html#x-ck12-RmVybWVudGF0aW9u_15-tnp}

Sometimes cells need to obtain energy from sugar, but there is no oxygen
present to complete cellular respiration. In this situation, cellular
respiration can be **anaerobic** , occurring in the absence of oxygen.
In this process, called **fermentation** , only the first step of
respiration, **glycolysis** , occurs, producing two ATP; no additional
ATP is produced. Therefore, the organism only obtains the two ATP
molecules per glucose molecule from glycolysis. Compared to the 36-38
ATP produced under **aerobic** conditions, **anaerobic respiration** is
not a very efficient process. Fermentation allows the first step of
cellular respiration to continue and produce some ATP, even without
oxygen.

Yeast (single-celled eukaryotic organisms) perform **alcoholic
fermentation** in the absence of oxygen. The products of alcoholic
fermentation are ethyl alcohol (drinking alcohol) and carbon dioxide
gas. This process is used to make common food and drinks. For example,
alcoholic fermentation is used to bake bread. The carbon dioxide bubbles
allow the bread to rise and become fluffy. Meanwhile, the alcohol
evaporates. In wine making, the sugars of grapes are fermented to
produce wine. The sugars are the starting materials for glycolysis.

Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out **lactic acid
fermentation.** Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our
muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise,
since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The
buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after
exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and
yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic
acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your
mouth for energy.

Pictured below are some products of fermentation ( **Figure**

**Do cells get worn out?**

Yes, just like this car, cells cannot last forever. Cells do eventually
wear out. At that point, they need to be replaced. This is one reason
that your cells divide. New cells that result after cells divide are
also used for growth and to repair cuts.

### Why Cells Divide {#3.html#x-ck12-V2h5IENlbGxzIERpdmlkZQ.._16-tbl}

Imagine the first stages of life. In humans and other animals, a sperm
fertilizes an egg, forming the first cell. But humans are made up of
trillions of cells, so where do the new cells come from? Remember that
according to the **cell theory,** all cells come from existing cells.
Once a sperm and egg cell unite and the first cell, called a **zygote,**
forms, an entire baby will develop. And each cell in that baby will be
genetically identical, meaning that each cell will have exactly the same
DNA.

How does a new life go from one cell to so many? The cell divides in
half, creating two cells. Then those two cells divide, for a total of
four cells. The new cells continue to divide and divide. One cell
becomes two, then four, then eight, and so on ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wMS1jZWxsLWRpdi1lbWJyeW8.) ). This
continual process of a cell dividing and creating two new cells is known
as **cell division.** Cell division is part of a cycle of cellular
growth and division known as the cell cycle—cells must grow before they
divide. The **cell cycle** describes the "life" of a eukayrotic cell. In
addition to cell division, the cell cycle includes the division of the
nucleus and the cytoplasm.

Most cell division produces genetically identical cells, meaning they
have the same DNA. The process of **mitosis,** which specifically is the
division of the nucleus, ensures that each cell has the same DNA. During
mitosis, the chromosomes equally separate, thus making sure each nucleus
in each resulting cell after cell division is genetically identical.

A special form of cell division, called **meiosis,** produces cells with
half as much DNA as the parent cell. These cells are used for
reproduction. In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those
organisms reproduce.

![Drawing of mitosis in a zygote to form an
embryo](ck12_3_files/20150911112933190201.jpeg "Drawing of mitosis in a zygote to form an embryo")

**Figure 3.24**

Cells divide repeatedly to produce an embryo. Previously the one-celled
zygote (the first cell of a new organism) divided to make two cells (a).
Each of the two cells divides to yield four cells (b), then the four
cells divide to make eight cells (c), and so on. Through cell division,
an entire embryo forms from one initial cell.

</div>

Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that
cell division is necessary for life:

1.  To grow and develop, you must form new cells. Imagine how often your
    cells must divide during a growth spurt. Growing just an inch
    requires countless cell divisions. Your body must produce new bone
    cells, new skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on.
2.  Cell division is also necessary to repair damaged cells. Imagine you
    cut your finger. After the scab forms, it will eventually disappear
    and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound. Where do these
    cells come from? Some of your existing skin cells divide and produce
    new cells.
3.  Your cells can also simply wear out. Over time you must replace old
    and worn-out cells. Cell division is essential to this process.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-cgx}

-   Cells must divide repeatedly for an embryo to develop or for you
    to grow.
-   Cells also divide in order to replace damaged or worn-out cells.

**Do cells have a life cycle?**

Yes, just like a butterfly passes through different phases, such as
caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult butterfly, there are a series of
phases in a cell's life as it gets ready to divide. The sequence of
phases leading up to cell division and then ending with cell division
itself is called the cell cycle.

### Cell Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBDeWNsZQ.._17-lnh}

The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully
controlled. The **cell cycle** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfY2VsbF9jeWNsZQ..) ) is the life cycle of
an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a
human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood,
adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of
phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a **zygote**
from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( **gamete** ).

The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components:
interphase and the mitotic phase. **Interphase** is the stage when the
cell mostly performs its “everyday” functions. For example, it is when a
kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also
gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the
mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis.

Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell
divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages:

1.  The first growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles
    in size and doubles the number of organelles.
2.  The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In
    other words, an identical copy of all the cell’s DNA is made. This
    ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical
    to that of the parental cell. This process is called **DNA
    replication** .
3.  The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will
    help the cell divide. At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to
    enter mitosis.

During **mitosis** , the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally
separated. One nucleus becomes two nuclei, each with an identical set of
**chromosomes** . Mitosis is followed by **cytokinesis** , when the
cytoplasm divides, resulting in two cells. After cytokinesis, cell
division is complete. The one parent cell (the dividing cell) forms two
genetically identical daughter cells (the cells that divide from the
parent cell). The term "genetically identical" means that each cell has
an identical set of DNA, and this DNA is also identical to that of the
parent cell. If the cell cycle is not carefully controlled, it can cause
a disease called **cancer** in which the cells divide out of control. A
tumor can result from this kind of growth.

**How is your DNA organized?**

Your DNA is organized into chromosomes, the pink structures pictured
above. Your DNA doesn't always look so pretty, though. It only winds
tightly into chromosomes when the cell is getting ready to divide. If
your DNA wasn't organized into chromosomes, your DNA would look like a
mass of strings and would be difficult to divide up!

### Mitosis and Chromosomes {#3.html#x-ck12-TWl0b3NpcyBhbmQgQ2hyb21vc29tZXM._18-y93}

The genetic information of the cell, or DNA, is stored in the
**nucleus** . During **mitosis** , two nuclei (plural for nucleus) must
form, so that one nucleus can be in each of the new cells after the cell
divides. In order to create two genetically identical nuclei, DNA inside
of the nucleus must be copied or replicated. This occurs during the S
phase of the cell cycle. During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into
two complete sets, so that after **cytokinesis** , each cell has a
complete set of genetic instructions.

#### Chromosomes {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tZXM._18-kdr}

To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form
**chromosomes** . Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes. In
human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical **sister
chromatids** , forming an "X" shaped molecule ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wMy1jaHJvbW9zb21lcw..) ). The two
chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the **centromere** .
The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during
mitosis. The **spindles** separate sister chromatids from each other.

spindle microtubules attach during mitosis and meiosis. Notice that a

</div>

#### Four Phases of Mitosis {#3.html#x-ck12-Rm91ciBQaGFzZXMgb2YgTWl0b3Npcw.._18-l1v}

During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a
precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister
chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a
chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one
chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of "1/2 of
the X." Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of
each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase,
anaphase and telophase ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wNC1taXRvc2lzLWZsb3djaGFydA..) ).

1.  **Prophase** : The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses
    forming chromosomes. The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can
    see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called
    the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to
    chromosomes to help them move.
2.  **Metaphase** : The chromosomes line up in the center, or the
    equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top
    of the next.
3.  **Anaphase** : The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate
    as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of
    identical chromosomes.
4.  **Telophase** : The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form
    around the chromosomes in both cells.

An overview of the cell cycle and mitosis: during prophase the
chromosomes condense, during metaphase the chromosomes line up, during
anaphase the sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell,
and during telophase the nuclear envelope forms.

</div>

After telophase, each new nucleus contains the exact same number and
type of chromosomes as the original cell. The cell is now ready for
cytokinesis, which literally means "cell movement." During cytokinesis,
the cytoplasm divides and the parent cell separates, producing two
genetically identical cells, each with its own nucleus. A new cell
membrane forms and in plant cells, a cell wall forms as well. Below is a
representation of dividing plant cells ( **Figure**

**Do animals always have two parents?**

No, not all animals have two parents. When necessary, some animals can
be produced from just one parent. Some reptiles, such as this Komodo
dragon, have only one parent. The process of creating offspring from
just one individual is called asexual reproduction.

### Reproduction {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_19-swu}

Animals and other organisms cannot live forever. They must reproduce if
their species is to survive. But what does it mean to reproduce?
**Reproduction** is the ability to make the next generation, and it is
one of the basic characteristics of life. Two methods of reproduction
are:

1.  **Asexual reproduction** , the process of forming a new individual
    from a single parent.
2.  **Sexual reproduction** , the process of forming a new individual
    from two parents.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, but the result is
always the same: a new life begins.

#### Asexual Reproduction {#3.html#x-ck12-QXNleHVhbCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._19-ahz}

When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be
passed from both the mother and father to the child. Humans cannot
reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But
having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms,
including some insects, fish, and reptiles. These organisms can
reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring ("children") have a single
parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent. This is
very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a
prokaryotic, single-celled organism, must reproduce asexually.

The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and
does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The
disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a
mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through
asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the
offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause
problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that
causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that
causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit
the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.

Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include:

1.  Prokaryotic organisms, like bacteria. Bacteria reproduce through
    **binary fission** , where they grow and divide in half ( **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wNi1TdGVwcy1vZi1CaW5hcnktRmlzc2lvbg..) ).
    First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell
    then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the
    two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one
    identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to
    reproduce very rapidly.
2.  Flatworms, an invertebrate animal species. Flatworms divide in two,
    then each half regenerates into a new flatworm identical to the
    original, a process called **fragmentation** .
3.  Different types of insects, fish, and lizards. These organisms can
    reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis.
    **Parthenogenesis** happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into
    a new organism. The resulting organism has half the amount of
    genetic material of the parent. Parthenogenesis is common
    in honeybees. In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers,
    while the asexually produced eggs become drones.

#### Sexual Reproduction {#3.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._19-0wd}

During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved. Most animals are
**dioecious** , meaning there is a separate male and female sex, with
the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs. When a sperm and
egg meet during **fertilization** , a **zygote** , the first cell of a
new organism, is formed ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wOC1mZXJ0aWxpemF0aW9u) ). This process
combines the genetic material from both parents. The resulting organism
will be genetically unique. The zygote will divide by mitosis and grow
into the embryo.

**Figure 3.30**

During sexual reproduction, a sperm fertilizes an egg.

</div>

Let's explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually:

Animals often have **gonads** , organs that produce eggs or sperm. The
male gonads are the **testes** , and the female gonads are the
**ovaries** . Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs. Sperm and egg,
the two sex cells, are known as **gametes** , and can combine two
different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two
parents. Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a
regular body cell; they are **haploid** cells. In humans, gametes have
one set of 23 chromosomes. Gametes are produced through a special type
of cell division known as **meiosis** . Normal human cells have 46
chromosomes. They are **diploid** cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes
(23 pairs).

Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which
is called **external fertilization** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wOS1maXNoLWd1YXJkaW5nLWVnZ3M.) ).
These gametes will combine by chance. Animals that live on land
(reptiles, birds, and mammals) reproduce by **internal fertilization** .
Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the
female. Birds do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the
cloaca that they place close to another bird’s cloaca to deposit sperm.
Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a
moist or wet environment prior to external fertilization.

</div>

-   Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs
    are different from animals’ gonads. Plants that have flowers have
    their reproductive parts in the flower. The sperm is contained in
    the pollen, while the egg is contained in the ovary, deep within
    the flower. The sperm can reach the egg two different ways:

1.  In **self-pollination** , the egg is fertilized by the pollen of the
    same flower.
2.  In **cross-pollination** , sperm from the pollen of one flower
    fertilizes the egg of another flower. Like other types of sexual
    reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits.
    Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is carried by the wind to
    another flower. It can also occur when animal pollinators, like
    honeybees or butterflies ( **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xMC1jcm9zcy1wb2xsaW5hdGlvbg..) ),
    carry the pollen from flower to flower.

-   Fungi can also reproduce sexually, but instead of female and male
    sexes, they have (+) and (-) strains. When the filaments of a (+)
    and (-) fungi meet, the zygote is formed. Just like in plants and
    animals, each zygote receives DNA from two parent strains.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-lek}

-   Types of asexual reproduction, when a new individual is formed from
    a single parent, include binary fission in bacteria and
    parthenogenesis in some animals.
-   During sexual reproduction in animals, fertilization can be internal
    or external.
-   Cross-pollination allows sexual reproduction in plants.

**Do you have ALL your parents' chromosomes?**

No, you only received half of your mother's chromosomes and half of your
father's chromosomes. If you inherited them all, you would have twice
the number of chromosomes that you're supposed to have. Humans typically
have 23 pairs of chromosomes. If you received all your parents'
chromosomes, you would have 46 pairs!

### Introduction to Meiosis {#3.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIE1laW9zaXM._20-zd9}

**Sexual reproduction** combines gametes from two parents. **Gametes**
are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg. As gametes are produced,
the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half. Why? The **zygote**
must contain genetic information from the mother and from the father, so
the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes found in normal body
cells. When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal
amount of chromosomes results. Gametes are produced by a special type of
cell division known as **meiosis** . Meiosis contains two rounds of cell
division without DNA replication in between. This process reduces the
number of chromosomes by half.

Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a
pair is called a **homologous chromosome** . For each of the 23
chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one
chromosome from your mother. **Alleles** are alternate forms of genes
found on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, though
they may have different alleles. So, though homologous chromosomes are
very similar, they are not identical. The homologous chromosomes are
separated when gametes are formed. Therefore, gametes have only 23
chromosomes, not 23 pairs.

#### Haploid vs. Diploid {#3.html#x-ck12-SGFwbG9pZCB2cy4gRGlwbG9pZA.._20-6fr}

A cell with two sets of chromosomes is **diploid** , referred to as *2n*
, where *n* is the number of sets of chromosomes. Most of the cells in a
human body are diploid. A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a
gamete, is **haploid** , referred to as *n* . Sex cells are haploid.
When a haploid sperm ( *n* ) and a haploid egg ( *n* ) combine, a
diploid zygote will be formed ( *2n* ). In short, when a diploid zygote
is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent.

#### Overview of Meiosis {#3.html#x-ck12-T3ZlcnZpZXcgb2YgTWVpb3Npcw.._20-sin}

Before meiosis begins, DNA replication occurs, so each chromosome
contains two sister chromatids that are identical to the original
chromosome. Meiosis ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTE2LU92ZXJ2aWV3LW9mLW1laW9zaXM.) ) is
divided into two divisions: Meiosis I and Meiosis II. Each division can
be divided into the same phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and
telophase. Cytokinesis follows telophase each time. Between the two cell
divisions, DNA replication does not occur. Through this process, one
diploid cell will divide into four haploid cells.

**Figure 3.33**

Overview of Meiosis. During meiosis, four haploid cells are created from
one diploid parent cell.

</div>

#### Meiosis I {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVpb3NpcyBJ_20-l2n}

During meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are separated from
each other. This requires that they line up in their homologous paris
during metaphase I. The steps are outlined below:

1.  Prophase I: The homologous chromosomes line up together. During this
    time, a process that only happens in meiosis can occur. This process
    is called **crossing-over** ( **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xMS1jcm9zc2luZy1vdmVy) ), which is
    the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes. Crossing-over
    forms new combinations of alleles on the resulting chromosome.
    Without crossing-over, the offspring would always inherit all of the
    alleles on one of the homologous chromosomes. Also during prophase
    I, the **spindle** forms, the chromosomes condense as they coil up
    tightly, and the nuclear envelope disappears.
2.  Metaphase I: The homologous chromosomes line up in their pairs in
    the middle of the cell. Chromosomes from the mother or from the
    father can each attach to either side of the spindle. Their
    attachment is random, so all of the chromosomes from the mother or
    father do not end up in the same gamete. The gamete will contain
    some chromosomes from the mother and some chromosomes from
    the father.
3.  Anaphase I: The homologous chromosomes are separated as the spindle
    shortens, and begin to move to opposite sides (opposite poles) of
    the cell.
4.  Telophase I: The spindle fibers dissolves, but a new nuclear
    envelope does not need to form. This is because, after cytokinesis,
    the nucleus will immediately begin to divide again. No DNA
    replication occurs between meiosis I and meiosis II because the
    chromosomes are already duplicated. After cytokinesis, two haploid
    cells result, each with chromosomes made of sister chromatids.

Since the separation of chromosomes into gametes is random during
meiosis I, this process results in different combinations of chromosomes
(and alleles) in each gamete. With 23 pairs of chromosomes, there is a
possibility of over 8 million different combinations of chromosomes (2
^23^ ) in a human gamete.

**Figure 3.34**

During crossing-over, segments of DNA are exchanged between non-sister
chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Notice how this can result in an
allele (A) on one chromatid being moved onto the other non-sister
chromatid.

</div>

#### Meiosis II {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVpb3NpcyBJ_20SQ..-4qs}

During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes
are generated. This cell division is similar to that of **mitosis** ,
but results in four genetically unique haploid cells. The steps are
outlined below:

1.  Prophase II: The chromosomes condense.
2.  Metaphase II: The chromosomes line up one on top of each other along
    the middle of the cell, similar to how they line up in mitosis. The
    spindle is attached to the centromere of each chromosome.
3.  Anaphase II: The sister chromatids separate as the spindle shortens
    and move to opposite ends of the cell.
4.  Telophase II: A nuclear envelope forms around the chromosomes in all
    four cells. This is followed by cytokinesis.

After cytokinesis, each cell has divided again. Therefore, meiosis
results in four haploid genetically unique daughter cells, each with
half the DNA of the parent cell ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xMi1tZWlvc2lzLW92ZXJ2aWV3) ). In human
cells, the parent cell has 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), so the cells
produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. These cells will become
gametes.

**Mitosis or Meiosis?**

This represents a tiny embryo just beginning to form. Once an egg is
fertilized, the resulting single cell must divide many, many times to
develop a fetus. Both mitosis and meiosis involve cell division; is this
type of cell division an example of mitosis or meiosis? The answer is
mitosis. With each division you are making a genetically exact copy of
the parent cell, which only happens through mitosis.

Both **mitosis** and **meiosis** result in eukaryotic cells dividing. So
what is the difference between mitosis and meiosis? The primary
difference is the differing goals of each process. The goal of mitosis
is to produce two **daughter cells** that are genetically identical to
the parent cell, meaning the new cells have exactly the same DNA as the
parent cell. Mitosis happens when you want to grow, for example. You
want all your new cells to have the same DNA as the previous cells. The
goal of meiosis, however, is to produce sperm or eggs, also known as
**gametes** . The resulting gametes are not genetically identical to the
parent cell. Gametes are **haploid** cells, with only half the DNA
present in the **diploid** parent cell. This is necessary so that when a
sperm and an egg combine at **fertilization** , the resulting **zygote**
has the correct amount of DNA—not twice as much as the parents. The
zygote then begins to divide through mitosis.

Pictured below is a comparison between **binary fission** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xMy1iaWZpc3Npb24tbWl0b3Npcy1tZWlvc2lzLWNvbXBhcmU.)
), which is cell division of prokaryotic organisms, mitosis, and
meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are also compared in the table that follows

## Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-0hf}

The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living
organisms. But this smallest of units still performs some very complex
processes. In fact, for some organisms, just one cell must do everything
necessary for life.

Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from its
structure to its division. Some organisms contain just one cell, and
others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not.
Some have many organelles, others do not. But all cells are surrounded
by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that
determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and
for many organisms, this energy comes from the processes of
photosynthesis and cellular respiration. All cells come from preexisting
cells through the process of cell division, which can produce a new
prokaryotic organism. The cell cycle, which includes mitosis, defines
the life of the eukaryotic cell.

**Why is heredity so important?**

Genetics is the study of inheritance. Inheritance is the passing of
traits from parents to offspring. How are these traits "passed"? Through
DNA, which is the genetic material of all organisms. This concept will
focus on genetics, inheritance, and DNA.

**Where's the instructions?**

How do your cells know what to do? Just like builders have blueprints to
tell them how to build a house, your cells also have instructions. Your
cells' instructions are molecules of DNA.

### What is DNA? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBETkE_-g7a}

**DNA** is the material that makes up our chromosomes and stores our
genetic information. When you build a house, you need a blueprint, a set
of instructions that tells you how to build. The DNA is like the
blueprint for living organisms. The genetic information is a set of
instructions that tell your cells what to do.

DNA is an abbreviation for **deoxyribonucleic acid** . As you may
recall, **nucleic acids** are a type of macromolecule that store
information. The *deoxyribo* part of the name refers to the name of the
sugar that is contained in DNA, deoxyribose. DNA may provide the
instructions to make up all living things, but it is actually a very
simple molecule. DNA is made of a very long chain of nucleotides. In
fact, in you, the smallest DNA molecule has well over 20 million
nucleotides.

#### Nucleotides {#4.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVvdGlkZXM.-plz}

**Nucleotides** are composed of three main parts:

1.  a phosphate group.
2.  a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA).
3.  a nitrogen-containing base.

The only difference between each nucleotide is the identity of the base.
There are only four possible bases that make up each DNA nucleotide:
adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).

#### The Genetic Code {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdlbmV0aWMgQ29kZQ..-i1y}

The various sequences of the four nucleotide bases make up the genetic
code of your cells. It may seem strange that there are only four letters
in the “alphabet” of DNA. But since your **chromosomes** contain
millions of nucleotides, there are many, many different combinations
possible with those four letters.

But how do all these pieces fit together? James Watson and Francis Crick
won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for piecing together the structure of DNA.
Together with the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, they
determined that DNA is made of two strands of nucleotides formed into a
**double helix** , or a two-stranded spiral, with the sugar and
phosphate groups on the outside, and the paired bases connecting the two
strands on the inside of the helix ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xNC1kb3VibGUtaGVsaXg.) ).

![The double helix of
DNA](ck12_4_files/20150911113021259853.jpeg "The double helix of DNA")

**Figure 4.1**

DNA’s three-dimensional structure is a double helix. The hydrogen bonds
between the bases at the center of the helix hold the helix together.

</div>

#### Base-Pairing {#4.html#x-ck12-QmFzZS1QYWlyaW5n-z0q}

The bases in DNA do not pair randomly. When Erwin Chargaff looked
closely at the bases in DNA, he noticed that the percentage of adenine
(A) in the DNA always equaled the percentage of thymine (T), and the
percentage of guanine (G) always equaled the percentage of cytosine (C).
Watson and Crick’s model explained this result by suggesting that A
always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C in the DNA helix.
Therefore A and T, and G and C, are "complementary bases," or bases that
always pair together, known as a **base-pair** . The base-pairing rules
state that A will always bind to T, and G will always bind to C (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xNS1iYXNlLXBhaXJz) ). For
example, if one DNA strand reads ATGCCAGT, the other strand will be made
up of the complementary bases: TACGGTCA.

Hydrogen bonds hold the complementary bases together, with two bonds
forming between an A and a T, and three bonds between a G and a C.

**Does DNA copy itself?**

Yes, your DNA needs to copy itself every time a new cell is created. The
new cell needs to have DNA exactly like the rest of your cells.
Otherwise, that cell might malfunction. That's why it's important that
the process of copying DNA, called DNA replication, is very accurate.

### DNA Replication {#4.html#x-ck12-RE5BIFJlcGxpY2F0aW9u_1-bir}

DNA must replicate (copy) itself so that each resulting cell after
mitosis and cell division has the same DNA as the parent cell. All these
cells, the parent cell and the two new daughter cells, are genetically
identical.

**DNA replication** occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of
the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules
are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when
DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA.

The general steps involved in DNA replication are as follows:

1.  The DNA helix unwinds like a zipper as the bonds between the base
    pairs are broken. The enzyme DNA Helicase is involved in breaking
    these bonds.
2.  The two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a
    new stand to be created. Using DNA as a template means that on the
    new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the
    base pairing rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as
    are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new strand
    is created. If ATGCCA is on the "template strand," then TACGGT will
    be on the new DNA strand. The enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the
    template and builds the new strand of DNA.
3.  The new set of nucleotides then join together to form a new strand
    of DNA. The process results in two DNA molecules, each with one old
    strand and one new strand of DNA.

This process is known as **semiconservative replication** because one
strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xNi1kbmEtcmVwbGljYXRpb24.)
).

**Figure 4.3**

DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands “unzip,” and the original
strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form
a new strand.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-vdw}

-   During DNA replication, the DNA helix unwinds and the two single
    strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to
    be created.
-   DNA replication is semi-conservative: the new DNA molecule consists
    of half of the parent DNA molecule.

**How do you build a protein?**

Your body needs proteins to create muscles, regulate chemical reactions,
transport oxygen, and perform other important tasks in your body. But
how are these proteins built? They are made up of units called amino
acids. Just like there are only a few types of blocks in a set, there
are a limited number of amino acids. But there are many different ways
in which they can be combined.

### Introduction to Protein Synthesis {#4.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIFByb3RlaW4gU3ludGhlc2lz_2-zr5}

A monomer is a molecule that can bind to other monomers to form a
polymer. **Amino acids** are the monomers of a protein. The DNA sequence
contains the instructions to place amino acids into a specific order.

When the amino acid monomers are assembled in that specific order,
proteins are made, a process called **protein synthesis.** In short, DNA
contains the instructions to create proteins. But DNA does not directly
make the proteins. Proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm,
and DNA (in an eukaryotic cell) is in the nucleus. So the cell uses an
RNA intermediate to produce proteins.

Each strand of DNA has many separate sequences that code for a specific
protein. Insulin is an example of a protein made by your cells (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfTVNfTFNfaW5zdWxpbg..) ). Units
of DNA that contain code for the creation of a protein are called
**genes** .

#### Cells Can Turn Genes On or Off {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHMgQ2FuIFR1cm4gR2VuZXMgT24gb3IgT2Zm_2-fou}

There are about 22,000 genes in every human cell. Does every human cell
have the same genes? Yes. Does every human cell make the same proteins?
No. In a multicellular organism, such as us, cells have specific
functions because they have different proteins. They have different
proteins because different genes are expressed in different cell types
(which is known as **gene expression** ).

Imagine that all of your genes are "turned off." Each cell type only
"turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have the code for the proteins
it needs to use. So different cell types "turn on" different genes,
allowing different proteins to be made. This gives different cell types
different functions. 

Once a gene is expressed, the protein product of that gene is usually
made. For this reason, gene expression and protein synthesis are often
considered the same process.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-4rb}

-   DNA contains the instructions to assemble amino acids in a specific
    order to make protein.
-   Each cell type only "turns on" (or expresses) the genes that have
    the code for the proteins it needs to use.
-   Gene expression and protein synthesis are usually considered the
    same molecular process.

**How does your DNA send a message?**

DNA is the blueprint that provides the directions on how to build all
the proteins your body needs to function. However, DNA is confined to
the nucleus and, therefore, isn't involved directly in the process of
actually making the proteins. So how does DNA tell the rest of the cell
what to do? It sends a message! The messengers consist of a special type
of RNA.

### Three RNAs {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhyZWUgUk5Bcw.._3-ore}

DNA contains the instructions to create proteins, but it does not make
proteins itself. DNA is located in the nucleus, which it never leaves,
while proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytoplasm. So DNA needs a
messenger to bring its instructions to a ribosome located outside of the
nucleus. DNA sends out a message, in the form of **RNA** (ribonucleic
acid), describing how to make the protein.

There are three types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis:

-   Messenger RNA ( **mRNA** ) carries the instructions from the nucleus
    to the cytoplasm. mRNA is produced in the nucleus, as are all RNAs.
-   The other two forms of RNA, ribosomal RNA ( **rRNA** ) and transfer
    RNA ( **tRNA** ), are involved in the process of ordering the amino
    acids to make the protein. rRNA becomes part of the ribosome, which
    is the site of protein synthesis, and tRNA brings an amino acid to
    the ribosome so it can be added to a growing chain during
    protein synthesis. There are numerous tRNAs, as each tRNA is
    specific for an amino acid. The amino acid actually attaches to the
    tRNA during this process. More about RNAs will be discussed during
    the *Transcription* and *Translation* Concepts.

All three RNAs are nucleic acids, made of nucleotides, similar to DNA (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-RE5BdnNSTkE.) ). The RNA nucleotide is
different from the DNA nucleotide in the following ways:

-   RNA contains a different kind of sugar, called ribose.
-   In RNA, the base uracil (U) replaces the thymine (T) found in DNA.
-   RNA is a single strand molecule.

**How does DNA write its message?**

The process of DNA sending a message to the cytoplasm is called
transcription. Transcription means "a written copy." However, DNA can't
get out a pen and write a message. It creates an mRNA molecule to carry
the message.

### Transcription {#4.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNjcmlwdGlvbg.._4-mhb}

DNA is located in the nucleus. Proteins are made on ribosomes in the
cytoplasm. Remember that information in a **gene** is converted into
**mRNA** , which carries the information to the ribosome. In the
nucleus, mRNA is created by using the DNA in a gene as a template. A
**template** is a model provided for others to copy.

The process of constructing an mRNA molecule from DNA is known as
**transcription** ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xNy1PdmVydmlldy1vZi1UcmFuc2NyaXB0aW9u)
and **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xOC10cmFuc2NyaXB0aW9uLXVuemlw) ).
Transcription is similar to DNA replication, except in transcription,
single stranded RNA is produced instead of double stranded DNA. In
transcription, only one strand of DNA is used as a template. First, the
double helix of DNA unwinds and an enzyme, RNA Polymerase, builds the
mRNA using the DNA as a template. The nucleotides follow basically the
same base pairing rules as in DNA to form the correct sequence in the
mRNA. This time, however, uracil (U) pairs with each adenine (A) in the
DNA.

For example, a DNA sequence ACGGGTAAGG will be transcribed into the mRNA
sequence UGCCCAUUCC. In this manner, the information of the DNA is
passed on to the mRNA. The mRNA will carry this code to the ribosomes to
tell them how to make a protein.

As not all genes are used in every cell, a gene must be "turned on" or
expressed when the gene product is needed by the cell. Only the
information in a gene that is being expressed is transcribed into an
mRNA.

**How does the cell translate a message?**

The mRNA is the message sent from the nucleus to the ribosome, the
organelle of protein synthesis. Like a foreign language, the genetic
code of the mRNA message must then be translated so that the ribosomes
make the correct protein. The process of reading the code of a mRNA to
make a protein is called translation.

### Translation {#4.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNsYXRpb24._5-qau}

The mRNA, which is transcribed from the DNA in the nucleus, carries the
directions for the protein-making process. mRNA tells the **ribosome** (
**Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0xOS1yaWJvc29tZS10cmFuc2xhdGlvbg..) )
how to create a specific protein.

is called **translation** ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0yMC1nZW5lLWV4cHJlc3Npb24.) ): the mRNA
is translated from the language of nucleic acids (nucleotides) to the
language of proteins (amino acids). Sets of three bases, called
**codons** , are read in the ribosome, the organelle responsible for
making proteins.

**Figure 4.9**

This summary of how genes are expressed shows that DNA is transcribed
into RNA, which is translated, in turn, to protein. The one letter code
represents amino acids.

</div>

The following are the steps involved in translation:

-   mRNA travels to the ribosome from the nucleus.

The following steps occur in the ribosome:

-   The base code in the mRNA determines the order of the amino acids in
    the protein. The genetic code in mRNA is read in “words” of three
    letters (triplets), called codons. Each codon codes for an
    amino acid. There are 20 amino acids used to make proteins, and
    different codons code for different amino acids. For example, GGU
    codes for the amino acid glycine, while GUC codes for valine.
-   tRNA reads the mRNA code and brings a specific amino acid to attach
    to the growing chain of amino acids. The **anticodon** on the tRNA
    binds to the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA carries only one type of
    amino acid and only recognizes one specific codon. For example, a
    GGC anticodon will bind to a CCG codon,  and a CGA anticodon will
    bind to a GCU codon.
-   tRNA is released from the amino acid.
-   Three codons, UGA, UAA, and UAG, indicate that the protein should
    stop adding amino acids. They are called **stop codons** and do not
    code for an amino acid. Once tRNA comes to a stop codon, the protein
    is set free from the ribosome.

The following chart ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0yMS1nZW5ldGljLWNvZGU.) ) is used to
determine which amino acids correspond to which codons.

This chart shows the genetic code used by all organisms. For example, an
RNA codon reading GUU would encode for a valine (Val) according to this
chart. Start at the center for the first base of the three base codon,
and work your way out. Notice that more than one codon may encode for a
single amino acid. For example, glycine (Gly) is encoded by a GGG, GGA,
GGC, and GGU. Notice there are 64 codons. Of the 64 codons, three are
stop codons.

**Would a mutation make you a superhero?**

In the comic books, a mutation can give a person superpowers. Do you
think this really happens? In real life, a mutation can be beneficial,
or it can harm an organism. For example, beneficial mutations lead to
evolution, and harmful mutations can lead to diseases like cancer. A
mutation, however, is not going to turn you into a superhero!

### Mutations {#4.html#x-ck12-TXV0YXRpb25z_6-7ys}

The process of DNA replication is not always 100% accurate. Sometimes
the wrong base is inserted in the new strand of DNA. This wrong base
could become permanent. A permanent change in the sequence of DNA is
known as a **mutation** . Small changes in the DNA sequence are usually
**point mutations** , which is a change in a single nucleotide. Once DNA
has a mutation, that mutation will be copied each time the DNA
replicates. After cell division, each resulting cell will carry the
mutation.

A mutation may have no effect. However, sometimes a mutation can cause a
protein to be made incorrectly. A defect in the protein can affect how
well the protein works, or whether it works at all. Usually the loss of
a protein function is detrimental to the organism.

In rare circumstances, though, the mutation can be beneficial. Mutations
are a mechanism for how species evolve. For example, suppose a mutation
in an animal’s DNA causes the loss of an enzyme that makes a dark
pigment in the animal’s skin. If the population of animals has moved to
a light colored environment, the animals with the mutant gene would have
a lighter skin color and be better camouflaged. So in this case, the
mutation is beneficial.

#### Point Mutations {#4.html#x-ck12-UG9pbnQgTXV0YXRpb25z_6-si9}

If a single base is deleted (called a deletion, which is also a point
mutation), there can be huge effects on the organism, because this may
cause a **frameshift mutation** . Remember that the bases in the mRNA
are read in groups of three by the tRNA. If the reading frame is off by
even one base, the resulting sequence will consist of an entirely
different set of codons.

The reading of an mRNA is like reading three-letter words of a sentence.
Imagine the sentence: “The big dog ate the red cat.” If you take out the
second letter from "big," the frame will be shifted so now it will read:
“The bgd oga tet her edc at.” One single deletion makes the whole
“sentence” impossible to read. A point mutation that adds a base (known
as an insertion) would also result in a frameshift.

#### Chromosomal Mutations {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tYWwgTXV0YXRpb25z_6-fie}

Mutations may also occur in chromosomes ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfbXV0YXRpb25zLnBuZw..) ). These mutations
are going to be fairly large mutations, possible affecting many genes.
Possible types of mutations in chromosomes include:

1.  Deletion: When a segment of DNA is lost, so there is a missing
    segment in the chromosome. These usually result in many genes
    missing from the chromosome.
2.  Duplication: When a segment of DNA is repeated, creating a
    longer chromosome. These usually result in multiple copies of genes
    in the chromosome.
3.  Inversion: When a segment of DNA is flipped and then reattached to
    the same chromosome.
4.  Insertion: When a segment of DNA from one chromosome is added to
    another, unrelated chromosome.
5.  Translocation: When two segments from different chromosomes
    change positions.

#### Causes of Mutations {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIE11dGF0aW9ucw.._6-5lm}

Many mutations are not caused by errors in replication. Mutations can
happen spontaneously, and they can be caused by **mutagens** in the
environment. Some chemicals, such as those found in tobacco smoke, can
be mutagens. Sometimes mutagens can also cause cancer. Tobacco smoke,

-   A mutation is a permanent change in the sequence of bases in DNA.
-   Mutations occur in the DNA through deletion, duplication, inversion,
    insertion, and translocation within the chromosome.
-   Mutations can occur due to errors during DNA replication or by
    mutagens in the environment.

**Why do you look like your family?**

For a long time people understood that traits are passed down through
families. The rules of how this worked were unclear, however. The work
of Gregor Mendel was crucial in explaining how traits are passed down to
each generation.

### Mendel's Experiments {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVsJ3MgRXhwZXJpbWVudHM._7-ea1}

What does the word "inherit" mean? You may have inherited something of
value from a grandparent or another family member. To **inherit** is to
receive something from someone who came before you. You can inherit
objects, but you can also inherit traits. For example, you can inherit a
parent's eye color, hair color, or even the shape of your nose and ears!

**Genetics** is the study of inheritance. The field of genetics seeks to
explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next.

In the late 1850s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wMS1tZW5kZWw.) ) performed the first
genetics experiments.

To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they
have easily identifiable traits ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wMi1NZW5kZWwtc2V2ZW4tY2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNz)
). For example, pea plants are either tall or short, which is an easy
trait to observe. Furthermore, pea plants grow quickly, so he could
complete many experiments in a short period of time.

**Figure 4.13**

Characteristics of pea plants.

</div>

Mendel also used pea plants because they can either **self-pollinate**
or be **cross-pollinated** . Self-pollination means that only one flower
is involved; the flower's own pollen lands on the female sex organs.
Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to
the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally). As a result, one
plant's sex cells combine with another plant's sex cells. This is called
a "cross." These crosses produce **offspring** (or "children"), just
like when male and female animals mate. Since Mendel could move pollen
between plants, he could carefully control and then observe the results
of crosses between two different types of plants.

He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas,
including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds, white flowers versus purple
flowers, and tall plants versus short plants. Because of his work,
Mendel is considered the "Father of Genetics."

#### Mendel's First Experiment {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVsJ3MgRmlyc3QgRXhwZXJpbWVudA.._7-c58}

In one of Mendel's early experiments, he crossed a short plant and a
tall plant. What do you predict the offspring of these plants were?
Medium-sized plants? Most people during Mendel's time would have said
medium-sized. But an unexpected result occurred. Mendel observed that
the offspring of this cross (called the **F1 generation** ) were all
tall plants!

Next, Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate. That means the tall
plant offspring were crossed with each other. He found that 75% of their
offspring (the **F2 generation** ) were tall, while 25% were short.
Shortness skipped a generation. But why? In all, Mendel studied seven
characteristics, with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed. All of his
results were similar to the first experiment—about three out of every
four plants had one trait, while just one out of every four plants had
the other.

For example, he crossed purple flowered-plants and white
flowered-plants. Do you think the colors blended? No, they did not. Just
like the previous experiment, all offspring in this cross (the F1
generation) were one color: purple. In the F2 generation, 75% of plants
had purple flowers and 25% had white flowers ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wMy1NZW5kZWwtZmlyc3QtZXhwZXJpbWVudA..)
). There was no blending of traits in any of Mendel's experiments.

**What does it mean to be dominant?**

The most powerful or influential individual in a group is sometimes
called dominant. In genetics, a dominant trait means nearly the same
thing. A dominant trait is the most influential trait and masks the
other trait.

### Dominance {#4.html#x-ck12-RG9taW5hbmNl_8-d5w}

Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple flowered-plants
and white flowered-plants? All the offspring had purple flowers. There
was no blending of traits in any of Mendel's experiments. Mendel had to
come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results. He
developed a theory called the **law of segregation** .

#### The Law of Segregation {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExhdyBvZiBTZWdyZWdhdGlvbg.._8-xcr}

Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each
trait. There were two possibilities for each hereditary factor, such as
a purple factor or white factor. One factor is **dominant** to the
other. The other trait that is masked is called the **recessive**
factor, meaning that when both factors are present, only the effects of
the dominant factor are noticeable ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfcHVycGxl) ). Although you have two
hereditary factors for each trait, each parent can only pass on one of
these factors to the offspring. When the sex cells, or **gametes**
(sperm or egg), form, the heredity factors must separate, so there is
only one factor per gamete. In other words, the factors are "segregated"
in each gamete. Mendel's law of segregation states that the two
hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed. When fertilization
occurs, the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete, so
the resulting offspring have two factors.

The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis. Mendel
developed his theories without an understanding of DNA, or even the
knowledge that DNA existed. Quite a remarkable feat!

![Purple flowers are dominant to white in pea
plants](ck12_4_files/20150911113026626854.jpeg "Purple flowers are dominant to white in pea plants")

**Figure 4.15**

In peas, purple flowers are dominant to white. If one of these purple
flowers is crossed with a white flower, all the offspring will have
purple flowers.

</div>

#### Example Cross {#4.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZSBDcm9zcw.._8-z4m}

This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall
plant was crossed with a short plant. The two heredity factors in this
case were the short and tall factors. Each individual in the F1 would
have one of each factor, and as the tall factor is dominant to the short
factor (the recessive factor), all the plants appeared tall.

In describing genetic crosses, letters are used. The dominant factor is
represented with a capital letter ( *T* for tall) while the recessive
factor is represented by a lowercase letter ( *t* ). For the *T* and *t*
factors, three combinations are possible: *TT* , *Tt* , and *tt* . *TT*
plants will be tall, while plants with *tt* will be short. Since *T* is
dominant to *t* , plants that are *Tt* will be tall because the dominant
factor masks the recessive factor.

In this example, we are crossing a *TT* tall plant with a *tt* short
plant. As each parent gives one factor to the F1 generation, all of the
F1 generation will be *Tt* tall plants.

When the F1 generation ( *Tt* ) is allowed to self-pollinate, each
parent will give one factor ( *T* or *t* ) to the F2 generation. So the
F2 offspring will have four possible combinations of factors: *TT* ,
*Tt* , *tT* , or *tt* . According to the laws of probability, 25% of the
offspring would be *tt* , so they would appear short. And 75% would have
at least one *T* factor and would be tall.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-njv}

-   One hereditary factor is dominant to the other. The dominant trait
    masks the recessive factor, so that when both factors are present,
    only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable.
-   According to Mendel's law of segregation, there are two hereditary
    factors for each trait that must segregate during gamete (egg
    and sperm) production. As a result, offspring receive one factor
    from each parent, resulting in two factors for each trait in
    the offspring.

**What's the chance of the coin landing on heads?**

There is always a 50-50 chance that a coin will land on heads. Half the
time it will land on heads and half the time it will land on tails. What
is the chance of it landing heads twice in a row? Or three times? These
rules of probability also apply to genetics.

A parent only gives one factor for each trait to an offspring. If a
parent has one dominant and one recessive factor for a trait, then, on
average, half the time the dominant factor will be passed on, and half
the time the recessive factor will be passed on. 

### Probability and Punnett Squares {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmFiaWxpdHkgYW5kIFB1bm5ldHQgU3F1YXJlcw.._9-ios}

A **Punnett square** is a special tool derived from the laws of
probability. It is used to predict the possible offspring from a cross,
or mating between two parents.

An example of a Punnett square ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wMy1wdW5uZXR0LXNxdWFyZQ..) ) shows the
results of a cross between two purple flowers that each have one
dominant factor and one recessive factor ( *Bb* ).

**Figure 4.16**

The Punnett square of a cross between two purple flowers ( *Bb* ). A
Punnett square can be used to calculate what percentage of offspring
will have a certain trait.

</div>

To create a Punnett square, perform the following steps:

1.  Take the factors from the first parent and place them at the top of
    the square ( *B* and *b* ).
2.  Take the factors from the second parent and line them up on the left
    side of the square ( *B* and *b* ).
3.  Pull the factors from the top into the boxes below.
4.  Pull the factors from the side into the boxes next to them.

The possible offspring are represented by the letters in the boxes, with
one factor coming from each parent.

Results:

-   Top left box: *BB* , or purple flowers
-   Top right box: *Bb* , or purple flowers
-   Lower left box: *Bb* , or purple flowers
-   Lower right box: *bb* , or white flowers

Only one of the plants out of the four, or 25% of the plants, has white
flowers ( *bb* ). The other 75% have purple flowers ( *BB* , *Bb* ),
because the purple factor ( *B* ) is the dominant factor. This shows
that the color purple is the **dominant trait** in pea plants.

Now imagine you cross one of the white flowers ( *bb* ) with a purple
flower that has both a dominant and recessive factor ( *Bb* ). The only
possible gamete in the white flower is recessive ( *b* ), while the
purple flower can have gametes with either dominant ( *B* ) or recessive
( *b* ).

Practice using a Punnett square with this cross (see **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlLVB1bm5ldHQtU3F1YXJlLWRlZmluZWQ.) ).

                           **b**                    **b**
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
  **B**                    **Bb**                   **Bb**
  **b**                    **bb**                   **bb**

Did you find that 50% of the offspring will be purple, and 50% of the
offspring will be white?

**Did Mendel know about DNA?**

No, people did not understand that DNA is our hereditary material until
long after Mendel's time. Our modern understanding of DNA and
chromosomes helped to explain how Mendel's rules worked.

### Modern Genetics {#4.html#x-ck12-TW9kZXJuIEdlbmV0aWNz_10-l4t}

Mendel laid the foundation for modern genetics, but there were still a
lot of questions he left unanswered. What exactly are the dominant and
recessive factors that determine how all organisms look? And how do
these factors work?

Since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered the answers to these
questions. Genetic material is made out of **DNA** . It is the DNA that
makes up the hereditary factors that Mendel identified. By applying our
modern knowledge of DNA and chromosomes, we can explain Mendel’s
findings and build on them. In this concept, we will explore the
connections between Mendel’s work and modern genetics.

#### Traits, Genes, and Alleles {#4.html#x-ck12-VHJhaXRzLCBHZW5lcywgYW5kIEFsbGVsZXM._10-uvl}

Recall that our DNA is wound into **chromosomes** . Each of our
chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that encodes hundreds, if not
thousands, of genes. Each of these genes can have slightly different
versions from individual to individual. These variants of genes are
called **alleles** . Each parent only donates one allele for each gene
to an offspring.

For example, remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are
two possible factors. These factors are alleles. There is a dominant
allele for tallness *(T)* and a recessive allele for shortness *(t)* .

#### Genotype and Phenotype {#4.html#x-ck12-R2Vub3R5cGUgYW5kIFBoZW5vdHlwZQ.._10-21w}

**Genotype** is a way to describe the combination of alleles that an
individual has for a certain gene ( **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-R2Vub3R5cGVz) ). For each gene, an organism has
two alleles, one on each chromosome of a homologous pair of chromosomes
(think of it as one allele from Mom, one allele from Dad). The genotype
is represented by letter combinations, such as *TT* , *Tt* , and *tt* .

When an organism has two of the same alleles for a specific gene, it is
**homozygous** ( *homo* means "same") for that gene. An organism can be
either homozygous dominant *(TT)* or homozygous recessive *(tt).* If an
organism has two different alleles *(Tt)* for a certain gene, it is
known as **heterozygous** ( *hetero* means different).

  **Genotype**           **Definition**                                 **Example**
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------- --------------
  Homozygous             Two of the same allele                         *TT* or *tt*
  Heterozygous           One dominant allele and one recessive allele   *Tt*
  Homozygous dominant    Two dominant alleles                           *TT*
  Homozygous recessive   Two recessive alleles                          *tt*

**Phenotype** is a way to describe the traits you can see. The genotype
is like a recipe for a cake, while the phenotype is like the cake made
from the recipe. The genotype expresses the phenotype. For example, the
phenotypes of Mendel’s pea plants were either tall or short, or they
were purple-flowered or white-flowered.

Can organisms with different genotypes have the same phenotypes? Let’s
see.

What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is homozygous dominant *(TT)*
for the tall trait? Tall. What is the phenotype of a pea plant that is
heterozygous *(Tt)?* It is also tall. The answer is yes, two different
genotypes can result in the same phenotype. Remember, the recessive
phenotype will be expressed only when the dominant allele is absent, or
when an individual is homozygous recessive *(tt)* ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wNC1nZW5vdHlwZS12cy1waGVub3R5cGU.) ).

**How would Mendel explain blood types?**

The inheritance of traits is not always as simple as Mendel's rules.
Each characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that
had only two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant over
the other. We now know that inheritance is often more complicated than
this. In blood types, for example, there are actually three alleles
instead of two. And some traits even have more than three alleles.

### Exceptions to Mendel's Rules {#4.html#x-ck12-RXhjZXB0aW9ucyB0byBNZW5kZWwncyBSdWxlcw.._11-yx2}

In all of Mendel’s experiments, he worked with traits where a single
gene controlled the trait. Each also had one allele that was always
dominant over the recessive allele. But this is not always true.

There are exceptions to Mendel’s rules, and these exceptions usually
have something to do with the dominant allele. If you cross a homozygous
red flower with a homozygous white flower, according to Mendel's laws,
what color flower should result from the cross? Either a completely red
or completely white flower, depending on which allele is dominant. But
since Mendel's time, scientists have discovered this is not always the
case.

#### Incomplete Dominance {#4.html#x-ck12-SW5jb21wbGV0ZSBEb21pbmFuY2U._11-npb}

One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele.
Sometimes an individual has a phenotype between the two parents because
one allele is not dominant over another. This pattern of inheritance is
called **incomplete dominance** . For example, snapdragon flowers show
incomplete dominance. One of the genes for flower color in snapdragons
has two alleles, one for red flowers and one for white flowers.

A plant that is homozygous for the red allele ( *RR* ) will have red
flowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the white allele will have
white flowers ( *WW* ). But the heterozygote will have pink flowers (
*RW* ) ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wNS1pbmNvbXBsZXRlLWRvbWluYW5jZQ..) )
as both alleles are expressed. Neither the red nor the white allele is
dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend of the two
parents.

**Figure 4.18**

Pink snapdragons are an example of incomplete dominance.

</div>

Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a
disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced
incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape,
making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the
smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( *ss* )
for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the
incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( *SS* ) will
have normal red blood cells.

What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous (
*Ss* ) for the trait will have? They will have some misshapen cells and
some normal cells ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wNi1zaWNrbGUtdmVyc3VzLW5vcm1hbC1jZWxscw..)
). Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the result
is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant
traits.

Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and curved
unlike normal, rounded red blood cells.

</div>

#### Codominance {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29kb21pbmFuY2U._11-fyu}

Another exception to Mendel's laws is a phenomenon called
**codominance** . For example, our blood type shows codominance. Do you
know what your blood type is? Are you A? O? AB? Those letters actually
represent alleles. Unlike other traits, your blood type has three
alleles, instead of two!

The ABO blood types ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wNy1BQk8tYmxvb2QtdHlwZXM.) ) are named
for the protein attached to the outside of the blood cell. In this case,
two alleles are dominant and completely expressed *(I ^A^ and I ^B^ ),*
while one allele is recessive *(i).* The *I ^A^* allele encodes for red
blood cells with the A antigen, while the *I ^B^* allele encodes for red
blood cells with the B antigen. The recessive allele *(i)* does not
encode for any proteins. Therefore a person with two recessive alleles
*(ii)* has type O blood. As no dominant *(I ^A^ and I ^B^ )* allele is
present, the person cannot have type A or type B blood. What are the
genotypes of a person with type A or type B blood?

**Figure 4.20**

An example of codominant inheritance is ABO blood types.

</div>

There are two possible genotypes for type A blood, homozygous ( *I ^A^ I
^A^* ) and heterozygous ( *I ^A^ i* ), and two possible genotypes for
type B blood, ( *I ^B^ I ^B^* and *I ^B^ i* ). If a person is
heterozygous for both the *I ^A^* and *I ^B^* alleles, they will express
both and have type AB blood with both proteins on each red blood cell.

This pattern of inheritance is significantly different than Mendel’s
rules for inheritance, because both alleles are expressed completely,
and one does not mask the other.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-4im}

-   Incomplete dominance, as seen in sickle cell anemia, is a form of
    inheritance in which one allele is only partly dominant over the
    other allele, resulting in an intermediate phenotype.
-   Codominance, as in human blood type, is a form of inheritance in
    which both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype of
    the heterozygote.

**Are all people either short or tall?**

Unlike Mendel's peas, people do not all fall into two categories: short
or tall. Most people, in fact, are somewhere in between. Obviously,
Mendel's rules are too simple to explain the inheritance of human
height.

### Polygenic Traits {#4.html#x-ck12-UG9seWdlbmljIFRyYWl0cw.._12-10p}

Another exception to Mendel’s rules is **polygenic inheritance** , which
occurs when a trait is controlled by more than one gene. This means that
each dominant allele "adds" to the expression of the next dominant
allele.

Usually, traits are polygenic when there is wide variation in the trait.
For example, humans can be many different sizes. Height is a polygenic
trait, controlled by at least three genes with six alleles. If you are
dominant for all of the alleles for height, then you will be very tall.
There is also a wide range of skin color across people. Skin color is
also a polygenic trait, as are hair and eye color.

Polygenic inheritance often results in a bell shaped curve when you
analyze the population ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wOC1wb2x5Z2VuaWMtdHJhaXRz) ). That
means that most people fall in the middle of the phenotypic range, such
as average height, while very few people are at the extremes, such as
very tall or very short. At one end of the curve will be individuals who
are recessive for all the alleles (for example, *aabbcc* ); at the other
end will be individuals who are dominant for all the alleles (for
example, *AABBCC* ). Through the middle of the curve will be individuals
who have a combination of dominant and recessive alleles (for example,
*AaBbCc* or *AaBBcc* ).

**Figure 4.21**

Polygenic traits tend to result in a distribution that resembles a
bell-shaped curve, with few at the extremes and most in the middle.
There may be 4 or 6 or more alleles involved in the phenotype. At the
left extreme, individuals are completely dominant for all alleles, and
at the right extreme, individuals are completely recessive for all
alleles. Individuals in the middle have various combinations of
recessive and dominant alleles.

**Male or female?**

One of the exciting things about expecting a child is wondering if the
baby will be a boy or a girl. There are many superstitions about how one
might influence or predict the outcome. But what really determines if a
baby is male or female? We now know that the gender of a baby is
determined by a special pair of chromosomes known as the sex
chromosomes.

### Sex-linked Inheritance {#4.html#x-ck12-U2V4LWxpbmtlZCBJbmhlcml0YW5jZQ.._13-apb}

What determines if a baby is a male or female? Recall that you have 23
pairs of chromosomes—and one of those pairs is the **sex chromosomes** .
Everyone has two sex chromosomes. Your sex chromosomes can be X or Y.
Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X chromosome
and one Y chromosome (XY).

If a baby inherits an X chromosome from the father and an X chromosome
from the mother, what will be the child’s sex? The baby will have two X
chromosomes, so it will be female. If the father’s sperm carries the Y
chromosome, the child will be male. Notice that a mother can only pass
on an X chromosome, so the sex of the baby is determined by the father.
The father has a 50 percent chance of passing on the Y or X chromosome,
so there is a 50 percent chance that a child will be male, and there is
a 50 percent chance a child will be female. This 50:50 chance occurs for
each baby. A couple's first five children could all be boys. The sixth
child still has a 50:50 chance of being a girl.

One special pattern of inheritance that doesn’t fit Mendel’s rules is
**sex-linked inheritance** , referring to the inheritance of traits that
are located on genes on the sex chromosomes. Since males and females do
not have the same sex chromosomes, there will be differences between the
sexes in how these **sex-linked traits** —traits linked to genes located
on the sex chromosomes—are expressed. Sex-linked traits usually refer to
traits due to genes on the X chromosome.

One example of a sex-linked trait is red-green colorblindness. People
with this type of colorblindness cannot tell the difference between red
and green. They often see these colors as shades of brown ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0wOS1jb2xvci1ibGluZG5lc3M.) ). Boys are
much more likely to be colorblind than girls ( **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Y29sb3ItYmxpbmRuZXNzLXB1bm5ldHQ.) ). This is
because colorblindness is a sex-linked, recessive trait.

Boys only have one X chromosome, so if that chromosome carries the gene
for colorblindness, they will be colorblind. As girls have two X
chromosomes, a girl can have one X chromosome with the colorblind gene
and one X chromosome with a normal gene for color vision. Since
colorblindness is recessive, the dominant normal gene will mask the
recessive colorblind gene. Females with one colorblindness allele and
one normal allele are referred to as **carriers** . They carry the
allele but do not express it.

How would a female become colorblind? She would have to inherit two
genes for colorblindness, which is very unlikely. Many sex-linked traits
are inherited in a recessive manner.

**When is a cold not just a cold?**

At some point in your life, you're bound to catch a cold. And there are
ways to prevent catching a cold. But what if you couldn't prevent an
illness? What if you were born with a disease? What if having a disease
was actually due to your DNA? These are genetic diseases, and they can
be very serious.

### Human Genetic Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gR2VuZXRpYyBEaXNvcmRlcnM._14-v1p}

Many **genetic disorders** are caused by mutations in one or a few
genes. Others are caused by chromosomal mutations. Some human genetic
disorders are X-linked or Y-linked, which means the faulty gene is
carried on these sex chromosomes. Other genetic disorders are carried on
one of the other 22 pairs of chromosomes; these chromosomes are known as
**autosomes** or autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes. Some genetic disorders
are due to new mutations, others can be inherited from your parents.

#### Autosomal Recessive Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-QXV0b3NvbWFsIFJlY2Vzc2l2ZSBEaXNvcmRlcnM._14-o9v}

Some genetic disorders are caused by recessive alleles of a single gene
on an autosome. An example of  **autosomal recessive genetic disorders**
 are Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. Children with **cystic
fibrosis** have excessively thick mucus in their lungs, which makes it
difficult for them to breathe. The inheritance of this recessive allele
is the same as any other recessive allele, so a Punnett square can be
used to predict the probability that two **carriers** of the disease
will have a child with cystic fibrosis. Recall that carriers have the
recessive allele for a trait but do not express the trait. What are the
possible genotypes of the offspring in the following table ( **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Y3lzdGljLWZpYnJvc2lzLXB1bm5ldHQ.) )? What
are the possible phenotypes?

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
|                          | **F**                    | **f**                    |
+==========================+==========================+==========================+
| **F**                    | **FF**                   | **Ff**                   |
|                          |                          |                          |
|                          | (normal)                 | (carrier)                |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| **f**                    | **Ff**                   | **ff**                   |
|                          |                          |                          |
|                          | (carrier)                | (affected)               |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

According to this Punnett square, two parents that are carriers ( *Ff* )
of the cystic fibrosis gene have a 25% chance of having a child with
cystic fibrosis ( *ff* ). The affected child must inherit two recessive
alleles. The carrier parents are not affected.

**Tay-Sachs** disease is a severe genetic disorder in which affected
children do not live to adulthood, so the gene is not passed from an
affected individual. Carriers of the Tay-Sachs gene are not affected.
How does a child become affected with Tay-Sachs?

#### Automsomal Dominant Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-QXV0b21zb21hbCBEb21pbmFudCBEaXNvcmRlcnM._14-sa5}

**Huntington’s disease** is an example of an **autosomal dominant
disorder** . This means that if the dominant allele is present, then the
person will express the disease. A child only has to inherit one
dominant allele to have the disease.

The disease causes the brain’s cells to break down, leading to muscle
spasms and personality changes. Unlike most other genetic disorders, the
symptoms usually do not become apparent until middle age. You can use a
simple Punnett square to predict the inheritance of a dominant autosomal
disorder, like Huntington’s disease. If one parent has Huntington’s
disease, what is the chance of passing it on to the children? If you
draw the Punnett square, you will find that there is a 50 percent chance
of the disorder being passed on to the children.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-ihe}

-   Autosomal recessive genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, are
    caused by recessive alleles of a single gene on an autosome.
-   Autosomal dominant genetic disorders, such as Huntington's disease,
    are caused by dominant alleles of a single gene on an autosome.

**What's a pedigree?**

When you are talking about a pedigree dog, it means the dog is purebred.
Through selective breeding, the dog has all the traits of that
particular breed. When talking about genetics, however, a pedigree is a
chart that helps show family relationships.

### Pedigree Analysis {#4.html#x-ck12-UGVkaWdyZWUgQW5hbHlzaXM._15-6cv}

A **pedigree** is a chart that shows the inheritance of a trait over
several generations. A pedigree is commonly created for families, and it
outlines the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders and traits. A
pedigree can help predict the probability that offspring will inherit a
genetic disorder.

Pictured below is a pedigree displaying recessive inheritance of a
disorder through three generations ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xMC1wZWRpZ3JlZQ..) ). From studying a
pedigree, scientists can determine the following:

-   If the trait is **sex-linked** (on the X or Y chromosome) or
    **autosomal** (on a chromosome that does not determine sex).
-   If the trait is inherited in a dominant or recessive fashion.

Sometimes pedigrees can also help determine whether individuals with the
trait are heterozygous (two different alleles) or homozygous (two of the
same allele). Some points to keep in mind when analyzing a pedigree are:

1.  With autosomal recessive inheritance, all affected individuals will
    be homozygous recessive.
2.  With dominant inheritance, all affected individuals will have at
    least one dominant allele. They will be either homozygous dominant
    or heterozygous.
3.  With sex-linked inheritance, more males (XY) than females (XX)
    usually have the trait. Sex-linked inheritance is usually
    recessive.

In a pedigree, squares symbolize males, and circles represent females. A
horizontal line joining a male and female indicates that the couple had
offspring. Vertical lines indicate offspring which are listed left to
right, in order of birth. Shading of the circle or square indicates an
individual who has the trait being traced. In this pedigree, the
inheritance of the recessive trait is being traced. *A* is the dominant
allele, and *a* is the recessive allele.

**Can you have too many chromosomes?**

Yes, it's not a good thing to have extra chromosomes. An extra
chromosome can be fatal to an embryo, in fact. In the case of a few
chromosomes, however, a baby may be born with an extra chromosome. This
child will have a chromosomal disorder.

### Chromosomal Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tYWwgRGlzb3JkZXJz_16-ulq}

Some children are born with genetic defects that are not carried by a
single gene. Instead, an error in a larger part of the chromosome or
even in an entire chromosome causes the disorder. Usually the error
happens when the egg or sperm is forming. Having extra chromosomes or
damaged chromosomes can cause disorders.

#### Extra Chromosomes {#4.html#x-ck12-RXh0cmEgQ2hyb21vc29tZXM._16-1n5}

One common example of an extra-chromosome disorder is **Down syndrome**
( **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xMS1kb3duLXN5bmRyb21l) ).
Children with Down syndrome are mentally disabled and also have physical
deformities. Down syndrome occurs when a baby receives an extra
chromosome 21 from one of his or her parents. Usually, a child will
receive one chromosome 21 from the mother and one chromosome 21 from the
father. In an individual with Down syndrome, however, there are three
copies of chromosome 21 ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xMi1Eb3duLVN5bmRyb21lLUthcnlvdHlwZQ..)
). Therefore, Down syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21. These people
have 47 total chromosomes.

**Figure 4.25**

</div>

Another example of a chromosomal disorder is **Klinefelter syndrome** ,
in which a male inherits an extra “X” chromosome. These individuals have
an XXY genotype. They have underdeveloped sex organs and elongated
limbs. They also have difficulty learning new things.

Outside of chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes, most embryos with
extra chromosomes do not usually survive. Because chromosomes carry
many, many genes, a disruption of a chromosome can cause severe problems
with the development of a fetus. Individuals with one (or more) fewer
chromosome usually don't survive either. Can you explain why?

#### Damaged Chromosomes {#4.html#x-ck12-RGFtYWdlZCBDaHJvbW9zb21lcw.._16-9cf}

Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes
damaged. For example, if a tiny portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the
individual will have *cri du chat* (cat’s cry) syndrome. These
individuals have misshapen facial features, and the infant’s cry
resembles a cat’s cry.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-r8b}

-   Changes in chromosome number can lead to disorders like
    Down syndrome.
-   Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome

**Can we alter DNA?**

You might think that DNA is stable and unchangeable. For the most part
you are right. However, there are new technologies that allow us to
alter the DNA of humans and other organisms.

### Recombinant DNA {#4.html#x-ck12-UmVjb21iaW5hbnQgRE5B_17-vhw}

**Recombinant DNA** is the combination of DNA from two different
sources. For example, it is possible to place a human gene into
bacterial DNA. Recombinant DNA technology is useful in gene cloning and
in identifying the function of a gene.

Recombinant DNA technology can also be used to produce useful proteins,
such as insulin. To treat diabetes, many people need insulin.
Previously, insulin had been taken from animals. Through recombinant DNA
technology, bacteria were created that carry the human gene which codes
for the production of insulin. These bacteria become tiny factories that
produce this protein. Recombinant DNA technology helps create insulin so
it can be used by humans.

Recombinant DNA technology is used in gene cloning. A **clone** is an
exact genetic copy. Genes are cloned for many reasons, including use in
medicine and in agriculture.

Below are the steps used to copy, or clone, a gene:

1.  A gene or piece of DNA is put in a **vector** , or carrier molecule,
    producing a recombinant DNA molecule.
2.  The vector is placed into a host cell, such as a bacterium.
3.  The gene is copied (or cloned) inside of the bacterium. As the
    bacterial DNA is copied, so is the vector DNA. As the bacteria
    divide, the recombinant DNA molecules are divided between the
    new cells. Over a 12- to 24-hour period, millions of copies of the
    cloned DNA are made.
4.  The cloned DNA can produce a protein (like insulin) that can be used
    in medicine or in research.

#### Plasmids {#4.html#x-ck12-UGxhc21pZHM._17-5a0}

Bacteria have small rings of DNA in the cytoplasm, called **plasmids** (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xMy1QbGFzbWlk) ). A plasmid
is not part of the bacterial chromosome, but an additional pieced of
DNA. When putting foreign DNA into a bacterium, the plasmids are often
used as a vector. Viruses can also be used as vectors. The manipulation
of the plasmid DNA, and then the insertion of the recombinant plasmid
into a bacterium, is an invaluable tool in scientific research.

This image shows a drawing of a plasmid. The plasmid has two large
segments and one small segment depicted. The two large segments (green
and blue) indicate antibiotic resistances usually used in a screening
procedure. The antibiotic resistance segments ensure only bacteria with
the plasmid will grow. The small segment (red) indicates an origin of
replication. The **origin of replication** is where DNA replication
starts, copying the plasmid.

if we allowed human cloning?

### Cloning {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2xvbmluZw.._18-fhs}

**Cloning** is the process of creating an exact genetic replica of an
organism. The clone’s DNA is exactly the same as the parent’s DNA.
Bacteria and other single-celled organisms have long been able to clone
themselves through asexual reproduction. Plants can also reproduce
asexually. In animals, however, cloning does not happen naturally. In
1997, that all changed when a sheep named Dolly was the first large
mammal ever to be successfully cloned. Other animals can now also be
cloned in a laboratory.

The process of producing an animal like Dolly starts with a single cell
from the animal that is going to be cloned. Below are the steps involved
in the process of cloning:

1.  In the case of Dolly, cells from the mammary glands were taken from
    the adult that was to be cloned. But other somatic cells can
    be used. **Somatic cells** come from the body and are not gametes
    like sperm or egg.
2.  The nucleus is removed from this cell. 
3.  The nucleus is placed in a donor egg that has had its
    nucleus removed. The nucleus must be removed from the donor egg to
    maintain the appropriate chromosome number.
4.  The new cell is stimulated with an electric shock and embryo
    development begins, as if it were a normal **zygote** . The zygote
    is the first cell of a new organism.
5.  The resulting embryo is implanted into a mother sheep, where it
    continue its development ( **Figure**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xNC1SZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUtQ2xvbmluZw..) ).

**Figure 4.27**

To clone an animal, a nucleus from the animal’s cells are fused with an
egg cell (from which the nucleus has been removed) from a donor,
creating a new zygote.

#### Is Cloning Easy? {#4.html#x-ck12-SXMgQ2xvbmluZyBFYXN5Pw.._18-ge8}

Cloning is not always successful. Most of the time, this cloning process
does not result in a healthy adult animal. The process has to be
repeated many times until it works. In fact, 277 tries were needed to
produce Dolly. This high failure rate is one reason that human cloning
is banned in the United States. In order to produce a cloned human, many
attempts would result in the surrogate mothers experiencing
miscarriages, stillbirths, or deformities in the infant. There are also
many additional ethical considerations related to human cloning. Can you
think of reasons why people are for or against cloning?

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-cbp}

-   Cloning, or creating an exact replica of an organism, is now
    possible for many animals.
-   There are many ethical considerations related to human cloning, and
    it is now illegal to clone humans in the United States.

**What is your genetic code?**

The sequence of letters above represents bases in someone's DNA. It is
now possible to find out a person's entire genetic code by determining
all the bases in his or her DNA. What might be the benefits?

### Human Genome Project {#4.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gR2Vub21lIFByb2plY3Q._19-7ar}

A person’s **genome** is all of his or her genetic information. In other
words, the human genome is all the information that makes us human. And
unless you have an identical twin, your genome is unique. No one else
has a genome just like yours, though all our genomes are similar.

The **Human Genome Project** ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xNS1odW1hbi1nZW5vbWUtcHJvamVjdA..) )
was an international effort to sequence all 3 billion bases that make up
our DNA and to identify within this code more than 20,000 human genes.
Scientists also completed a chromosome map, identifying where the genes
are located on each of the chromosomes. The Human Genome Project was
completed in 2003. Though the Human Genome Project is finished, analysis
of the data will continue for many years. To say the Human Genome
Project has been beneficial to mankind would be an understatement.

Exciting applications of the Human Genome Project include the following:

-   The genetic basis for many diseases can be more easily determined.
    Now there are tests for over 1,000 genetic disorders.
-   The technologies developed during this effort, and since the
    completion of this project, will reduce the cost of sequencing a
    person's genome. This may eventually allow many people to sequence
    their individual genome.
-   Analysis of your own genome could determine if you are at risk for
    specific diseases.
-   Knowing you might be genetically prone to a certain disease would
    allow you to make preventive lifestyle changes or have
    medical screenings.

**Can doctors fix your DNA?**

There are many genetic disorders that are due to a single gene. What if
we could fix this faulty gene? With the development of gene therapy,
that may eventually be possible for many types of genetic disorders.

### Gene Therapy {#4.html#x-ck12-R2VuZSBUaGVyYXB5_20-ewn}

**Gene therapy** is the insertion of genes into a person’s cells to cure
a genetic disorder. Could gene therapy be the cure for AIDS? No, AIDS is
caused by a virus. Gene therapy only works to fix disorders caused by a
faulty gene. The patient would have had this disorder from birth. Though
gene therapy is still in experimental stages, the common use of this
therapy may occur during your lifetime.

There are two main types of gene therapy:

1.  One done inside the body ( ***in vivo*** ).
2.  One done outside the body ( ***ex vivo*** ).

Both types of gene therapy use a **vector** , or carrier molecule for
the gene. The vector helps incorporate the desired gene into the
patient's DNA. Usually this vector is modified viral DNA in which the
viral genes have been removed. Don't worry, the virus used in gene
therapy has been deactivated.

#### In Vivo Gene Therapy {#4.html#x-ck12-SW4gVml2byBHZW5lIFRoZXJhcHk._20-bd9}

During *in vivo* gene therapy, done inside the body, the vector with the
gene of interest is introduced directly into the patient and taken up by
the patient’s cells ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfTVNfTFNfZ2VuZXRoZXJhcHk.) ). For example,
cystic fibrosis gene therapy is targeted at the respiratory system, so a
solution with the vector can be sprayed into the patient’s nose.
Recently, *in vivo* gene therapy was also used to partially restore the
vision of three young adults with a rare type of eye disease.

**Figure 4.29**

During gene therapy, adenovirus is a possible vector to carry the
desired gene and insert it into the patient's DNA. A deactivated virus
makes a useful vector for this purpose.

</div>

#### *Ex Vivo* Gene Therapy {#4.html#x-ck12-cmlrdXh2aGdjMQ.._20-ijv}

In *ex vivo* gene therapy, done outside the body, cells are removed from
the patient and the proper gene is inserted using a virus as a vector.
The modified cells are placed back into the patient.

One of the first uses of this type of gene therapy was in the treatment
of a young girl with a rare genetic disease, adenosine deaminase
deficiency, or ADA deficiency. People with this disorder are missing the
ADA enzyme, which breaks down a toxin called deoxyadenosine. If the
toxin is not broken down, it accumulates and destroys immune cells. As a
result, individuals with ADA deficiency do not have a healthy immune
system to fight off infections. In the gene therapy treatment for this
disorder, bone marrow stem cells were taken from the girl’s body, and
the missing gene was inserted into these cells outside the body. Then
the modified cells were put back into her bloodstream. This treatment
successfully restored the function of her immune system, but only with
repeated treatments.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-fws}

-   Gene therapy, the insertion of genes into a person’s cells to cure a
    genetic disorder, can be *ex vivo* (outside the body) or *in vivo*
    (inside the body).
-   Gene therapy is still in the experimental stages, but some trials
    have been successful.

**Have you ever eaten genetically engineered foods?**

Most likely, yes. The majority of the corn in the United States is
genetically engineered. Corn syrup is used to sweeten many things, like
this soft drink. Corn is also fed to the cows that provided this
hamburger.

### Biotechnology in Agriculture {#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvdGVjaG5vbG9neSBpbiBBZ3JpY3VsdHVyZQ.._21-ake}

**Biotechnology** is changing the genetic makeup of living things to
make a useful product. Biotechnology has led scientists to develop
useful applications in agriculture and food science. These include the
development of **transgenic** crops. In transgenic crops, genes are
placed into plants to give the crop a beneficial trait. Benefits
include:

-   Improved yield from crops.
-   Increased resistance of crops to environmental stresses.
-   Increased nutritional qualities of food crops.
-   Improved taste, texture or appearance of food.
-   Reduced dependence on fertilizers, insecticides, and
    other chemicals.

Crops are obviously dependent on environmental conditions. Drought can
destroy crop yields, as can too much rain and floods. But what if crops
could be developed to withstand these harsh conditions?

Biotechnology will allow the development of crops containing genes that
will help them to withstand harsh conditions. For example, drought and
salty soil are two significant factors affecting how well crops grow.
But there are crops that can withstand these harsh conditions. Why?
Probably because of that plant's genetics. So scientists are studying
plants that can cope with these extreme conditions. They hope to
identify and isolate the genes that control these beneficial traits. The
genes could then be transferred into more desirable crops, with the hope
of producing the same traits in those crops.

Thale cress ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNi0xNi1BcmFiaWRvcHNpc190aGFsaWFuYS1mbG93ZXI.)
), a species of ***Arabidopsis*** ( *Arabidopsis thaliana* ), is a tiny
weed that has been extensively studied. It is often used for plant
research because it is very easy to grow, and its DNA has been mapped.
Scientists have identified a gene from this plant, At-DBF2, that gives
the plant resistance to some environmental stresses. When this gene is
inserted into tomato and tobacco cells, the cells were able to withstand
environmental stresses like salt, drought, cold, and heat far better
than ordinary cells. If these results prove successful in larger trials,
then At-DBF2 genes could help in engineering crops that can better
withstand harsh environments.

## Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-pwp}

Molecular Biology and Genetics focuses on DNA and how proteins are made,
and how genetic information is passed from one generation to the next.
DNA is the genetic material, which is the material passed from parents
to offspring. It also contains the information used to make RNA. RNA
leaves the nucleus and, together with a ribosome, makes proteins.
Beginning with Mendel's pea plants, genetics has become one of the most
important fields of biology. Human genetics affects many, if not every,
field of medicine. Technologies associated with genetics are involved in
developing products to make our lives better but have raised a number of
ethical, legal, and social issues.

**Do dinosaurs prove evolution?**

For millions of years dinosaurs roamed and dominated the planet. Then 65
million years ago, they went extinct. It's hard to argue that dinosaurs
did not exist. Where did they come from? Where are they now? Evolution
is the "change in species over time."

**Where in the world is this?**

This picture was taken in the Galápagos Islands, which is off the west
coast of South America. The Galápagos Islands are home to many unique
organisms, such as these tree-like cacti. Darwin's observations on these
islands led to his development of the theory of evolution.

### Darwin's Theory of Evolution {#5.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2luJ3MgVGhlb3J5IG9mIEV2b2x1dGlvbg..-hdk}

Do you ever wonder why some birds are big like ostriches and some birds
are small like robins? Or why a lion has a mane while a leopard has
spots? In the 19th century, an English natural scientist named **Charles
Darwin** ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wMS1EYXJ3aW4.) )
was also fascinated by the diversity of life on Earth.

He set out to answer the following questions:

-   Why are organisms different?
-   Why are organisms similar?
-   Why are there so many different types of organisms?

To answer his questions, he developed what we now call "the theory of
evolution by natural selection." This theory is one of the most
important theories in the field of life science. In everyday English,
"evolution" simply means "change." In biology, **evolution** states that
all living organisms came from earlier forms of life. The theory of
evolution by natural selection explains why evolution occurs. Darwin
spent over 20 years traveling around the world and making observations
before he fully developed his theory.

Charles Darwin was one of the most influential scientists who has ever
lived. Darwin introduced the world to the theory of evolution by natural
selection, which laid the foundation for how we understand the living
world today.

#### Voyage of the *HMS Beagle* {#5.html#x-ck12-Vm95YWdlIG9mIHRoZQ..-61g}

In 1859, Charles Darwin published his book, *On the Origin of Species by
Means of Natural Selection* (often known as  *The Origin of Species* ).
His book describes the observations and evidence that he collected more
than 20 years of research, beginning with a five-year voyage around the
world on a British research ship, the ***HMS Beagle*** . During the
voyage ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wMi1CZWFnbGUtbWFw)
), Darwin made observations about plants and animals around the world.
He also collected specimens to study for when he returned to England.

Each time the *HMS Beagle* stopped at a port, Darwin went on land to
explore and look at the local plants, animals, and fossils. One of the
most important things Darwin did was keep a diary. He took detailed
notes and made drawings of his observations.

#### The Galápagos Islands {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdhbMOhcGFnb3MgSXNsYW5kcw..-xyd}

While the crew of the *HMS Beagle* mapped the coastline of South
America, they traveled to a group of islands called the Galápagos. The
Galápagos are a group of 16 volcanic islands near the equator, about 600
miles from the west coast of South America. Darwin spent months on foot
exploring the islands. The specimens he collected from the Galápagos and
sent back to England greatly influenced his ideas of evolution (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wMy1HYWxhcGFnb3M.) ).

The Galápagos Islands are a group of 16 volcanic islands 600 miles off
the west coast of South America. The islands are famous for their many
species found nowhere else. It was on these islands where Darwin began
to develop his theory of evolution.

</div>

On the Galápagos, Darwin observed that the same kind of animal differed
from one island to another. For example, the iguanas (large lizards)
differed between islands ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wNC1JZ3VhbmFz) ). The members of one
iguana species spent most of their time in the ocean, swimming and
diving underwater for seaweed, while those of another iguana species
lived on land and ate cactus. Darwin wondered why there were two species
of iguanas on the same set of islands that were so different from one
another. What do you think?

Islands. Here both a land iguana and a marine iguana are shown.

#### Giant Tortoises {#5.html#x-ck12-R2lhbnQgVG9ydG9pc2Vz-uen}

Darwin also observed giant tortoises on the Galápagos ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtdG9ydG9pc2U.) ). These tortoises were so
large that two people could ride on them. Darwin noticed that different
tortoise species lived on islands with different environments. He
realized that the tortoises had traits that allowed them to live in
their particular environments. For example, tortoises that ate plants
near the ground had rounded shells and shorter necks. Tortoises on
islands with tall shrubs had longer necks and shells that bent upward,
allowing them to stretch their necks ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtdG9ydG9pc2U.) ). Darwin began to
hypothesize that organisms developed traits over time because of
differences in their environments. Darwin began to think that organisms
evolved **adaptations** that allowed them to live in their environment.
These adaptations were beneficial traits for their environment.

The name “Galápagos” means “giant tortoise.” When Darwin arrived on the
Galápagos Islands, he was amazed by the size and variety of shapes of
these animals. The giant tortoise (left) is a unique animal found only
in the Galápagos Islands. There are only about 200 tortoises remaining
on these islands. This Pinta Island tortoise (right) is able to reach
leaves high in shrubs with its long neck and curved shell.

</div>

#### Darwin's Finches {#5.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2luJ3MgRmluY2hlcw..-vyt}

The most studied animals on the Galápagos are finches, a type of bird (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wNy1kYXJ3aW5zLWZpbmNoZXM.)
). When Darwin first observed finches on the islands, he did not even
realize they were all finches. But when he studied them further, he
realized they were related to each other. Each island had its own
distinct species of finch. The birds on different islands had many
similarities, but their beaks differed in size and shape.

Four of Darwin’s finch species from the Galápagos Islands. The birds
came from the same finch ancestor. They evolved as they adapted to
different food resources on different islands. The first bird uses its
large beak to crack open and eat large seeds. Bird \#3 is able to pull
small seeds out of small spaces.

</div>

In his diary, Darwin pointed out how each animal is well-suited for its
particular environment. The shapes of the finch beaks on each island
were well-matched with the seeds available on that island, but not the
seeds on other islands. For example, a larger and stronger beak was
needed to break open large seeds on one island, and a small beak was
needed to eat the small seeds on a different island.

**How old is Earth?**

Earth is now believed to be over 4.5 billion years old. But during
Darwin's time, most people believed that the Earth was only about 6,000
years old. If Darwin hadn't learned about the work of geologists that
suggested that the Earth was much older, he might have never have
developed his theory of evolution.

### Darwin's Influences {#5.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2luJ3MgSW5mbHVlbmNlcw.._1-lez}

When Darwin returned to England five years later, in 1836, at the end of
his voyage, he did not rush to announce his discoveries. Unlike other
naturalists before him, Darwin did not want to present any ideas unless
he had strong evidence supporting them. Instead, once Darwin returned to
England, he spent over twenty years examining specimens, talking with
other scientists and collecting more information before he presented his
theories.

Some of Darwin’s ideas conflicted with widely held beliefs, including
those from religious leaders. At that time, many people believed that
organisms never change and never go extinct, and that the world was only
about 6,000 years old, always existing in the same way, never changing.
These beliefs delayed Darwin in presenting his findings.

How did Darwin come up with his theories? Charles Darwin was influenced
by the ideas of several people.

1.  Before the voyage of the *Beagle* , **Jean-Baptiste Lamarck**
    proposed the idea that species change over time. However, Darwin
    differed with Lamarck on several key points. Lamarck proposed that
    traits acquired during one’s lifetime could be passed to the
    next generation. Darwin did not agree with this.
2.  The findings of **Charles Lyell** , a well-known geologist, also
    influenced Darwin. Lyell's writings taught Darwin about geology,
    paleontology, and the changing Earth. Lyell's findings suggested the
    Earth must be much older than 6,000 years. And the evolution of
    life, as Darwin was developing his ideas, would definitely take much
    longer than just 6,000 years. During the Voyage of the *Beagle* ,
    Darwin observed fossils of sea life high up in the mountains. What
    must happen to the Earth for this to occur?  Darwin, using the
    readings of Lyell, took this as evidence of a constantly changing
    Earth. 
3.  After the Voyage of the *Beagle* , another naturalist, **Alfred
    Russel Wallace** ( **Figure**
    [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wOC1BbGZyZWQtd2FsbGFjZQ..) ),
    developed a similar theory of evolution by natural selection.
    Wallace toured South America and made similar observations
    to Darwin's. Darwin and Wallace presented their theories and
    evidence in public together. Due to the large number of observations
    and conclusions he made, Darwin is mostly credited and associated
    with this theory.

selection.

</div>

Imagine developing a theory that conflicted with widely held beliefs of
the time, as Darwin did. Imagine pulling together material from all
these different people, adding his own findings, and turning it all into
his theory. Imagine the torment Darwin must have endured during this
time, knowing the skepticism that would follow the release of his
findings. But, upon his death, Darwin was given one of the highest
honors in England. Darwin is buried in Westminster Abbey, the final
resting place of many of England's kings and queens. Why was he buried
in such an important spot?

### Summary

-   Darwin’s ideas conflicted with widely held beliefs, such as the idea
    that organisms never change and that the world was only about 6,000
    years old.
-   Darwin was influenced by other scientists, including Lamarck, Lyell,

**How is this deer mouse well adapted for life in the forest?**

Notice how its dark coloring would allow the deer mouse to easily hide
from predators on the darkened forest floor. On the other hand, deer
mice that live in the nearby Sand Hills are a lighter, sand-like color.
What caused the deer mice to be so well adapted to their unique
environments? Natural selection.

### Natural Selection {#5.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBTZWxlY3Rpb24._2-ccx}

The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited
traits of a population change over time. **Inherited traits** are
features that are passed from one generation to the next. For example,
your eye color is an inherited trait. You inherited your eye color from
your parents. Inherited traits are different from **acquired traits** ,
or traits that organisms develop over a lifetime, such as strong muscles
from working out ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0wOS1lYXJsb2Jlcw..) ).

trait](ck12_5_files/20150911113107384938.jpeg "Drawing of attached or free human earlobes, which is an inherited trait")

**Figure 5.8**

Human earlobes may be attached or free. You inherited the particular
shape of your earlobes from your parents. Inherited traits are
influenced by genes, which are passed on to offspring and future
generations. Things not influenced by genes are not passed on to your
offspring. Natural selection only operates on traits like earlobe shape
that have a genetic basis, not on traits that are acquired, like a
summer tan.

</div>

**Natural selection** explains how organisms in a population develop
traits that allow them to survive and reproduce. Natural selection means
that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to
offspring; individuals with those traits have a better chance of
surviving. Evolution occurs by natural selection.

Take the giant tortoises on the Galápagos Islands as an example. If a
short-necked tortoise lives on an island with fruit located at a high
level, will the short-necked tortoise survive? No, it will not, because
it will not be able to reach the food it needs to survive. If all of the
short necked tortoises die, and the long-necked tortoises survive, then,
over time, only the long-necked trait will be passed down to offspring.
All of the tortoises with long-necks will be "naturally selected" to
survive. Organisms that are not well-adapted, for whatever reason, to
their environment, will naturally have less of a chance of surviving and
reproducing.

Every plant and animal depends on its traits to survive. Survival may
include getting food, building homes, and attracting mates. Traits that
allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its
environment are called **adaptations** .

Natural selection occurs when:

1.  There is some variation in the inherited traits of organisms within
    a species. Without this variation, natural selection would not
    be possible.
2.  Some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others
    in surviving and reproducing.
3.  These individuals will be likely to have more offspring.

Imagine how in the Arctic, dark fur makes a rabbit easy for foxes to
spot and catch in the snow. Therefore, white fur is a beneficial trait
that improves the chance that a rabbit will survive, reproduce, and pass
the trait of white fur on to its offspring ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0xMC1hcmN0aWMtaGFyZXM.) ). Through this
process of natural selection, dark fur rabbits will become uncommon over
time. Rabbits will adapt to have white fur. In essence, the selection of
rabbits with white fur - the beneficial trait - is a natural process.

#### Why So Many Species? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFNvIE1hbnkgU3BlY2llcz8._2-cjs}

Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million
species on the planet. But why are there so many? Different species are
well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of
environments. As environments change over time, organisms must
constantly adapt to those environments. Diversity of species increases
the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major
changes in the environment. For example, if a natural disaster kills all
of the large organisms on the planet, then the small organisms will
continue to survive.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-9gu}

-   Evolution occurs by natural selection, the process by which
    organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their
    environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers.
    Evolution is due to differences in the survival and reproduction of
    individuals within a population.
-   Natural selection occurs when there is some variation in the
    inherited traits, some of these traits will give individuals an
    advantage over others, and the individuals with certain traits will
    be more likely to have more offspring.

**What's on this rock?**

This rock contains a portion of a fossilized tree fern. Scientists study
fossils of plants, animals, and other organisms in order to better
understand what life was like on Earth many years ago and how it has
changed over time. Fossils are important evidence for the theory of
evolution.

### The Fossil Record {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZvc3NpbCBSZWNvcmQ._3-las}

**Fossils** are the preserved remains of animals, plants, and other
organisms from the distant past. Examples of fossils include bones,
teeth, and impressions. By studying fossils, evidence for evolution is
revealed. **Paleontologists** are scientists who study fossils to learn
about life in the past. Fossils allow these scientists to determine the
features of extinct species. Paleontologists compare the features of
species from different periods in history. With this information, they
try to understand how species have evolved over millions of years (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0xMS1Ib3JzZWV2b2x1dGlvbg..)
).

Evolution of the horse. Fossil evidence, depicted by the skeletal
fragments, demonstrates evolutionary milestones in this process. Notice
the 57 million year evolution of the horse leg bones and teeth.
Especially obvious is the transformation of the leg bones from having
four distinct digits to that of today's horse.

</div>

Until recently, fossils were the main source of evidence for evolution (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0xMy1pbnNlY3QtcmVzaW4.) ).
Through studying fossils, we now know that today's organisms look much
different in many cases than those that were alive in the past.
Scientists have also shown that organisms were spread out differently
across the planet. Earthquakes, volcanoes, shifting seas, and other
movements of the continents have all affected where organisms live and
how they adapted to their changing environments.

#### Rock Layers and the Age of Fossils {#5.html#x-ck12-Um9jayBMYXllcnMgYW5kIHRoZSBBZ2Ugb2YgRm9zc2lscw.._3-hm8}

There are many layers of rock in the Earth's surface. Newer layers form
on top of the older layers; the deepest rock layers are the oldest.
Therefore, you can tell how old a fossil is by observing in which layer
of rock it was found. The fossils and the order in which fossils appear
is called the **fossil record** . The fossil record provides evidence
for when organisms lived on Earth, how species evolved, and how some
species have gone extinct. Geologists use a method called **radiometric
dating** to determine the exact age of rocks and fossils in each layer
of rock. This technique, which is possible because radioactive materials
decay at a known rate, measures how much of the radioactive materials in
each rock layer have broken down ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0xNC1TcGVjdHJvcGhvdG9tZXRlcg..) ).

This device, called a spectrophotometer, can be used to measure the
level of radioactive decay of certain elements in rocks and fossils to
determine their age.

</div>

Radiometric dating has been used to determine that the oldest known
rocks on Earth are between 4 and 5 billion years old. The oldest fossils
are between 3 and 4 billion years old. Remember that during Darwin's
time, people believed the Earth was just about 6,000 years old. The
fossil record proves that Earth is much older than people once thought.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-qxy}

-   Fossils, or preserved parts of organisms from the distant past, have
    shown that species change over time.
-   Radiometric dating can be used to determine the age of fossils by
    measuring the how much of the radioactive materials in each rock
    layer have broken down.

**Why do you have a tail bone?**

If you look closely at a skeleton, you might notice a triangular bone at
the end of the spinal column. This is your tailbone. Why would you have
a tailbone when you don't have a tail? You have a tailbone because your
ancient ancestors *did* have a tail. These sorts of "left-over"
structures support the theory of evolution.

### Structural Evidence {#5.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJhbCBFdmlkZW5jZQ.._4-cit}

Even though two different species may not look similar, they may have
similar internal structures that suggest they have a **common ancestor**
. That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time
ago. Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure
of the organism as it first develops.

#### Vestigial Structures {#5.html#x-ck12-VmVzdGlnaWFsIFN0cnVjdHVyZXM._4-dh1}

Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body
parts that have lost their use through evolution ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0xNS1Nb2xlLVJhdA..) ). For example,
most birds need their wings to fly. But the wings of an ostrich have
lost their original use. Structures that have lost their use through
evolution are called **vestigial structures** . They provide evidence
for evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using
the structure to not using the structure, or using it for a different
purpose.

Penguins do not use their wings, known as flippers, to fly in the air.
However, they do use them to move in the water. The theory of evolution
suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different
purpose. A whale’s pelvic bones, which were once attached to legs, are
also vestigial structures. Whales are descended from land-dwelling
ancestors that had legs.

**Homologous structures** are structures that have a common function and
suggest common ancestry. For example, homologous structures include the
limbs of mammals, such as bats, lions, whales, and humans, which all
have a common ancestor. Different mammals may use their limbs for
walking, running, swimming or flying. The method the mammal uses to move
is considered a common function.

Moles live underground where they do not need eyes to find their way
around. This mole’s eyes are covered by skin. Body parts that do not
serve their original function are vestigial structures.

</div>

#### Similar Embryos {#5.html#x-ck12-U2ltaWxhciBFbWJyeW9z_4-uey}

Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from **embryology** , the
study of how organisms develop. An embryo is an animal or plant in its
earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal
before it is born or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the
embryos of many different species have similar appearances. The embryos
of some species are even difficult to tell apart. Many of these animals
do not differ much in appearance until they develop further.

Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos. For example, human
embryos have gill slits just like fish! In fish they develop into gills,
but in humans they disappear before birth. The presence of the gill
slits suggests that a long time ago humans and fish shared a common
ancestor.

The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related
and have common ancestors. For example, humans did not evolve from
chimpanzees. But the similarities between the embryos of both species
suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees. As our
common ancestor evolved, humans and chimpanzees went down different
evolutionary paths and developed different traits.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-t4e}

-   Vestigial structures, or structures that have lost their use through
    evolution, are important evidence of evolution.
-   Studying the embryos of organisms also provides evidence that two
    very different animals could have descended from a common ancestor.

**How similar are you to a chimpanzee?**

Chimpanzees and humans turn out to be very similar—if you look at their
DNA. When scientists determined the entire genetic code of both humans
and chimpanzees, they found that we have over 98% identical DNA.

### Molecular Evidence {#5.html#x-ck12-TW9sZWN1bGFyIEV2aWRlbmNl_5-h3t}

Arguably, some of the best evidence of evolution comes from examining
the molecules and DNA found in all living things.

Beginning in the 1940s, scientists studying molecules and DNA have
confirmed conclusions about evolution drawn from other forms of
evidence. **Molecular clocks** are used to determine how closely two
species are related by calculating the number of differences between the
species' DNA sequences or amino acid sequences. These clocks are
sometimes called gene clocks or evolutionary clocks. The fewer the
differences, the less time since the species split from each other and
began to evolve into different species ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0xOS1tYW1tYWwtZ2Vub21lcw..) ).

A chicken and a gorilla will have more differences between their DNA and
amino acid sequences than a gorilla and an orangutan. That means the
chicken and gorilla had a common ancestor a very long time ago, while
the gorilla and orangutan shared a more recent common ancestor. This
provides additional evidence that the gorilla and orangutan are more
closely related than the gorilla and the chicken. Which pair of
organisms would have more molecular differences, a mammal and a bird, a
mammal and a frog, or a mammal and a fish?

On the other hand, animals may look similar but can have very different
DNA sequences and evolutionary ancestry. Which would have more DNA
sequences in common, a whale and a horse, or a whale and a shark?

comparison of genomes provides new information about the relationships
among species and how evolution occurs ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0yMC1nZW5lLW1hcA..) ).

Molecular evidence for evolution also includes:

1.  The same biochemical building blocks, such as amino acids and
    nucleotides, are found in all organisms, from bacteria to plants
    and animals. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of
    proteins, and nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.
2.  DNA and RNA determine the development of all organisms.
3.  The similarities and differences between the genomes confirm
    patterns of evolution.

**Why do pesticides sometimes stop working?**

Pesticides were designed to kill bothersome insects. However, sometimes
these pesticides will stop working. A pesticide that has worked in the
past may no longer kill a particular type of insect. This is due to the
development of resistance in the population of insects. The development
of resistance to pesticides is one example of microevolution, a small
change in a population.

### Microevolution and Macroevolution {#5.html#x-ck12-TWljcm9ldm9sdXRpb24gYW5kIE1hY3JvZXZvbHV0aW9u_6-vf2}

Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes? Or is it
possible that drastic environmental changes can cause new species to
evolve? Or can both small and large changes occur?

Evolutionary changes can be both big and small. Some evolutionary
changes do not create new species, but result in changes at the
population level. A **population** is a group of organisms of the same
species that live in the same area ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0yMS1TY2hvb2wtb2YtRmlzaA..) ). But what
exactly is the definition of a species? A **species** is a group of
organisms that have similar characteristics (they are genetically
similar) and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring.

This school of fish are considered members of the same species because

</div>

#### Microevolution {#5.html#x-ck12-TWljcm9ldm9sdXRpb24._6-cks}

You already know that evolution is the change in species over time. Most
evolutionary changes are small and do not lead to the creation of a new
species. When populations change in small ways over time, the process is
called **microevolution** . Microevolution results in changes within a
species.

An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that cannot
be killed by pesticides, called pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. Imagine
that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your
state. Through a random mutation, some of the mosquitoes have resistance
to the pesticide. As a result of the widespread use of this pesticide,
most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.
When these mosquitoes reproduce the next year, they produce more
mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait. Soon, most of the
mosquitoes in your state are resistant to the pesticide.

This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes
with this trait changed. However, this evolutionary change did not
create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant
mosquitoes can still reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant
mosquitoes.

#### Macroevolution {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFjcm9ldm9sdXRpb24._6-dvt}

**Macroevolution** refers to much bigger evolutionary changes that
result in new species. Macroevolution may happen:

1.  When microevolution occurs repeatedly over a long period of time and
    leads to the creation of a new species.
2.  As a result of a major environmental change, such as a volcanic
    eruption, earthquake, or an asteroid hitting Earth, which changes
    the environment so much that natural selection leads to large
    changes in the traits of a species.

After thousands of years of isolation from each other, Darwin's finch
populations have experienced both microevolution and macroevolution.
These finch populations cannot breed with other finch populations when
they are brought together. Since they do not breed together, they are
classified as separate species.

**Would albinism be an advantage?**

This rabbit is albino, meaning it lacks pigment in its skin, fur, and
eyes. The same thing happens in other species, including humans. To most
animals albinism would be a disadvantage since they need to blend into
their environment to avoid predators or catch prey. How, then, does the
gene that causes albinism stay in the gene pool?

### Evolution Acts on the Phenotype {#5.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIEFjdHMgb24gdGhlIFBoZW5vdHlwZQ.._7-j90}

Natural selection acts on the **phenotype** (the traits or
characteristics) of an individual. On the other hand, natural selection
does not act on the underlying **genotype** (the genetic makeup) of an
individual. For many traits, the homozygous genotype, *AA* , for
example, has the same phenotype as the heterozygous *Aa* genotype. If
both an *AA* and *Aa* individual have the same phenotype, the
environment cannot distinguish between them. So natural selection cannot
select for a homozygous individual over a heterozygous individual. Even
if the "aa" phenotype is lethal, the recessive *a* allele, will be
maintained in the population through heterozygous *Aa* individuals.
Furthermore, the mating of two heterozygous individuals can produce
homozygous recessive ( *aa* ) individuals. However, natural selection
can and does differentiate between dominant and recessive phenotypes.

#### Carriers {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FycmllcnM._7-4hj}

Since natural selection acts on the phenotype, if an allele causes death
in a homozygous individual, *aa* , for example, it will not cause death
in a heterozygous *Aa* individual. These heterozygous *Aa* individuals
will then act as **carriers** of the *a* allele, meaning that the *a*
allele could be passed down to offspring. People who are carriers do not
express the recessive phenotype, as they have a dominant allele. This
allele is said to be kept in the population's gene pool. The **gene
pool** is the complete set of genes and alleles within a population.

For example, Tay-Sachs disease is a recessive human genetic disorder.
That means only individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, *rr*
will be affected. Affected individuals usually die from complications of
the disease in early childhood, at an age too young to reproduce. The
two parents are each heterozygous ( *Rr* ) for the Tay-Sachs gene; they
will not die in childhood and will be carriers of the disease gene. This
deadly allele is kept in the gene pool even though it does not help
humans adapt to their environment. This happens because evolution acts
on the phenotype, not the genotype ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0yMi10YXktc2FjaHM.) ).

**Can these stones keep balance indefinitely?**

If balance, or equilibrium, is to be maintained, there must be no
outside influences on the stones. Equilibrium can also be maintained
within a population's genes; that means, no evolution can occur. But
outside influences usually prevent equilibrium from staying established.

### Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium {#5.html#x-ck12-SGFyZHktV2VpbmJlcmcgRXF1aWxpYnJpdW0._8-cst}

Sometimes understanding how common a gene is within a population is
necessary. Or, more specifically, you may want to know how common a
certain form of that gene is within the population, such as a recessive
form. This can be done using the Hardy-Weinberg model, but it can only
be done if the frequencies of the genes are not changing.

The **Hardy-Weinberg model** describes how a population can remain at
**genetic equilibrium** , referred to as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Genetic equilibrium occurs when there is no evolution within the
population. In other words, the frequency of **alleles** (variants of a
gene) will be the same from one generation to another. At genetic
equilibrium, the gene or allele frequencies are stable <span class="c1">
— </span> they do not change. For example, let's assume that red hair is
determined by the inheritance of a gene with two alleles— *R* and *r* .
The dominant allele, *R* , encodes for non-red hair, while the recessive
allele, *r* , encodes for red hair. If a population's **gene pool**
contains 90% *R* and 10% *r* alleles, then the next generation would
also have 90% *R* and 10% *r* alleles. However, this only works under a
strict set of conditions.

The five conditions that must be met for genetic equilibrium to occur
include:

1.  No mutation (change) in the DNA sequence.
2.  No **migration** (moving into or out of a population).
3.  A very large population size.
4.  Random mating.
5.  No natural selection.

These five conditions rarely occur in nature. When one or more of the
conditions does not exist, then evolution can occur. As a result, allele
frequencies are constantly changing, and populations are constantly
evolving. As mutations and natural selection occur frequently in nature,
it is difficult for a population to be at genetic equilibrium.

The Hardy-Weinberg model also serves a mathematical formula used to
predict allele frequencies in a population at genetic equilibrium. If
you know the allele frequencies of one generation, you can use this
formula to predict the next generation. Again, this only works if all
five conditions are being met in a population.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-wn1}

-   If a population stays at genetic equilibrium, then no evolution
    takes place.
-   The Hardy-Weinberg model states that a population will remain at
    genetic equilibrium as long as five conditions are met: (1) No
    change in the DNA sequence, (2) No migration, (3) A very large
    population size, (4) Random mating, and (5) No natural selection.

**Where did this diversity of life come from?**

If you have ever been to the beach, then you realize there is not just
one species of marine life. The wide variety of shells that wash up on
the beach indicate that there are many forms of life in the ocean. This
wide diversity of life requires that many new species have appeared over
time. But how does a new species come into being?

### The Origin of Species {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE9yaWdpbiBvZiBTcGVjaWVz_9-dcs}

The creation of a new species is called **speciation** . Most new
species develop naturally. But humans have also artificially created new
breeds and species for thousands of years.

New species develop naturally through the process of **natural
selection** . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that
better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive
and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial
heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable
heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is
beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees.
Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common
than short necks.

As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a
population's gene pool (changing the population's allele frequencies),
some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow
adaptation and survival. Natural selection causes evolution of a species
as these beneficial traits become more common within a population.

#### Artificial Selection {#5.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aWZpY2lhbCBTZWxlY3Rpb24._9-y2q}

**Artificial selection** occurs when humans select which plants or
animals to breed in order to pass on specific traits to the next
generation. For example, a farmer may choose to breed only cows that
produce the best milk. Farmers would also avoid breeding cows that
produce less milk. In this way, selective breeding of the cows would
increase milk quality and quantity.

Humans have also artificially bred dogs to create new breeds (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0yMy1kb2dz) ).

different breeds. Both dog breeds are descended from the same wolves,
and their genes are almost identical.

</div>

#### Reproductive Isolation {#5.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlIElzb2xhdGlvbg.._9-ptf}

There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally. Both
processes create new species by reproductively isolating populations of
the same species from each other. Organisms can be geographically
isolated or isolated by a behavior. Either way, they will no longer be
able to mate. Over a long period of time, usually thousands of years,
each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction,
forming distinct species.

How do you think scientists test whether two populations are separate
species? They bring species from two populations back together again. If
the two populations do not mate and produce fertile offspring, they are
separate species.

#### Geographic Isolation {#5.html#x-ck12-R2VvZ3JhcGhpYyBJc29sYXRpb24._9-mwe}

**Allopatric speciation** occurs when groups from the same species are
geographically isolated for long periods. Imagine all the ways that
plants or animals could be isolated from each other:

-   Emergence of a mountain range.
-   Formation of a canyon.
-   New rivers or streams.

Here are two examples of allopatric speciation:

-   Darwin observed thirteen distinct finch species on the Galápagos
    Islands that had evolved from the same ancestor. Different finch
    populations lived on separate islands with different environments.
    They evolved to best adapt to those particular environments. Later,
    scientists were able to determine which finches had evolved into
    distinct species by bringing members of each population together.
    The birds that could not mate were a separate species.

<!-- -->

-   When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed, two populations of one
    squirrel species were separated by the giant canyon. After thousands
    of years of isolation from each other, the squirrel populations on
    the northern wall of the canyon looked and behaved differently from
    those on the southern wall ( **Figure**
    [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDctMjQtc3F1aXJyZWxz) ). North rim
    squirrels have white tails and black bellies. Squirrels on the south
    rim have white bellies and dark tails. They cannot mate with each
    other, so they are different species.

#### Isolation without Physical Separation {#5.html#x-ck12-SXNvbGF0aW9uIHdpdGhvdXQgUGh5c2ljYWwgU2VwYXJhdGlvbg.._9-mbp}

**Sympatric speciation** occurs when groups from the same species stop
mating because of something other than physical or geographic
separation. The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is
an example of such separation. The separation may be caused by different
mating seasons, for example. Sympatric speciation is more difficult to
identify.

Here are two examples of sympatric speciation:

-   Some scientists suspect that two groups of orcas (killer whales)
    live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean part of the year but do
    not mate. The two groups hunt different prey species, eat different
    foods, sing different songs, and have different social interactions
    ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0yNi1PcmNh) ).

<!-- -->

-   Two groups of Galápagos Island finch species lived in the same
    space, but each had his or her own distinct mating signals. Members
    of each group selected mates according to different beak structures
    and bird calls. The behavioral differences kept the groups separated
    until they formed different species.

-   Speciation, the creation of a new species, can happen through
    natural selection or artificial selection.
-   Reproductive isolation is necessary for speciation to occur, and
    this can happen through a geographic barrier (allopatric speciation)
    or without a geographic barrier (sympatric speciation).

**Can you watch evolution happening?**

Usually evolutionary changes occur at a very slow pace. Human evolution
took millions of years. However, sometimes evolution can also happen
quite quickly.

### Tracing Evolution {#5.html#x-ck12-VHJhY2luZyBFdm9sdXRpb24._10-oxu}

How fast is evolution? Can you actually see evolution happening within
your lifetime? Usually evolution takes a long time. So how can we
visualize how it has happened?

#### Rates of Evolution {#5.html#x-ck12-UmF0ZXMgb2YgRXZvbHV0aW9u_10-bp7}

How long did it take for the giraffe to develop a long neck? How long
did it take for the Galápagos finches to evolve? How long did it take
for whales to evolve from land mammals? These, and other questions about
the rate of evolution, are difficult to answer.

The **rate of evolution** depends on how many of an organism’s genes
have changed over a period of time. Evolution is usually so gradual that
we do not see the change for many, many generations.

Not all organisms evolve at the same rate. Humans took millions of years
to evolve from a mammal that is now extinct. It is very difficult to
observe evolution in humans. However, there are organisms that are
evolving so fast that you can observe evolution! A human takes about 22
years to go through one generation. But some bacteria go through over a
thousand generations in less than two months. Some bacteria go through
many generations in a few days. And sometimes a bacterial generation is
as fast as 20 minutes! We can actually trace their evolution as it is
happening.

#### Evolutionary Trees {#5.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uYXJ5IFRyZWVz_10-xg1}

If evolution can take a very long time, how can we visualize how it
happens? Charles Darwin came up with the idea of an **evolutionary
tree** to represent the relationships between different species and
their common ancestors ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDMtVHJlZS1vZi1MaWZl) ). The base of the
tree represents the ancient ancestors of all life. The separation into
large branches shows where these original species evolved into new
species.

The branches keep splitting into smaller and smaller branches as species
continue to evolve into more and more species. Some species are
represented by short twigs spurting out of the tree, then stopping.
These are species that went extinct before evolving into new species.
Other “Trees of Life” have been created by other scientists ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDMtVHJlZS1vZi1MaWZl) ).

Darwin drew this version of the “Tree of Life” on the left to represent
how species evolve and diverge into separate directions. Each point on
the tree where one branch splits off from another represents the common

many different versions of the “Tree of Life” to show different features
of evolution. The Tree of Life on the right was made by Ernst Haeckel in
1879.

**What did the first life forms look like?**

The first forms of life on Earth were probably smaller and simpler than
even these bacteria. The first forms of life had to be simple
single-celled organisms. But how did life begin on Earth?

### Origin of Life {#5.html#x-ck12-T3JpZ2luIG9mIExpZmU._11-kym}

There is good evidence that life has probably existed on Earth for most
of Earth’s history. Fossils of blue-green algae found in Australia are
the oldest fossils of life forms on Earth. They are at least 3.5 billion
years old ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0yOS1hdXN0cmFsaWEtY29hc3Q.) ).

#### Life from Random Reactions {#5.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBmcm9tIFJhbmRvbSBSZWFjdGlvbnM._11-ahx}

How did life begin? In order to answer this question, scientists need to
know what kinds of materials were available at that time. We know that
the ingredients for life were present at the beginning of Earth’s
history. Scientists believe early Earth did not contain oxygen gas, but
did contain other gases, including:

-   nitrogen,
-   carbon dioxide,
-   carbon monoxide,
-   water vapor,
-   hydrogen sulfide.

Where did these ingredients come from? Some chemicals were in water and
volcanic gases ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0zMC1ob3Qtc3ByaW5ncw..) ). Other
chemicals would have come from meteorites in space. Energy to drive
chemical reactions was provided by volcanic eruptions and lightning.
Today, we have evidence that life on Earth came from random reactions
between chemical compounds, which formed **molecules** , or groups of
atoms bonded together. Small molecules, such as those present in the
early atmosphere, can provide the components (including the elements C,
H, N, O and S) to make larger molecules. These early molecules further
reacted and eventually formed even larger molecules and **organic
compounds** , such as amino acids (and then proteins), and nucleotides
(which form nucleic acids - RNA or DNA). These molecules eventually came
together in the right combinations to form basic cells. The components
that were necessary for the formation of the first cells are still being
studied.

How long did it take to develop the first life forms? As much as 1
billion years. Many scientists still study the origin of the first life
forms because there are many questions left unanswered, such as, "Did
proteins or nucleic acids develop first?" or "What exactly were early
Earth's atmospheric conditions like?" There is a lot of work still left
to answer these and similar questions.

**Which was first, the insect or the flower?**

Although the land plants were here before insects, the first flowers
evolved long after the first insects. The first land plants did not have
flowers. Today insects and flowers are so interconnected, it's hard to
imagine one without the other.

### Timeline of Evolution {#5.html#x-ck12-VGltZWxpbmUgb2YgRXZvbHV0aW9u_12-t1p}

For life to evolve from simple single-celled organisms to many millions
of species of prokaryotic species to simple eukaryotic species to all
the protists, fungi, plants, and animals, took some time. Well over 3
billion years.

#### The Age of Earth {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEFnZSBvZiBFYXJ0aA.._12-pq0}

How old is Earth? How was it formed? How did life begin on Earth? These
questions have fascinated scientists for centuries. During the 1800s,
geologists, paleontologists, and naturalists found several forms of
physical evidence that confirmed that Earth is very old.

The evidence includes:

-   Fossils of ancient sea life on dry land far from oceans. This
    supported the idea that the Earth changed over time and that some
    dry land today was once covered by oceans.
-   The many layers of rock. When people realized that rock layers
    represent the order in which rocks and fossils appeared, they were
    able to trace the history of Earth and life on Earth.
-   Indications that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion that
    happened long ago shaped much of the Earth’s surface. This supported
    the idea of an older Earth.

The Earth is at least as old as its oldest rocks. The oldest rock
minerals found on Earth so far are crystals that are at least 4.404
billion years old. These tiny crystals were found in Australia.
Likewise, Earth cannot be older than the solar system. The oldest
possible age of Earth is 4.57 billion years old, the age of the solar
system. Therefore, the age of Earth is between 4.4 and 4.57 billion
years.

#### Geologic Time Scale {#5.html#x-ck12-R2VvbG9naWMgVGltZSBTY2FsZQ.._12-wgv}

Geologists and other Earth scientists use **geologic time scales** to
describe when events happened in the history of Earth. The time scales
can be used to show when both geologic events and events affecting plant
and animal life occurred. The geologic time scale pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0zMS1nZW9sb2dpY2FsLXRpbWU.)
) illustrates the timing of events like:

-   Earthquakes.
-   Volcanic eruptions.
-   Major erosion.
-   Meteorites hitting Earth.
-   The first signs of life forms.
-   Mass extinctions.

**Figure 5.24**

The geologic time scale of Earth's past is organized according to events
that took place during different periods on the time scale. Geologic
time is the same as the age of the Earth: between 4.404 and 4.57 billion
years. Look closely for such events as the extinction of dinosaurs and
many marine animals.

</div>

#### Evolution of Major Life Forms {#5.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE1ham9yIExpZmUgRm9ybXM._12-lwg}

Life on Earth began about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The first life
forms were single-celled organisms similar to bacteria. The first
multicellular organisms did not appear until about 610 million years
ago. Many different types of organisms evolved during the next ten
million years, in an event called the **Cambrian Explosion** . This
sudden burst of evolution may have been caused by some environmental
changes that made the Earth's environment more suitable for a wider
variety of life forms.

Plants and fungi did not appear until roughly 500 million years ago.
They were soon followed by arthropods (insects and spiders). Next came
the amphibians about 300 million years ago, followed by mammals around
200 million years ago and birds around 100 million years ago.

Even though large life forms have been very successful on Earth, most of
the life forms on Earth today are still prokaryotes—small, relatively
simple single-celled organisms. Fossils indicate that many organisms
that lived long ago are extinct. Extinction of species is common; in
fact, it is estimated that 99% of the species that have ever lived on
Earth no longer exist.

The basic timeline of a 4.6 billion-year-old Earth includes the
following:

-   About 3.5 - 3.8 billion years of simple cells (prokaryotes).
-   3 billion years of photosynthesis.
-   2 billion years of complex cells (eukaryotes).
-   1 billion years of multicellular life.
-   600 million years of simple animals.
-   570 million years of arthropods (ancestors of insects, arachnids
    and crustaceans).
-   550 million years of complex animals.
-   500 million years of fish and proto-amphibians.
-   475 million years of land plants.
-   400 million years of insects and seeds.
-   360 million years of amphibians.
-   300 million years of reptiles.
-   200 million years of mammals.
-   150 million years of birds.
-   130 million years of flowers.
-   65 million years since the non-avian dinosaurs died out.
-   2.5 million years since the appearance of *Homo* .
-   200,000 years since the appearance of modern humans.
-   25,000 years since *Neanderthals* died out.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-iln}

**What happened to the dinosaurs?**

Most of the dinosaurs disappeared from Earth about 65 million years ago.
This is probably the most famous example of a mass extinction. So how do
you define a mass extinction?

### Mass Extinctions {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFzcyBFeHRpbmN0aW9ucw.._13-nao}

An organism goes extinct when all of the members of a species die out
and no more members remain. **Extinctions** are part of natural
selection. Species often go extinct when their environment changes, and
they do not have the traits they need to survive. Only those individuals
with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0zMi1raXdp) ).

**Figure 5.25**

Humans have caused many extinctions by introducing species to new
places. For example, many of New Zealand’s birds have adapted to nesting
on the ground. This was possible because there were no land mammals in
New Zealand. Then Europeans arrived and brought cats, foxes, and other
predators with them. Several of New Zealand’s ground nesting birds, such
as this flightless kiwi, are now extinct or threatened because of these
predators.

</div>

**Mass extinctions** , such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many
marine mammals, happened after major catastrophes such as volcanic
eruptions and earthquakes ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0zMy10YXJib3NhdXJ1cy1mb3NzaWw.) ).

Since life began on Earth, there have been several major mass
extinctions. If you look closely at the geological time scale, you will
find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past
540 million years. In each mass extinction, over 50% of animal species
died. The total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20.

Two of the largest extinctions are described below:

-   At the end of the Permian Period, about 99.5% of individual
    organisms went extinct! Up to 95% of marine species perished,
    compared to “only” 70% of land species. Some scientists theorize
    that the extinction was caused by the formation of **Pangaea,** or
    one large continent made out of many smaller ones. One large
    continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones, so reducing
    the shoreline space may have caused much of the marine life to go
    extinct ( **Figure**
    [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNy0zNC1QYW5nZWE.) ).

**Figure 5.27**

The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a
single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which
harbor marine species. This may have contributed to the dramatic event
which ended the Permian—the most massive extinction ever recorded.

</div>

-   At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all
    dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some
    scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth
    and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal
    waves, changed the climate, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A
    decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food,
    leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an
iridium-rich layer in the Earth, dated at 65.5 million years ago.
Iridium is rare in the Earth’s crust but common in comets and asteroids.
Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind.

After each mass extinction, new species develop to fill the habitats
where old species lived. This is well documented in the fossil record.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-rpl}

-   Extinctions, when a species entirely dies out, can happen when the
    environment changes, and the organisms do not have the traits they
    need to survive.
-   Since life began on Earth, there have been at least five major
    massive extinctions.

Evolution focuses on past life forms and how they turned into present
life forms. The history of life on Earth demonstrates how the first
cells formed, turned into simple life forms, and then became more
complex plants and animals. The studies of Charles Darwin have reshaped
and influenced all aspects of biology. The vast amounts of evidence of
evolution demonstrates the importance of the theory of evolution by
natural selection. But has this process stopped? Of course not.
Evolution does continue today.

**What are the most numerous organisms on the planet?**

The single-celled prokaryotic organism otherwise known as bacteria. And
all it takes is one to quickly grow, under just the right conditions,
into millions and billions. Luckily, we know how to control bacteria
when necessary. But bacteria do serve many important purposes. In fact,
we could not survive without them.

**Are bacteria living things?**

Bacteria are individual living cells. Bacteria cells are similar to your
cells in many ways; yet, they also have distinct differences. Bacteria
have many unique adaptations allowing them to live in many different
environments.

### Characteristics of Bacteria {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEJhY3Rlcmlh-awx}

Bacteria are the most successful organisms on the planet. They lived on
this planet for two billion years before the first eukaryotes and,
during that time, evolved into millions of different species.

#### Size and Shape {#6.html#x-ck12-U2l6ZSBhbmQgU2hhcGU.-iwe}

Bacteria are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope. When
viewed under the microscope, they have three distinct shapes (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0wMS1iYWN0ZXJpYS1mb3Jtcw..)
). Bacteria can be identified and classified by their shape:

1.  **Bacilli** are rod-shaped.
2.  **Cocci** are sphere-shaped.
3.  **Spirilli** are spiral-shaped.

![Drawing of rod, sphere, and spiral shaped
bacteria](ck12_6_files/20150911113137254732.jpeg "Drawing of rod, sphere, and spiral shaped bacteria")

**Figure 6.1**

Bacteria come in many different shapes. Some of the most common shapes
are bacilli (rods), cocci (spheres), and spirilli (spirals). Bacteria
can be identified and classified by their shape.

</div>

#### Similarities to Eukaryotes {#6.html#x-ck12-U2ltaWxhcml0aWVzIHRvIEV1a2FyeW90ZXM.-z3h}

Like eukaryotic cells, bacterial cells have:

1.  Cytoplasm, the fluid inside the cell.
2.  A plasma or cell membrane, which acts as a barrier around the cell.
3.  Ribosomes, in which proteins are put together.
4.  DNA. By contrast though, bacterial DNA is contained in a large,
    circular strand. This single chromosome is located in a region of
    the cell called the **nucleoid** . Many bacteria also have
    additional small rings of DNA known as **plasmids** .

See bacterial cell pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0wNC1iYWN0ZXJpYWwtY2VsbA..) ).

![Structure of a bacterial
cell](ck12_6_files/20150911113137530114.png "Structure of a bacterial cell")

**Figure 6.2**

The structure of a bacterial cell is distinctive from a eukaryotic cell
because of features such as an outer cell wall, the circular DNA of the
nucleoid, and the lack of membrane-bound organelles.

</div>

#### Unique Features {#6.html#x-ck12-VW5pcXVlIEZlYXR1cmVz-kqj}

Bacteria lack many of the structures that eukaryotic cells contain. For
example, they don't have a nucleus. They also lack membrane-bound
organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. The DNA of a bacterial
cell is also different from a eukaryotic cell. Bacterial DNA is
contained in one circular chromosome, located in the cytoplasm.
Eukaryotes have several linear chromosomes. Bacteria also have two
additional unique features: a cell wall and flagella.

#### The Cell Wall {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbGwgV2FsbA..-y62}

Bacteria are surrounded by a **cell wall** consisting of
**peptidoglycan** . This complex molecule consists of sugars and amino
acids. The cell wall is important for protecting bacteria. The cell wall
is so important that some antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacteria
by preventing the cell wall from forming.

Some bacteria depend on a host organism for energy and nutrients. These
bacteria are known as **parasites** . If the host starts attacking the
parasitic bacteria, the bacteria release a layer of slime that surrounds
the cell wall. This slime offers an extra layer of protection.

#### Flagella {#6.html#x-ck12-RmxhZ2VsbGE.-so9}

Some bacteria also have tail-like structures called flagella (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0wNS1mbGFnZWxsYQ..) ).
**Flagella** help bacteria move. As the flagella rotate, they spin the
bacteria and propel them forward. Though some eukaryotic cells do have a
flagella, a flagella in eukaryotes is rare.

two, or many flagella—or none at all.

**Can bacteria make their own food from sunlight?**

Plants aren't the only organisms that use the energy of the sun to make
food. Some bacteria can also perform photosynthesis. In fact, the first
photosynthetic organisms on Earth were bacteria. Photosynthesis is just
one of many ways that bacteria can obtain energy.

### Bacteria Nutrition {#6.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWEgTnV0cml0aW9u_1-aif}

Like all organisms, bacteria need energy, and they can acquire this
energy through a number of different ways.

#### Photosynthesis {#6.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXM._1-usb}

Photosynthetic bacteria use the energy of the sun to make their own
food. In the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are turned
into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is then turned into usable energy.
Glucose is like the "food" for the bacteria. An example of
photosynthetic bacteria is cyanobacteria, as seen in the opening image.

#### Decomposers {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVjb21wb3NlcnM._1-wtk}

Bacteria known as decomposers break down wastes and dead organisms into
smaller molecules. These bacteria use the organic substrates they break
down to get their energy, carbon, and nutrients they need for survival.

#### Chemotrophs {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbW90cm9waHM._1-pca}

Bacteria can also be chemotrophs. Chemosynthetic bacteria, or
**chemotrophs** , obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in
their environment. An example of one of these chemicals broken down by
bacteria is nitrogen-containing ammonia. These bacteria are important
because they help cycle nitrogen through the environment for other
living things to use. Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it
must be continually recycled. Organisms need nitrogen to make organic
compounds, such as DNA.

#### Mutualism {#6.html#x-ck12-TXV0dWFsaXNt_1-qvm}

Some bacteria depend on other organisms for survival. For example, some
bacteria live in the roots of legumes, such as pea plants ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wNS1wbGFudC1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) ). The
bacteria turn nitrogen-containing molecules into nitrogen that the plant
can use. Meanwhile, the root provides nutrients to the bacteria. In this
relationship, both the bacteria and the plant benefit, so it is known as
a **mutualism** .

These mutualistic bacteria-containing nodules on a soybean root help

#### Parasitism {#6.html#x-ck12-UGFyYXNpdGlzbQ.._1-mgs}

Other bacteria are parasitic and can cause illness. In **parasitism** ,
the bacteria benefit, and the other organism is harmed. Harmful bacteria
will be discussed in another concept.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-5k8}

-   Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by performing
    photosynthesis, decomposing dead organisms and wastes, or breaking
    down chemical compounds.
-   Bacteria can obtain energy and nutrients by establishing close
    relationships with other organisms, including mutualistic and
    parasitic relationships.

**How can bacteria reproduce so rapidly?**

Bacteria can divide very rapidly. This image is of a growing colony of
*E. coli* bacteria. In the right environment, a single *E. coli* can
divide to form a colony of hundreds of bacteria in just a few hours.

### Bacteria Reproduction {#6.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWEgUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_2-dfa}

Bacteria, being single-celled prokaryotic organisms, do not have a male
or female version. Bacteria reproduce asexually. In **asexual
reproduction** , the "parent" produces a genetically identical copy of
itself.

#### Binary Fission {#6.html#x-ck12-QmluYXJ5IEZpc3Npb24._2-hsr}

Bacteria reproduce through a process called **binary fission** . During
binary fission, the chromosome copies itself, forming two genetically
identical copies. Then, the cell enlarges and divides into two new
daughter cells. The two daughter cells are identical to the parent cell.
Binary fission can happen very rapidly. Some species of bacteria can
double their population in less than ten minutes!

#### Exchanging DNA {#6.html#x-ck12-RXhjaGFuZ2luZyBETkE._2-bge}

Sexual reproduction does not occur in bacteria. But not all new bacteria
are clones. This is because bacteria can acquire new DNA. This process
occurs in three different ways:

1.  **Conjugation** : In conjugation, DNA passes through an extension on
    the surface of one bacterium and travels to another bacterium (
    **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfQ29uanVnYXRpdmVfcGxhc21pZHM.) ).
    Bacteria essential exchange DNA via conjugation.
2.  **Transformation** : In transformation, bacteria pick up pieces of
    DNA from their environment.
3.  **Transduction** : In transduction, viruses that infect bacteria
    carry DNA from one bacterium to another.

**Where does cheese come from?**

Bacteria are often used to make cheese from milk. But making foods is
not the only beneficial role of bacteria. For example, they also play an
essential role in your gut!

### Helpful Bacteria {#6.html#x-ck12-SGVscGZ1bCBCYWN0ZXJpYQ.._3-7ry}

Can we survive without bacteria? Could bacteria survive without us? No
and yes. No, we could not survive without bacteria. And yes, bacteria
could survive without us.

#### Foods {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZHM._3-etn}

Bacteria can be used to make cheese from milk. The bacteria turn the
milk sugars into lactic acid. The acid is what causes the milk to curdle
to form cheese. Bacteria are also involved in producing other foods.
Yogurt is made by using bacteria to **ferment** milk ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0wOS15b2d1cnQ.) ). Fermenting cabbage
with bacteria produces sauerkraut.

**Figure 6.6**

Yogurt is made from milk fermented with bacteria. The bacteria ingest
natural milk sugars and release lactic acid as a waste product, which
causes proteins in the milk to form into a solid mass, which becomes the
yogurt.

</div>

#### Medicines {#6.html#x-ck12-TWVkaWNpbmVz_3-bxp}

In the laboratory, bacteria can be changed to provide us with a variety
of useful materials. Bacteria can be used as tiny factories to produce
desired chemicals and medicines. For example, insulin, which is
necessary to treat people with diabetes, can be produced using bacteria.

Through the process of transformation, the human gene for insulin is
placed into bacteria. The bacteria then use that gene to make a protein.
The protein can be separated from the bacteria and then used to treat
patients. The mass production of insulin by bacteria made this medicine
much more affordable.

#### Digestion {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlnZXN0aW9u_3-amw}

Bacteria also help you digest your food. Several species of bacteria,
such as *E. coli* , are found in your digestive tract. In fact, in your
gut, bacteria cells outnumber your own cells!

#### Decomposers {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVjb21wb3NlcnM._3-ewu}

Bacteria are important in practically all ecosystems because many
bacteria are **decomposers** . They break down dead materials and waste
products and recycle nutrients back into the environment. The recycling
of nutrients, such as nitrogen, by bacteria, is essential for living
organisms. Organisms cannot produce nutrients, so they must come from
other sources.

We get nutrients from the food we eat; plants get them from the soil.
How do these nutrients get into the soil? One way is from the actions of
decomposers. Without decomposers, we would eventually run out of the
materials we need to survive. We also depend on bacteria to decompose
our wastes in sewage treatment plants.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-wfp}

**Could this organism make you sick?**

This bacterium, called *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* , causes the disease
Tuberculosis (TB). These bacteria usually attack the lungs. If left
untreated, the infection can be fatal. Many other illnesses, mild and
severe, are also caused by certain types of bacteria.

### Harmful Bacteria {#6.html#x-ck12-SGFybWZ1bCBCYWN0ZXJpYQ.._4-xvq}

With so many species of bacteria, some are bound to be harmful. Harmful
bacteria can make you sick. They can also ruin food and be used to hurt
people.

#### Diseases {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlzZWFzZXM._4-1lf}

There are also ways that bacteria can be harmful to humans and other
animals. Bacteria are responsible for many types of human illness (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfQmxhY2tfRGVhdGg.) ),
including:

-   Strep throat
-   Tuberculosis
-   Pneumonia
-   Leprosy
-   Lyme disease

Luckily most of these can be treated with **antibiotics,** which
kill the bacteria.

**Figure 6.7**

The Black Death, which killed at least one third of Europe’s population
in the 1300s, is believed to have been caused by the bacterium *Yersinia

#### Food Contamination {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBDb250YW1pbmF0aW9u_4-tjz}

Bacterial contamination of foods can lead to digestive problems, an
illness known as **food poisoning** . Raw eggs and undercooked meats
commonly carry the bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Food
poisoning can be prevented by cooking meat thoroughly and washing
surfaces that have been in contact with raw meat. Washing your hands
before and after handling food also helps prevent contamination.

#### Weapons {#6.html#x-ck12-V2VhcG9ucw.._4-jzc}

Some bacteria also have the potential to be used as biological weapons
by terrorists. An example is anthrax, a disease caused by the bacterium
*Bacillus anthracis* . Inhaling the **spores** of this bacterium can
lead to a deadly infection, and, therefore, it is a dangerous weapon. In
2001, an act of terrorism in the United States involved *B. anthracis*
spores sent in letters through the mail.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-kvt}

-   Bacteria are responsible for many types of diseases in humans.
-   Some bacteria can contaminate food and cause food poisoning.
-   Some bacteria have been used as biological weapons by terrorists.

**What organisms can grow in the hot springs of Yellowstone National
Park?**

In the 1970s, a new group of organisms was identified. Unlike other
organisms, these organisms could thrive in temperatures near 100ºC, the
boiling point of water! This new group of organisms was named archaea.

### What are Archaea? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgQXJjaGFlYT8._5-0qc}

For many years, archaea were classified as bacteria. Like the bacteria,
**archaea** lacked a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles and,
therefore, were prokaryotic cells. However, when scientists compared the
DNA of the two prokaryotes, they found that there were distinct
differences. They concluded that there must be two distinct types of
prokaryotes, which they named archaea and bacteria.

Even though the two groups might seem similar, archaea have many
features that distinguish them from bacteria:

1.  The cell walls of archaea are distinct from those of bacteria. While
    bacteria have cell walls made up of the polymer peptidoglycan, most
    archaea do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls.
2.  The plasma membranes of the archaea are also made up of lipids that
    are distinct from those in bacteria.
3.  The ribosomal proteins of the archaea are similar to those in
    eukaryotic cells, not those in bacteria.

Although archaea and bacteria share some fundamental differences, they
are still similar in many ways:

1.  They both are single-celled, microscopic organisms that can come in
    a variety of shapes ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0xMC1hcmNoYWVhLXNoYXBlcw..) ).
2.  Both archaea and bacteria have a single circular chromosome of DNA
    and lack membrane-bound organelles.
3.  Like bacteria, archaea can have flagella to assist with movement.

**Figure 6.8**

Archaea shapes can vary widely, but some are bacilli (rod-shaped).

</div>

#### Obtaining Food and Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-T2J0YWluaW5nIEZvb2QgYW5kIEVuZXJneQ.._5-5zj}

Most archaea are **chemotrophs** and derive their energy and nutrients
from breaking down molecules in their environment. A few species of
archaea are photosynthetic and capture the energy of sunlight. Unlike
bacteria, which can be parasites and are known to cause a variety of
diseases, there are no known archaea that act as parasites. Some archaea
do live within other organisms. But these archea form **mutualistic
relationships** with their host, where both the archaea and the host
benefit. In other words, they assist the host in some way, for example
by helping to digest food.

#### Reproduction {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_5-rhc}

Like bacteria, reproduction in archaea is asexual. Archaea can reproduce
through **binary fission** , where a parent cell divides into two
genetically identical daughter cells. Archaea can also reproduce
asexually through budding and fragmentation, where pieces of the cell
break off and form a new cell, also producing genetically identical
organisms.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-mbf}

-   Archaea are prokaryotes, but they differ from bacteria in their DNA
    and biochemistry.
-   Most archaea are chemotrophs, but some are photosynthetic or form
    mutualistic relationships.
-   Archaea reproduce asexually through binary fission, fragmentation,
    or budding.

**How can termites digest wood?**

Unlike us, termites can get nutrition from wood. Mutualistic archaea
found in the gut of termites help them digest the wood. This is just one
example of the many extreme environments in which archaea can thrive.

### Types of Archaea {#6.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQXJjaGFlYQ.._6-kl6}

The first archaea described could survive in extremely harsh
environments in which no other organisms could survive. As a result,
archaea are often distinguished by the environment in which they live.

#### Halophiles {#6.html#x-ck12-SGFsb3BoaWxlcw.._6-ynv}

The **halophiles** , which means "salt-loving," live in environments
with high levels of salt ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0xMS1oYWxvcGhpbGVz) ). They have been
identified in the Great Salt Lake in Utah and in the Dead Sea between
Israel and Jordan, which have salt concentrations several times that of
the oceans.

**Figure 6.9**

Halophiles, like the Halobacterium shown here, require high salt

</div>

#### Thermophiles {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlcm1vcGhpbGVz_6-oez}

The **thermophiles** live in extremely hot environments. For example,
they can grow in hot springs, geysers, and near volcanoes. Unlike other
organisms, they can thrive in temperatures near 100°C, the boiling point
of water!

#### Methanogens {#6.html#x-ck12-TWV0aGFub2dlbnM._6-9td}

**Methanogens** can also live in some strange places, such as swamps and
inside the guts of cows and termites. They help these animals break down
cellulose, a tough carbohydrate made by plants ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0xMy1tZXRoYW5vZ2Vucy1jb3dz) ). This is
an example of a mutualistic relationship. Methanogens are named for
their waste product, a gas called methane.

#### Common Environments {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29tbW9uIEVudmlyb25tZW50cw.._6-k4f}

Although archaea are known for living in unusual environments, such as
the Dead Sea, inside hot springs, and in the guts of cows, they also
live in more common environments. For example, new research shows that
archaea are abundant in the soil. They also live among the plankton in
the ocean ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOC0xNC1UaGVybW9jb2NjdXMtZ2FtbWF0b2xlcmFucw..)
). Therefore, scientists are just beginning to discover some of the
important roles that archaea have in the environment.

Prokaryotes are the smallest living organisms. They were the first
organisms to evolve, and lived on this planet all by themselves for two

**Would you eat this mushroom?**

Now that's an interesting mushroom! In fact, fungi can be some of the
most colorful species. And protists can be some of the most interesting.
These two kingdoms are the first two eukaryotic kingdoms we discuss, and
they have some of the most diverse members.

But this mushroom? Probably not a good idea to eat. This is a poisonous
and psychoactive fungus. With its large, white-gilled, white-spotted,
usually deep red appearance, it is one of the most recognizable and
widely encountered mushrooms in popular culture. However, you shouldn't
eat it!

**Animal? Bacteria? Plant? Fungi? What do these figures represent?**

None of the above! These organisms may be single-celled like bacteria,
and they may look like a fungus. They also may hunt for food like an
animal or photosynthesize like a plant. And, yet, they do not fit into
any of these groups. These organisms are protists!

### What are Protists? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgUHJvdGlzdHM_-ck0}

**Protists** are **eukaryotes** , which means their cells have a nucleus
and other membrane-bound organelles. Most, but not all, protists are
single-celled. Other than these features, they have very little in
common. You can think about protists as all eukaryotic organisms that
are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi.

Although Ernst Haeckel set up the Kingdom *Protista* in 1866, this
kingdom was not accepted by the scientific world until the 1960s. These
unique organisms can be so different from each other that sometimes
Protista is called the “junk drawer" kingdom. Just like a junk drawer,
which contains items that don't fit into any other category, this
kingdom contains the eukaryotes that cannot be put into any other
kingdom. Therefore, protists can seem very different from one another.

#### Unicellular or Multicellular? {#7.html#x-ck12-VW5pY2VsbHVsYXIgb3IgTXVsdGljZWxsdWxhcj8.-nho}

Most protists are so small that they can be seen only with a microscope.
Protists are mostly unicellular (one-celled) eukaryotes. A few protists
are multicellular (many-celled) and surprisingly large. For example,
kelp is a multicellular protist that can grow to be over 100-meters long
( **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfa2VscA..) ). Multicellular
protists, however, do not show cellular specialization or
differentiation into tissues. That means their cells all look the same
and, for the most part, function the same. On the other hand, your cells
often are much different from each other and have special jobs.

#### Characteristics of Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFByb3Rpc3Rz-dg1}

A few characteristics are common between protists.

1.  They are eukaryotic, which means they have a nucleus.
2.  Most have mitochondria.
3.  They can be parasites.
4.  They all prefer aquatic or moist environments.

#### Classification of Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgUHJvdGlzdHM.-qfb}

For classification, the protists are divided into three groups:

1.  Animal-like protists, which are heterotrophs and have the ability

Protists come in many different shapes. Some are very simple, similar to
prokaryotes, and some are more complex. These simple, single-celled
protists were probably the first eukaryotes to evolve.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-p07}

-   Protists are a diverse kingdom, including all eukaryotic organisms
    that are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi.
-   For classification, the protists are divided into three groups:
    animal-like protists, plant-like protists, and fungi-like protists.

**What can photosynthesize AND hunt for food?**

No, there are no man-eating plants or leaf-growing animals. The idea of
an organism both photosynthesizing and hunting for food might seem
strange, but this isn't science fiction. These organisms, examples of
*Euglena* , are protists that can feed like an animal or use the energy
of the sun to make food like a plant.

### Protists Nutrition {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGlzdHMgTnV0cml0aW9u_1-n4d}

The cells of **protists** need to perform all of the functions that
other cells do, such as grow and reproduce, maintain homeostasis, and
obtain energy. They also need to obtain "food" to provide the energy to
perform these functions.

Recall that protists can be plant-like, fungi-like, or animal-like. That
means that protists can obtain food like plants, fungi, or animals do.
There are many plant-like protists, such as algae, that get their energy
from sunlight through photosynthesis. Some of the fungus-like protists,
such as the slime molds ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOS0wMi1zbGltZS1tb2xk) ), decompose
decaying matter. The animal-like protists must "eat" or ingest food.

Some animal-like protists use their "tails" to eat. These protists are
called **filter-feeders** . They acquire nutrients by constantly
whipping their tails, called **flagellum** , back and forth. The
whipping of the flagellum creates a current that brings food into the
protist.

Other animal-like protists must "swallow" their food through a process
called **endocytosis** . Endocytosis happens when a cell takes in
substances through its membrane. The process is described below:

1.  The protist wraps around its prey, which is usually bacteria.
2.  It creates a **food vacuole** , a sort of "food storage
    compartment," around the bacteria.
3.  The protist produces toxins which paralyze its prey.
4.  Once digested, the food material moves through the vacuole and into
    the cytoplasm of the protist.

Also, some of the animal-like and fungi-like protists are parasitic,
harming their hosts as they obtain nutrients. Fungi-like protists absorb
nutrients meant for their host, harming the host in the process.

**What can hunt prey and move, but is not an animal?**

Some protists, like these *Paramecium* , act much like animals. Notice
the tiny hair-like cilia that help them move. The food vacuoles, where
they digest their prey, are colored in orange.

### Animal-like Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsLWxpa2UgUHJvdGlzdHM._2-vmy}

Animal-like protists are called protozoa. **Protozoa** are single-celled
eukaryotes that share some traits with animals. Like animals, they can
move, and they are **heterotrophs** . That means they eat things outside
of themselves instead of producing their own food. Animal-like protists
are very small, measuring only about 0.01–0.5mm. Animal-like protists
include the flagellates, ciliates, and the sporozoans.

#### Different Kinds of Animal-like Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-RGlmZmVyZW50IEtpbmRzIG9mIEFuaW1hbC1saWtlIFByb3Rpc3Rz_2-eic}

There are many different types of animal-like protists. They are
different because they move in different ways.

-   **Flagellates** have long flagella, or tails. Flagella rotate in a
    propeller-like fashion, pushing the protist through its environment
    ( **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZmxhZ2VsbGF0ZXM.) ). An
    example of a flagellate is *Trypanosoma* , which causes African
    sleeping sickness.
-   Other protists have what are called transient **pseudopodia** ,
    which are like temporary feet. The cell surface extends out to form
    feet-like structures that propel the cell forward. An example of a
    protist with pseudopodia is the amoeba.
-   The **ciliates** are protists that move by using cilia. **Cilia**
    are thin, very small tail-like projections that extend outward from
    the cell body. Cilia beat back and forth, moving the protist along.
    *Paramecium* has cilia that propel it.
-   The **sporozoans** are protists that produce spores, such as the
    *toxoplasma* . These protists do not move at all. The spores develop
    into new protists.

**What is pond scum?**

Polluted water can form a frothy green scum on the surface. This "pond
scum" is actually a living organism, algae. The algae are plant-like
protists. Usually the algae are too small to notice, but sometimes algae
grow in excess because of the excess nutrients in polluted water.

### Plant-like Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQtbGlrZSBQcm90aXN0cw.._3-s13}

Plant-like protists are known as **algae** ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOS0wNC1yZWQtYWxnYWU.) ). They are a large
and diverse group. Plant-like protists are **autotrophs.** This means
that they produce their own food. They perform photosynthesis to produce
sugar by using carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight,
just like plants. Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists do not
have true stems, roots, or leaves.

Red algae are a very large group of protists making up about 5,000–6,000
species. They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean. Many red
algae are seaweeds and help create coral reefs.

</div>

Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes. Protists can
be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular (many-celled). Seaweed
and **kelp** are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists. Kelp
can be as large as trees and form a "forest" in the ocean ( **Figure**

**What's shrouding this dead insect?**

The thin filaments growing out of this dead insect look a little like a
fungus. Also this mystery organism, like a fungus, is feeding on
decaying matter. However, this is not a fungus. This organism is a type
of fungus-like protist, known as water mold.

### Fungus-like Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ3VzLWxpa2UgUHJvdGlzdHM._4-zar}

Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi. Like fungi, they
are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain food outside themselves. They
also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi.
Fungus-like protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at
some point in their lives. Two major types of fungus-like protists are
**slime molds** and **water molds** .

#### Slime Molds {#7.html#x-ck12-U2xpbWUgTW9sZHM._4-rqm}

Slime molds usually measure about one or two centimeters, but a few
slime molds are as big as several meters. They often have bright colors,
such as a vibrant yellow ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOS0wNS1zbGltZS1tb2xkLTI.) ). Others are
brown or white.

*Stemonitis* is a kind of slime mold which forms small brown bunches on
the outside of rotting logs. *Physarum polycephalum* lives inside
rotting logs and is a gooey mesh of yellow "threads" that are several
centimeters long. *Fuligo* , sometimes called “vomit mold,” is a yellow
slime mold found in decaying wood.

</div>

#### Water Molds {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgTW9sZHM._4-sb2}

Water molds mostly live in water or moist soil. They can be parasites of
plants and animals, getting their nutrients from these organisms and
also from decaying organisms. They are a common problem for farmers
since they cause a variety of plant diseases. One of the most famous of
these diseases was the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine in the
1800s. At this time, potatoes were the main source of food for many of
the Irish people. The failure of the potato crop meant that many people
in Ireland died of starvation or migrated to other countries.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-hpp}

-   Slime molds are fungus-like protists that grow as slimy masses on
    decaying matter. They are commonly found on items such as
    rotting logs.
-   Water molds are fungus-like protists present in moist soil and
    surface water; they live as parasites or on decaying organisms.

**Would you eat seaweed?**

Seaweed is commonly eaten in many parts of the world. It's good for you,
too; it's high in nutrients and low in calories. You have probably eaten
processed seaweed and not even known it, since it's used as a thickener
in foods like ice cream. Seaweed and other protists are also food for
many, many animals in the ecosystem.

### Importance of Protists {#7.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBQcm90aXN0cw.._5-l7o}

Humans could not live on Earth if it were not for protists. Why?
Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the oxygen on the planet
through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients
that humans need to live. All protists make up a huge part of the food
chain.

Humans use protists for many other reasons:

-   Many protists are also commonly used in medical research. For
    example, medicines made from protists are used in treatment of high
    blood pressure, digestion problems, ulcers, and arthritis.
-   Other protists are used in scientific studies. For example, slime
    molds (including *D. discoideum* , a soil-living protist) are used
    to analyze the chemical signals in cells.
-   Protists are also valuable in industry. Look on the back of a
    milk carton. You will most likely see **carrageenan** , which is
    extracted from red algae. This is used to make puddings and ice
    cream solid ( **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZWF0aW5nSWNlY3JlYW0.) ). Chemicals
    from other kinds of algae are used to produce many kinds
    of plastics.

**What does this fungus have in common with mold?**

This colorful bracket fungus doesn't look much like mold. But they have
a lot in common. They both break down organic matter to obtain
nutrients. They both reproduce by spores. They are both eukaryotic, but
they are not plants, and they are definitely not animals. They are both
fungi.

### What are Fungi? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgRnVuZ2k__6-ul2}

Ever notice blue-green mold growing on a loaf of bread? Do you like your
pizza with mushrooms? Has a physician ever prescribed an antibiotic for
you?

If so, then you have encountered **fungi** . Fungi are organisms that
belong to the Kingdom Fungi ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOS0wNy1mdW5naS1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) ). Our
environment needs fungi. Fungi help decompose matter to release
nutrients and make nutritious food for other organisms. Fungi are all
around us and are useful in many ways.

#### Classification of the Fungi {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgdGhlIEZ1bmdp_6-q5m}

If you had to guess, would you say a fungus is a plant or an animal?
Scientists used to debate about which kingdom to place fungi in. Finally
they decided that fungi were plants. But they were wrong. Now,
scientists know that fungi are not plants at all. Fungi are very
different from plants.

The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy.
Plants are **autotrophs** , meaning that they make their own "food"
using the energy from sunlight. Fungi are **heterotrophs** , which means
that they obtain their "food" from outside of themselves. In other
words, they must "eat" their food like animals do. But they don't really
eat. Instead, they absorb their nutrients.

Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi. There may
be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOS0wOC1ibHVlLWNoZWVzZQ..) ). You can
easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi
you cannot see. Fungi are either too small to be seen without a
microscope, or they live where you cannot see them easily—deep in the
soil, under decaying logs, or inside plants or animals. Some fungi even
live in, or on top of, other fungi.

#### Fungi are Good Eaters {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgYXJlIEdvb2QgRWF0ZXJz_6-bed}

Fungi can grow fast because they are such good eaters. Fungi have lots
of surface area, and this large surface area “eats” or absorbs. Surface
area is how much exposed area an organism has, compared to their overall
volume. Most of a mushroom's surface area is actually underground. If
you see a mushroom in your yard, that is just a small part of a larger
fungus growing underground.

These are the steps involved in fungi "eating":

1.  Fungi squirt special enzymes into their environment.
2.  The enzymes help digest large organic molecules, similar to cutting
    up your food before you eat.
3.  Cells of the fungi then absorb the broken-down nutrients.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-0i7}

-   Fungi are heterotrophs, meaning they obtain food from
    outside themselves.
-   Common fungi include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms.

**What killed this tree?**

Dutch elm trees used to be common, beautiful trees in the United States.
Now most of them, like this tree, have been killed by Dutch elm disease.
Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus. This is just one example of how
fungi can interact with other species.

### Symbiotic Relationships with Fungi {#7.html#x-ck12-U3ltYmlvdGljIFJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMgd2l0aCBGdW5naQ.._7-clr}

Fungi don't live in isolation. They often interact with other species.
In fact, fungi can be dependent on another organism for survival. When
two species live close together and form a relationship, it is called
**symbiosis** . Symbiosis can be beneficial to one or both organisms, or
sometimes one organism hurts the other. Some of the partners in these
relationships include plants, algae, insects and other animals, and even
humans.

#### Fungi and Plants {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgYW5kIFBsYW50cw.._7-agx}

If it were not for fungi, many plants would go hungry. In the soil,
fungi grow closely around the roots of plants, and they begin to help
each other. The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling
fungi are called **mycorrhizae** ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfcm9vdHM.) ).

As plants and fungi form a close relationship, the plant and the fungus
“feed” one another. The plant provides sugars to the fungus that the
plant makes through photosynthesis, which the fungus cannot do. The
fungus then provides minerals and water to the roots of the plant. Since
the plant and the fungus are helping each other out, this is a
**mutualistic relationship** , a type of symbiosis known as mutualism.
In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit.

**Figure 7.11**

These roots (brown) and the mycorrhizae (white) help to feed one
another.

#### Lichens {#7.html#x-ck12-TGljaGVucw.._7-fqe}

Have you ever seen an organism called a lichen? Lichens are crusty, hard
growths that you might find on trees, logs, walls, and rocks (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-ZHJ5LW1vc3MtYW5kLWxpY2hlbg..) ).
Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are
unique. A **lichen** is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a
composite organism, that live very closely together: a fungus and a
bacterium or an alga. The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside
the fungus. Besides providing a home, the fungus also provides
nutrients. In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the
fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the
sun. A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship. Because
lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life
forms in new ecosystems.

#### Fungi and Insects {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgYW5kIEluc2VjdHM._7-y6o}

Many insects have a symbiotic relationship with certain types of fungi:

-   Ants and termites grow fungi in underground “fungus gardens” that
    they create. When the ants or termites have eaten a big meal of wood
    or leaves, they also eat some fungi from their gardens. The fungi
    help them digest the wood or leaves. The fungi secrete certain
    enzymes that the ants or termites cannot produce on their own.
-   Ambrosia beetles live in the bark of trees. Like ants and termites,
    they grow fungi inside the bark of trees and use it to help digest
    their food.

#### Fungi as Parasites {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgYXMgUGFyYXNpdGVz_7-xqx}

Although lots of symbiotic relationships help both organisms, sometimes
one of the organisms is harmed. When that happens, the organism that
benefits, and is not harmed, is called a **parasite** . This type of
relationship is known as parasitism.

Examples of parasitic fungi include the following:

-   Beginning in 1950, Dutch Elm trees in the United States began
    to die. Since then, most of these trees have been eliminated. The
    disease was caused by a fungus that acted as a parasite. The fungus
    that killed the trees was carried by beetles to the trees.
-   Some parasitic fungi cause human diseases such as athlete’s foot
    and ringworm. These fungi feed on the outer layer of warm,
    moist skin. Though its name may suggest otherwise, ringworm is not
    caused by a worm, but by a fungus.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-azc}

-   Fungi can form a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic
    organisms, including plants, bacteria, and algae.
-   Fungi can also be parasites of trees and people.

**What, exactly, is a mushroom?**

Mushrooms aren't around just so you can put them on your pizza. The
mushroom is part of a large fungus that lives underground. The mushroom
develops above the ground when the fungus is ready to reproduce.

### Body Parts of Fungi {#7.html#x-ck12-Qm9keSBQYXJ0cyBvZiBGdW5naQ.._8-ubt}

The most important body parts of fungi include:

1.  Cell wall: A layer around the cell membrane of fungi cells made
    largely of chitin and other polysaccharides. It is similar to that
    found in plant cells, though the plant cell wall contains the
    polysaccharide cellulose.
2.  **Hyphae** : These are thread-like strands which interconnect and
    bunch up into a **mycelium** ( **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTEyLXBlbmNpbGxpdW0taHlwaGFl) ). Ever
    see mold on a damp wall or on old bread? The things that you are
    seeing are really mycelia. The hyphae and mycelia help the fungi
    absorb nutrients from other organisms. Most of the mycelium is
    hidden from view deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting
    matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals.
    Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other
    materials found in rotting matter, helping with the
    decaying process.
3.  Specialized structures for reproduction: One example is a
    fruiting body. Just like a fruit is involved in the reproduction of
    a fruiting plant, a fruiting body is involved in the reproduction of
    a fungus. A mushroom is a **fruiting body** , which is the part of
    the fungus that produces spores ( **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wOS0xMS1GcnVpdGluZy1ib2R5) ). The
    spores are the basic reproductive units of fungi. The mycelium
    remains hidden until it develops one or more fruiting bodies.

The fruiting bodies are usually produced at the surface of the food
source, rather than hidden within it. This allows the reproductive
spores to be easily shed and carried away by the wind, water, or
animals. The fruiting bodies are usually the only indication that a
fungus is present. Like icebergs, the fruiting bodies represent only a
tiny fraction of the whole fungus, with most of the fungus hidden from
view.

**What's this brown powder coming out of the fungus?**

This is a "puffball" fungus. At maturity, clouds of a brown dust-like
power escape when they are touched. This powdery substance is made up of
spores, the reproductive structure of the fungus.

### Reproduction in Fungi {#7.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGluIEZ1bmdp_9-ewu}

Different fungi reproduce in different ways. Many fungi reproduce both
sexually and asexually. However, some reproduce only sexually and some
only asexually. Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual
reproduction involves two parents.

#### Asexual Reproduction {#7.html#x-ck12-QXNleHVhbCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._9-sbl}

Through **asexual reproduction** , new organisms are produced that are
genetically identical to the parent. That is, they have exactly the same
DNA. Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods:

1.  **Spores** : Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create
    new fungi. This is the powdery substance released by puffballs.
    Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria,
    plants, algae, fungi, and protozoa. Theoretically, spores can
    reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring. Obviously this
    does not happen. If it did, the world would be covered by
    genetically identical fungi.
2.  Budding: The fungus grows a new part of its body, which eventually
    breaks off. The broken-off piece becomes a “new” organism (
    **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE1LWJ1ZGRpbmc.) ).
3.  Fragmentation: In this method, a piece of the mycelium, the body of
    the fungus, splits off. The resulting fragment can eventually
    produce a new colony of fungi.

**Figure 7.15**

Yeast reproduce asexually by budding.

</div>

Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual
reproduction. This form of reproduction is controlled by many different
factors. Outside conditions, such as the availability of food, determine
when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction.

#### Sexual Reproduction {#7.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._9-vag}

Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually. But why reproduce sexually when
asexual reproduction is much quicker? **Sexual reproduction** brings
together traits from the two parents. This increases the genetic
diversity of the species. In plants and animals, sexual reproduction
occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new
individual. In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and
their nuclei fuse. Instead of calling a hyphae male or female, they have
different mating types, such as (+) and (-) ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfRnVuZ2lfUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u) ).

**Figure 7.16**

The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction
when two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate, forming a mycelium with
sporangia. Notice, when the sporangia burst, the spores are released
from the fruiting body.

**What's growing on these oranges?**

Mold, of course! Did you know that mold is a type of fungus? There are
many different types of fungi besides molds, however, including
mushrooms. Mold and mushrooms are obviously different. So how are these
fungi classified?

### Fungi Classification {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgQ2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._10-adh}

Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom.
They thought this because fungi had several similarities to plants. For
example:

-   Fungi and plants have similar structures.
-   Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats, such as growing
    in soil.
-   Plants and fungi cells both have a cell wall, which animals do
    not have.

#### How Fungi and Plants Differ {#7.html#x-ck12-SG93IEZ1bmdpIGFuZCBQbGFudHMgRGlmZmVy_10-pyd}

However, there are a number of characteristics that make fungi different
from plants:

1.  Fungi cannot make their own food like plants can, since they do not
    have chloroplasts and cannot carry out photosynthesis. Fungi are
    more like animals because they are **heterotrophs,** as opposed to
    autotrophs, like plants, that make their own food. Fungi have to
    obtain their food, nutrients and glucose, from outside sources.
2.  The cell walls in many species of fungi contain chitin. **Chitin**
    is tough carbohydrate found in the shells of animals such as beetles
    and lobsters. The cell wall of a plant is made of cellulose,
    not chitin.
3.  Unlike many plants, most fungi do not have structures, such as xylem
    and phloem, that transfer water and nutrients.

#### The Types of Fungi {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFR5cGVzIG9mIEZ1bmdp_10-ofl}

The Kingdom Fungi can be broken down into several phyla. Each phyla has
some unique traits. And even within the same phyla there are many
differences among the fungi. Various types of fungi are pictured below (
**Table** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6VHlwZXNGdW5naQ..) ). Notice how
different each of these organisms are from one another.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-q0t}

-   Fungi are no longer classified as plants.
-   Although fungi have cell walls like plants, the cell walls are made
    of chitin instead of cellulose.
-   Types of fungi include molds, yeasts, and mushrooms.

**What would happen if there were no fungi?**

We'd be living in a huge trash pile! All the fallen leaves, grass
clippings, dead trees, and other organic waste would just build up.
Fungi are important decomposers in the environment. Not only do they get
rid of wastes, they make the nutrients in the wastes available to other
organisms. This is just one way that fungi are important to us.

### Fungi Roles {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgUm9sZXM._11-ilt}

Fungi are extremely important to the ecosystem because they are one of
the major decomposers of organic material. Decomposing organic material
is how fungi acquire energy. But fungi have other roles in addition to
being decomposers. How do fungi help people? They are used to help
prepare food and beverages, and they have many other uses.

#### Importance of Fungi for Human Use {#7.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBGdW5naSBmb3IgSHVtYW4gVXNl_11-y7k}

-   Yeasts are crucial for the **fermentation** process that makes beer,
    wine, and bread. Fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen and
    allows the first step of cellular respiration, glycolysis, to
    continue. 
-   Some fungi are used in the production of soy sauce and tempeh, a
    source of protein used in Southeast Asia.
-   Fungi can produce **antibiotics** , such as penicillin. Antibiotics
    are important medicines that kill bacteria, and penicillin was the
    first identified cure against many deadly bacterial species.
    Antibiotics only treat bacterial diseases; they can not be used to
    treat viral or fungal diseases.
-   Mushrooms are fungi that are eaten by people all over the globe.

#### Edible and Poisonous Fungi {#7.html#x-ck12-RWRpYmxlIGFuZCBQb2lzb25vdXMgRnVuZ2k._11-6af}

Some of the best known types of fungi are mushrooms, which can be edible
or poisonous ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-cG9pc29uLW11c2hyb29tcw..) ). Many species are
grown commercially, but others are harvested from the wild. When you
order a pizza with mushrooms or add them to your salad, you are most
likely eating *Agaricus bisporus* , known as white or button mushrooms,
the most commonly eaten species. Other mushroom species are gathered
from the wild for people to eat or for commercial sale. Many mushroom
species are poisonous to humans. Some mushrooms will simply give you a
stomachache, while others may kill you. Some mushrooms you can eat when
they are cooked but are poisonous when raw. So if you find mushrooms in
the wild, don't eat them until you are certain they are safe!

Have you ever eaten blue cheese? Do you know what makes it blue? You
guessed it. A fungus. For certain types of cheeses, producers add fungal
spores to milk curds to promote the growth of mold, which makes the
cheese blue. Molds used in cheese production are safe for humans to eat.

## Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-yod}

Protists and Fungi are two types of eukaryotic organisms. What do they
have in common? Protists are the earliest eukaryotes, and this kingdom
contains some of the simplest eukaryotes. Many are single-celled
organisms. Protists consist of animal-like, plant-like, and fungus-like
species. Protists evolved into the other three types of eukaryotes,
including fungi. Other than that, these two types of eukaryotes are very
different. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that cannot make their own
food and do not "eat." They must absorb their nutrients, usually from
decaying organisms.

**What is this?**

You may be surprised that this is a picture of plants. They look a
little like stones. In fact, these plants are often called "living
stones." Organisms don't need to have big green leaves to be considered
plants. What do you think distinguishes plants from other organisms?

### What are Plants? {#8.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgUGxhbnRzPw..-9w8}

Plants have adapted to a variety of environments, from the desert to the
tropical rain forest to lakes and oceans. In each environment, plants
have become crucial to supporting animal life. Plants are the food that
animals eat. Plants also provide places for animals, such as insects and
birds, to live; many birds build nests in plants. From tiny mosses to
gorgeous rose bushes to extremely large redwood trees ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wMS1wbGFudC1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) ), the
organisms in this kingdom, Kingdom Plantae, have three main features.
They are all:

1.  Eukaryotic.
2.  Photosynthetic.
3.  Multicellular.

Recall that **eukaryotic** organisms also include animals, protists, and
fungi. Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that contain DNA, and
membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria. **Photosynthesis** is
the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use
carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food, the
carbohydrate glucose. Plants have chloroplasts, the organelle of
photosynthesis, and are known as **producers** and **autotrophs.** Other
organisms are heterotrophic consumers, meaning they must obtain their
nutrients from another organism, as these organisms lack chloroplasts.
Lastly, plants must be multicellular, composed of more than one cell.
There are no single-celled plants. Recall that some protists, such as
algae, are eukaryotic and photosynthetic but are not considered plants.
Unlike plants, algae is mostly unicellular.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-k2h}

-   Plants are multicellular and eukaryotic, meaning their cells have a
    nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
-   Plants perform photosynthesis, the process by which plants capture
    the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air to make
    their own food.

**Where did plants come from?**

Plants have not always been around on land. For a long time, life was
confined to water. The first plants evolved from green algae that looked
somewhat like the *Chara* pictured above.

### Plants' Adaptations for Life on Land {#8.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnRzJyBBZGFwdGF0aW9ucyBmb3IgTGlmZSBvbiBMYW5k_1-igu}

The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the
water. So, where did plants come from? Evidence shows that plants
evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wMi1hbGdhZS1iZWFjaA..) ). The
similarities between green algae and plants is one piece of evidence.
They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the
same chemicals that give them color. So what separates green algae from
green plants?

![Close up of algae on a
beach](ck12_8_files/20150911113244446888.jpeg "Close up of algae on a beach")

**Figure 8.2**

The ancestor of plants is green algae. This picture shows a close up of
algae on the beach.

</div>

There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a
result, became different from algae:

1.  In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant
    after fertilization. Algae do not keep the embryo inside of
    themselves but release it into water. This was the first feature to
    evolve that separated plants from green algae. This is also the only
    adaptation shared by all plants.
2.  Over time, plants had to evolve from living in water to living
    on land. In early plants, a waxy layer called a **cuticle** evolved
    to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss. However, the
    cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the
    plant easily. Recall that the exchange of gasses—taking in carbon
    dioxide and releasing oxygen—occurs during photosynthesis.
3.  To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases, small
    pores (holes) in the leaves called **stomata** also evolved (
    **Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wMy1TdG9tYXRh) ). The
    stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions. When
    it's hot and dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of
    the plant. When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again
    to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out.
4.  A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of
    vascular tissue. **Vascular tissue** is specialized tissue that
    transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular
    tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the
    water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may
    only be found deep in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and
    nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food
    down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular
    tissues are xylem and phloem. **Xylem** is responsible for the
    transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of
    the plant. **Phloem** carries the sugars made in the leaves to the
    parts of the plant where they are needed.

**Do all plants have flowers?**

No, plants do not all have flowers. For example, the mosses and ferns
pictured here are both types of plants. However, they never produce
flowers. They don't produce seeds, either. They do, however, make tiny
spores to reproduce.

### Plant Reproduction and Life Cycle {#8.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGFuZCBMaWZlIEN5Y2xl_2-gxg}

The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an
animal. Humans are made entirely of **diploid cells** (cells with two
sets of chromosomes, referred to as ''2n''). Our only cells that are
**haploid cells** (cells with one set of chromosomes, ''n'') are sperm
and egg cells. Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage
of having haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid
chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number? If the
diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number?

Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants.
This is called **alternation of generations** , because the plant type
alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations,
the plant alternates between a **sporophyte** that has diploid cells and
a **gametophyte** that has haploid cells. 

Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four
steps: follow along in the **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wNC1hbHQtb2YtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbnMtZmVybnM.)
as you read through the steps.

1.  The haploid gametophyte produces the gametes, or sperm and egg,
    by mitosis. Remember, gametes are haploid, having one set
    of chromosomes.
2.  Then, the sperm fertilizes the egg, producing a diploid zygote that
    develops into the sporophyte, which of course, is diploid.
3.  The diploid sporophyte produces haploid **spores** by meiosis.
4.  The haploid spores go through mitosis, developing into the
    haploid gametophyte.

As we will see in additional *Plants* concepts, the generation in which
the plant spends most of its life cycle is different between various
plants. In the plants that first evolved, the gametophyte takes up the
majority of the life cycle of the plant. During the course of evolution,
the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-ktr}

-   Plants undergo alternation of generations, meaning they alternate
    between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants.
-   During the course of evolution, the sporophyte (diploid) became the
    major stage of the life cycle of the plant.

**Do all plants grow from seeds?**

No, there are actually a few plants that do not make seeds. Whether or
not a plant makes seeds is one criteria used to classify plants. How
else could you distinguish between plants?

### Plant Classification {#8.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgQ2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._3-unp}

Plants are formally divided into 12 phyla (plural for phylum), and these
phyla are gathered into four groups ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wNS1wbGFudC1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) ). These
four groups are based on the evolutionary history of significant
features in plants:

1.  **Nonvascular plants** evolved first. They are distinct from the
    algae because they keep the embryo inside of the reproductive
    structure after fertilization. These plants do not have vascular
    tissue, xylem or phloem, to transport nutrients, water, and food.
    Examples include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Without vascular
    tissue, these plants do not grow very tall.
2.  **Seedless vascular plants** evolved to have vascular tissue after
    the nonvascular plants but do not have seeds. Examples include the
    ferns, whisk ferns, club mosses, and horsetails. Vascular tissue
    allowed these plants to grow taller.
3.  **Gymnosperms** evolved to have seeds but do not have flowers.
    Examples of gymnosperms include the Redwood, Fir, and Cypress trees.
    *Gymnos* means "naked" in Greek; the seeds of gymnosperms are naked,
    not protected by flowers.
4.  Flowering plants, or **angiosperms** , evolved to have vascular
    tissue, seeds, and flowers. Examples of angiosperms include magnolia
    trees, roses, tulips, and tomatoes.

**What did forests look like millions of years ago?**

The trees you see today did not exist. Nonvascular plants and vascular
seedless plants first dominated the forest. The remains of these forests
formed the coal that we depend on today.

### Nonvascular Seedless Plants {#8.html#x-ck12-Tm9udmFzY3VsYXIgU2VlZGxlc3MgUGxhbnRz_4-qro}

**Nonvascular seedless plants** , as their name implies, lack vascular
tissue. **Vascular tissue** is specialized tissue that transports water,
nutrients, and food in plants. As they lack vascular tissue, they also
do not have true roots, stems, or leaves. Nonvascular plants do often
have a “leafy” appearance, though, and they can have stem-like and
root-like structures. These plants are very short because they cannot
move nutrients and water up a stem.

Nonvascular seedless plants, also known as **bryophytes** , are
classified into three phyla:

1.  Mosses
2.  Hornworts
3.  Liverworts

#### Mosses {#8.html#x-ck12-TW9zc2Vz_4-jm8}

**Mosses** are most often recognized as the green “fuzz” on damp rocks
and trees in a forest. If you look closely, you will see that most
mosses have tiny stem-like and leaf-like structures. This is the
gametophyte stage. Remember that a **gametophyte** is haploid, having
only one set of chromosomes. The gametophyte produces the gametes that,
after fertilization, develop into the diploid **sporophyte** with two
sets of chromosomes. The sporophyte forms a capsule, called the
**sporangium** , which releases spores ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wNy1tb3Nz) ).

#### Hornworts {#8.html#x-ck12-SG9ybndvcnRz_4-pb9}

**Hornworts** are named for their appearance. The "horn" part of the
name comes from their hornlike sporophytes, and “wort” comes from the
Anglo-Saxon word for herb. The hornlike sporophytes grow from a base of
flattened lobes, which are the gametophytes ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0wOC1ob3Jud29ydHM.) ). They usually
grow in moist and humid areas.

**How do these trees and mosses differ?**

The trees tower in the sky, while the mosses carpet the forest floor.
Mosses, like the first plants, are restricted to life near the ground
because they lack vascular system. Only with a vascular system can these
trees transport sugars, nutrients, and water up and down their tall
trunks. The evolution of the vascular system was a big step in the
evolutionary history of plants.

### Vascular Seedless Plants {#8.html#x-ck12-VmFzY3VsYXIgU2VlZGxlc3MgUGxhbnRz_5-wlj}

For these plants, the name says it all. **Vascular seedless plants**
have vascular tissue but do not have seeds. Remember that vascular
tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients
throughout the plant. The development of vascular tissue allowed these
plants to grow much taller than nonvascular plants, forming ancient
swamp forests. Most of these large vascular seedless plants are now
extinct, but their smaller relatives still remain. Vascular tissue
includes xylem, which transports water from the roots to the rest of the
plant; and phloem, which transports sugars and nutrients from the leaves
throughout the plant.

Seedless vascular plants include:

1.  Clubmosses.
2.  Ferns.
3.  Horsetails.
4.  Whisk ferns.

#### Clubmosses {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2x1Ym1vc3Nlcw.._5-o82}

**Clubmosses** are so named because they can look similar to mosses (
**Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xMC1jbHVibW9zc2Vz) ).
Clubmosses are not true mosses, though, because they have vascular
tissue. The “club” part of the name comes from club-like clusters of
sporangia found on the plants. One type of clubmoss is called the
"resurrection plant" because it shrivels and turns brown when it dries
out but then quickly turns green when watered again.

#### Ferns {#8.html#x-ck12-RmVybnM._5-hgb}

**Ferns** are the most common seedless vascular plants ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xMS1mZXJucw..) ). They usually have
large divided leaves called fronds. In most ferns, fronds develop from a
curled-up formation called a fiddlehead ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xMi1maWRkbGVoZWFk) ). The fiddlehead
looks like the curled decoration on the end of a stringed instrument,
such as a fiddle. Leaves unroll as the fiddleheads grow and expand.
Ferns grow in a variety of habitats, ranging in size from tiny aquatic
species to giant tropical plants.

#### Horsetails {#8.html#x-ck12-SG9yc2V0YWlscw.._5-d3j}

**Horsetails** have hollow, ribbed stems and are often found in marshes
( **Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xMy1ob3JzZXRhaWxz) ).
Whorls of tiny leaves around the stem make the plant look like a horse's
tail, but these soon fall off and leave a hollow stem that can perform
photosynthesis. This is unusual since photosynthesis most often occurs
in leaves. The stems are rigid and rough to the touch because they are
coated with a scratchy mineral. Because of their scratchy texture, these
plants were once used as scouring pads for cleaning dishes.

**Have you ever noticed these little capsules on moss?**

These tiny capsules produce spores. This is one stage in the process of
reproduction in the mosses. Remember mosses and other seedless plants do
not have flowers, so their life cycle is quite different from other
plants.

### Reproduction in Seedless Plants {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGluIFNlZWRsZXNzIFBsYW50cw.._6-hwd}

Seedless plants can reproduce asexually or sexually. Some seedless
plants, like hornworts and liverworts, can reproduce asexually through
fragmentation. When a small fragment of the plant is broken off, it can
form a new plant.

#### Reproduction in Nonvascular Seedless Plants {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGluIE5vbnZhc2N1bGFyIFNlZWRsZXNzIFBsYW50cw.._6-igt}

Like all plants, nonvascular plants have an **alternation of
generations** life cycle. That means they alternate between **diploid
cell** stages (having two sets of chromosomes) and **haploid cell**
stages (having one set of chromosomes) during their life cycle. Recall
the haploid stage is called the **gametophyte** , and the diploid stage
is called the **sporophyte** .

In the life cycle of the nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte
stage is the longest part of the cycle. The gametophyte is the green
photosynthetic carpet that you would recognize as a moss.

The life cycle of nonvascular seedless plants can be described as
follows:

1.  The male gametophyte produces flagellated sperm that must swim to
    the egg formed by the female gametophyte. For this reason, sexual
    reproduction must happen in the presence of water. Therefore,
    nonvascular plants tend to live in moist environments. Though the
    life of a nonvascular seedless plant is a cycle, this can be
    considered the initial step in the life cycle.
2.  Following fertilization, the sporophyte forms. The sporophyte is
    connected to, and dependent on, the gametophyte.
3.  The sporophyte produces **spores** that will develop into
    gametophytes and start the cycle over again.

#### Reproduction in Seedless Vascular Plants {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGluIFNlZWRsZXNzIFZhc2N1bGFyIFBsYW50cw.._6-kro}

For the seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte stage is the longest
part of the cycle, but the cycle is similar to nonvascular plants. For
example, in ferns, the gametophyte is a tiny heart-shaped structure,
while the leafy plant we recognize as a fern is the sporophyte.

The fern's **sporangia** , where spores are produced, are often on the
underside of the fronds ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xNS1mZXJuLXNwb3Jlcw..) ). Like
nonvascular plants, ferns also have flagellated sperm that must swim to
the egg. Unlike nonvascular plants, once fertilization takes place, the
gametophyte will die, and the sporophyte will live independently.

**Where does electricity come from?**

You probably have noticed these huge power lines delivering electricity
across the country. But how is this electricity generated? Although
there are some alternate sources like wind power and nuclear power, the
majority of electricity in the United States is generated by burning
coal. Seedless plants were central in forming the coal deposits that we
depend on.

### Importance of Seedless Plants {#8.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBTZWVkbGVzcyBQbGFudHM._7-adq}

Seedless plants have been tremendously useful to humans. Without these
plants evolving millions of years ago, life as we know it would be very
different.

#### Seedless Plants Became Coal {#8.html#x-ck12-U2VlZGxlc3MgUGxhbnRzIEJlY2FtZSBDb2Fs_7-fsx}

The greatest influence seedless plants have had on human society is in
the formation of coal millions of years ago. When the seedless plants
died, became buried deep in the Earth, and were exposed to heat and
pressure, coal formed. **Coal** is essentially made of the fossilized
carbon from these plants. Now coal is burned to provide energy, such as
electricity.

#### Current Uses {#8.html#x-ck12-Q3VycmVudCBVc2Vz_7-p2z}

But some seedless plants still have uses in society today. **Peat moss**
is commonly used by gardeners to improve soils, since it is really good
at absorbing and holding water ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xNi1wZWF0LW1vc3M.) ).

Depending on the location, ferns have several different uses worldwide.
Ferns are found in many gardens as ornaments, and are used as indoor
plants. In tropical regions, the fern is used as a food source by many
locals. The fronds can also be used to weave hats and baskets. The
fiddleheads of certain species of ferns are used in gourmet food. Some
species of ferns, such as the maidenhair fern, are used as medicines. In
Southeast Asia, the fern is used in rice fields as a biological
fertilizer. Much of the world’s fossil fuels consist of remains of ferns
and their relatives.

The horsetail’s reedy exterior and silica content made it popular as a
metal polisher and abrasive cleanser. Herbalists still use horsetail to
treat a variety of kidney/bladder problems, including inflammation,
infection, and kidney stones, and it is used as a remedy for brittle
nails. Club moss is also used to treat kidney ailments and digestive
problems. Club moss spores can be dusted onto the skin and provide
relief from itching and irritation, and provide the skin with
protection. Extinct forests of club moss have fossilized and developed
into huge beds of coal.

**Why are seeds important?**

Many important crops, such as corn, are planted and harvested as seeds.
These seeds are important sources of food. For example, corn is ground
into feed for chickens and cows. And corn syrup is used to sweeten
beverages and candy. But most importantly, seeds are the starting point
for a new plant.

### Seeds and Seed Dispersal {#8.html#x-ck12-U2VlZHMgYW5kIFNlZWQgRGlzcGVyc2Fs_8-fhj}

Plants seem to grow wherever they can. How? Plants can't move on their
own. So how does a plant start growing in a new area?

#### What is a Seed? {#8.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIFNlZWQ__8-cze}

If you’ve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed, then you might
realize that seeds are amazing structures. A **seed** is a plant ovule
containing an embryo. The seed allows a plant embryo to survive
droughts, harsh winters, and other conditions that would kill an adult
plant. The tiny plant embryo can simply stay **dormant** , in a resting
state, and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow. In fact,
some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years!

Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the
young plant after it sprouts. This greatly increases the chances that
the tiny plant will survive. So being able to produce a seed is a
beneficial adaptation, and, as a result, seed plants have been very
successful. Although the seedless plants were here on Earth first, today
there are many more seed plants than seedless plants.

#### How are Seed Plants Successful? {#8.html#x-ck12-SG93IGFyZSBTZWVkIFBsYW50cyBTdWNjZXNzZnVsPw.._8-wgb}

For a seed plant species to be successful, the seeds must be
**dispersed** , or scattered around in various directions. If the seeds
are spread out in many different areas, there is a better chance that
some of the seeds will find the right conditions to grow. But how do
seeds travel to places they have never been before? To aid with seed
dispersal, some plants have evolved special features that help their
seeds travel over long distances.

One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds. With special
adaptations in the seeds, the seeds can be carried long distances by the
wind. For example, you might have noticed how the "fluff" of a dandelion
moves in the wind. Each piece of fluff carries a seed to a new location.
If you look under the scales of pine cone, you will see tiny seeds with
"wings" that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind. Maple
trees also have specialized fruits with wing-like parts that help seed
dispersal ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xNy1tYXBsZS13aW5nZWQtZnJ1aXRz) ).

**Figure 8.17**

Maple trees have fruits with “wings” that help the wind disperse the
seeds.

</div>

Some flowering plants grow fleshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds.
When animals eat the fruit, the seeds pass through an animal’s digestive
tract unharmed. The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the
animal's feces. Berries, citrus fruits, cherries, apples, and a variety
of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals, so
the animals will eat them and disperse the seed ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xOC1mbGVzaHktZnJ1aXRz) ). Some
non-fleshy fruits are specially adapted for animals to carry them on
their fur. You might have returned from a walk in the woods to find
burrs stuck to your socks. These burrs are actually specialized fruits
designed to carry seeds to a new location.

**What does "gymnasium" mean?**

Today a gymnasium means a place for playing indoor sports. In ancient
Greece, sports were done in the nude, so the word "gymnasium" is based
on the Greek word for naked (gymnos). The root word is the same for
"gymnosperm," which means "naked seed." Gymnosperms are those plants
that do not have a fruit encasing the seed.

### Gymnosperms {#8.html#x-ck12-R3ltbm9zcGVybXM._9-wcl}

Gymnosperms have seeds, but they do not produce fruit. Instead, the
seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones.

There are four phyla of gymnosperms:

1.  Conifers
2.  Cycads
3.  Ginkgoes
4.  Gnetophytes

#### Conifers {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29uaWZlcnM._9-pt3}

**Conifers** , members of the phylum *Coniferophyta* , are probably the
gymnosperms that are most familiar to you. Conifers include trees such
as pines, firs, spruces, cedars, and the coastal redwood trees in
California, which are the tallest living vascular plants.

Conifers have their reproductive structures in cones, but they are not
the only plants to have that trait ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0xOS1yZWQtcGluZQ..) ). Conifer pollen
cones are usually very small, while the seed cones are larger.
**Pollen** contains gametophytes that produce the male gamete of seed
plants. The pollen, which is a powder-like substance, is carried by the
wind to fertilize the seed cones that contain the female gamete (
**Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yMC1waW5lLWNvbmVz) ).

**Figure 8.20**

</div>

Conifers have many uses. They are important sources of lumber and are
also used to make paper. Resins, the sticky substance you might see
oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, are collected from conifers to
make a variety of products, such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin
used by musicians and baseball players. The sticky rosin improves the
pitcher’s hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and
the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed
instrument.

#### Cycads {#8.html#x-ck12-Q3ljYWRz_9-8ci}

**Cycads** , in the phylum *Cycadophyta* , are also gymnosperms. They
have large, finely-divided leaves and grow as short shrubs and trees in
tropical regions. Like conifers, they produce cones, but the seed cones
and pollen cones are always on separate plants ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yMS1jeWNhZHM.) ). One type of cycad,
the Sago Palm, is a popular landscape plant. During the Age of the
Dinosaurs (about 65 to 200 million years ago), cycads were the dominant
plants. So you can imagine dinosaurs grazing on cycad seeds and roaming
through cycad forests.

**Figure 8.21**

Cycads bear their pollen and seeds in cones on separate plants.

</div>

#### Ginkgoes {#8.html#x-ck12-R2lua2dvZXM._9-0rv}

**Ginkgoes** , in the phylum *Ginkgophyta* , are unique because they are
the only species left in the phylum. Many other species in the fossil
record have gone extinct ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yMi1naW5rb2Vz) ). The ginkgo tree is
sometimes called a "living fossil" because it is the last species from
its phylum.

One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often
grown around Buddhist temples, especially in China. The ginkgo tree is
also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can
live in polluted areas better than most plants.

Ginkgoes, like cycads, has separate female and male plants. The male
trees are usually preferred for landscaping because the seeds produced
by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen.

Ginkgo trees are gymnosperms with broad leaves.

</div>

#### Gnetophytes {#8.html#x-ck12-R25ldG9waHl0ZXM._9-ohr}

**Gnetophytes** , in the phylum *Gnetophyta* , are a very small and
unusual group of plants. *Ephedra* is an important member of this group,
since this desert shrub produces the ephedrine used to treat asthma and
other conditions. *Welwitschia* produces extremely long leaves and is
found in the deserts of southwestern Africa ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yMy13ZWx3aXRzY2hpYS1nbmV0b3BoeXRl) ).
Overall, there are about 70 different species in this diverse phylum.

**Why do plants make fruit?**

When this bird eats a berry, it also consumes the seeds contained
inside. The bird may fly for many miles before digestion is complete and
the seeds are excreted. This allows the plant to spread its seeds to a
new location. For this reason, plants that make fruits have been very
successful.

### Angiosperms {#8.html#x-ck12-QW5naW9zcGVybXM._10-aoq}

**Angiosperms** , in the phylum *Anthophyta* , are the most successful
phylum of plants. This category also contains the largest number of
individual plants ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yNC1hbmdpb3NwZXJtcw..) ). Angiosperms
evolved the structure of the flower, so they are also called the
flowering plants. Angiosperms live in a variety of different
environments. A water lily, an oak tree, and a barrel cactus, although
different, are all angiosperms.

#### The Parts of a Flower {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBhcnRzIG9mIGEgRmxvd2Vy_10-c1g}

have some structures in common. The structures are explained in the

**Figure 8.25**

A complete flower has sepals, petals, stamens, and one or more carpels.

</div>

-   The green outside of a flower that often looks like a leaf is called
    the **sepal** ( **Figure**
    [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yNi1wZXRhbHNlcGFs) ). All of the
    sepals together are called the **calyx** , which is usually green
    and protects the flower before it opens.
-   All of the petals ( **Figure**
    [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yNi1wZXRhbHNlcGFs) ) together are
    called the **corolla** . They are bright and colorful to attract a
    particular **pollinator** , an animal that carries pollen from one
    flower to another. Examples of pollinators include birds
    and insects.
-   The next structure is the **stamen** , consisting of the stalk-like
    **filament** that holds up the **anther** , or pollen sac. The
    **pollen,** which is found at the top of the stamen, is the
    male gametophyte.
-   At the very center is the **carpel,** which is divided into three
    different parts: (1) the sticky **stigma** , where the pollen
    lands, (2) the tube of the **style** , and (3) the large, bottom
    part, known as the **ovary** .

The ovary holds the **ovules** , the female gametophytes. When the
ovules are fertilized, the ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes
the fruit.

#### How Do Angiosperms Reproduce? {#8.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvIEFuZ2lvc3Blcm1zIFJlcHJvZHVjZT8._10-ljk}

Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways:

1.  Self-pollination: Pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower.
    This way, a seed will be produced that can turn into a genetically
    identical plant.
2.  Cross-fertilization: Pollen from one flower travels to a stigma of a
    flower on another plant. Pollen travels from flower to flower by
    wind or by animals. Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as
    birds, butterflies, or bees are often colorful and provide nectar, a
    sugary reward, for their animal pollinators.

#### Why Are Angiosperms Important to Humans? {#8.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEFyZSBBbmdpb3NwZXJtcyBJbXBvcnRhbnQgdG8gSHVtYW5zPw.._10-p2q}

Angiosperms are important to humans in many ways, but the most
significant role of angiosperms is as food. Wheat, rye, corn, and other
grains are all harvested from flowering plants. Starchy foods, such as
potatoes, and legumes, such as beans, are also angiosperms. And, as
mentioned previously, fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase
seed dispersal and are nutritious.

There are also many non-food uses of angiosperms that are important to
society. For example, cotton and other plants are used to make cloth,
and hardwood trees are used for lumber.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-sf7}

-   Angiosperms are plants that produce flowers and fruit.
-   Angiosperms can be self-pollinated, meaning pollen falls on the
    stigma of the same flower, or cross-fertilized, during which pollen
    from one flower travels to a stigma of a flower on another plant.

**How do fruits know when to fall?**

Fruits, such as these peaches, do not leave their trees until it's the
right time. The seeds are mature, and the fruit is ripe. But what tells
the fruits it's time to drop? The signal that is sent through the tree
is a type of hormone. Hormones also send signals through your body.

### Plant Hormones {#8.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgSG9ybW9uZXM._11-bjg}

Plants may not move, but that does not mean they don't respond to their
environment. Plants can sense gravity, light, touch, and seasonal
changes. For example, you might have noticed how a house plant bends
toward a bright window. Plants can sense and then grow toward the source
of light. Scientists say that plants are able to respond to "stimuli,"
or something—usually in the environment—that results in a response. For
instance, light is the stimulus, and the plant moving toward the light
is the "response."

**Hormones** are special chemical messengers molecules that help
organisms, including plants, respond to stimuli in their environment. In
order for plants to respond to the environment, their cells must be able
to communicate with other cells. Hormones send messages between the
cells. Animals, like humans, also have hormones, such as testosterone or
estrogen, to carry messages from cell to cell. In both plants and
animals, hormones travel from cell to cell in response to a stimulus;
they also activate a specific response.

#### Types of Plant Hormones {#8.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUGxhbnQgSG9ybW9uZXM._11-kfp}

Five different types of plant hormones are involved in the main
responses of plants, and they each have different functions ( **Table**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cGxhbnQtaG9ybW9uZXM.) ).

  **Hormone**     **Function**
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  Ethylene        Fruit ripening and abscission
  Gibberellins    Break the dormancy of seeds and buds; promote growth
  Cytokinins      Promote cell division; prevent senescence
  Abscisic Acid   Close the stomata; maintain dormancy
  Auxins          Involved in tropisms and apical dominance

#### Ethylene {#8.html#x-ck12-RXRoeWxlbmU._11-uar}

The hormone **ethylene** has two functions. It (1) helps ripen fruit and
(2) is involved in the process of **abscission** , the dropping of
leaves, fruits, and flowers. When a flower is done blooming or a fruit
is ripe and ready to be eaten, ethylene causes the petals or fruit to
fall from a plant ( **Figure**

Ethylene is an unusual plant hormone because it is a gas. That means it
can move through the air, and a ripening apple can cause another apple
to ripen, or even over-ripen. That’s why one rotten apple spoils the
whole barrel! Some farmers spray their green peppers with ethylene gas
to cause them to ripen faster and become red peppers.

You can try to see how ethylene works by putting a ripe apple or banana
with another unripe fruit in a closed container or paper bag. What do
you think will happen to the unripe fruit?

#### Gibberellins {#8.html#x-ck12-R2liYmVyZWxsaW5z_11-tn3}

**Gibberellins** are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When
gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer.
Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase
the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand,
have low levels of gibberellins ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0yOS1ib25zYWk.) ). Another function of
gibberellins is to stop **dormancy** (resting time) of seeds and buds.
Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to **germinate** (sprout)
or for a bud to open.

#### Cytokinins {#8.html#x-ck12-Q3l0b2tpbmlucw.._11-e2p}

**Cytokinins** are hormones that cause plant cells to divide. Cytokinins
were discovered from attempts to grow plant tissue in artificial
environments ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0zMC1jeXRva2luaW5z) ). Cytokinins
prevent the process of aging (senescence). So florists sometimes apply
cytokinins to cut flowers, so they do not get old and die.

#### Abscisic Acid {#8.html#x-ck12-QWJzY2lzaWMgQWNpZA.._11-ag7}

**Abscisic acid** is misnamed because it was once believed to play a
role in abscission (the dropping of leaves, fruits, and flowers), but we
now know abscission is caused by ethylene. The actual role of abscisic
acid is to close the stomata, the tiny openings in leaves that allow
substances to enter and leave, and to maintain dormancy. When a plant is
stressed due to lack of water, abscisic acid tells the stomata to close.
This prevents water loss through the stomata.

When the environment is not good for a seed to germinate, abscisic acid
signals for the dormancy period of the seed to continue. Abscisic acid
also tells the buds of plants to stay in the dormancy stage. When
conditions improve, the levels of abscisic acid drop and the levels of
gibberellins increase, signaling that is time to break dormancy (
**Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0zMS1idWRzLXB1dC1sZWF2ZXM.)
).

#### Auxins {#8.html#x-ck12-QXV4aW5z_11-f63}

**Auxins** are hormones that play a role in plant growth. Auxins
produced at the tip of the plant are involved in **apical dominance** ,
when the main central stem grows more strongly than other stems and
branches. When the tip of the plant is removed, the auxins are no longer
present, and the side branches begin to grow. This is why pruning a
plant by cutting off the main branches helps produce a fuller plant with
more branches. You actually need to cut branches off of a plant for it
to grow more branches! Auxins are also involved in tropisms, responses
to stimuli in the environment

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-5nq}

**Why are these plants turning sideways?**

Plants respond to their environment in how they grow. In this picture,
the light source is probably off to the left side. As a result, the
plants grow in this direction to get more light.

### Tropisms {#8.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGlzbXM._12-lsk}

Plants may not be able to move to another location, but they are able to
change how they grow in response to their environment. Growth toward or
away from a stimulus is known as a **tropism** ( **Table**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dHJvcGlzbXM.) ). Auxins, a class of plant
hormones, allow plants to curve in specific directions as they grow. The
auxin moves to one side of the stem, where it starts a chain of events
that cause rapid cell growth on just that one side of the stem. With one
side of the stem growing faster than the other, the plant begins to
bend.

  **Name**        **Stimulus**
  --------------- --------------
  Phototropism    Light
  Gravitropism    Gravity
  Thigmotropism   Touch

#### Phototropism {#8.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG90cm9waXNt_12-l7x}

You might have noticed that plants bend toward the light. This is an
example of a tropism where light is the stimulus, known as
**phototropism** ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0zMi1waG90b3Ryb3Bpc20.) ). To obtain
more light for photosynthesis, leaves and stems grow toward the light.
On the other hand, roots grow away from light. This is beneficial for
the roots, because they need to obtain water and nutrients from deep
within the ground.

#### Gravitropism {#8.html#x-ck12-R3Jhdml0cm9waXNt_12-1zs}

So, how do the roots of seeds underground know to grow downward? How do
the roots deep in the soil know which way is up? **Gravitropism** is a
growth toward or away from the pull of gravity ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0zMy1HcmF2aXRyb3Bpc20.) ). **Shoots** ,
the new growth of a plant, also show a gravitropism, but in the opposite
direction. If you place a plant on its side, the stem and new leaves
will curve upward.

#### Thigmotropism {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhpZ21vdHJvcGlzbQ.._12-bvl}

Plants also have a touch response called **thigmotropism** . If you have
ever seen a morning glory or the tendrils of a pea plant twist around a
pole, then you know that plants must be able to sense the pole.
Thigmotropism works much like the other tropisms. The plant grows
straight until it comes in contact with the pole. Then, the side of the
stem that is in contact with the pole grows slower than the opposite
side of the stem. This causes the stem to bend around the pole.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-gxn}

-   Tropisms are growth toward or away from a stimulus.
-   Types of tropisms include gravitropism (gravity), phototropism
    (light), and thigmotropism (touch).

**How does this plant know it's Christmas?**

This plant is known as a Christmas cactus because it only blooms once a
year, during the Christmas season. But plants can't read a calendar. How
can a houseplant know the time of the year?

### Seasonal Changes {#8.html#x-ck12-U2Vhc29uYWwgQ2hhbmdlcw.._13-x1u}

Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors? During what time of
year does this happen? What causes it to happen? Plants can sense
changes in the **seasons** . Leaves change color and drop each autumn in
some climates ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMC0zNC1sZWF2ZXMtY2hhbmdlLWNvbG9y) ).

Leaves changing color is a response to the shortened length of the day

</div>

Certain flowers, like poinsettias, only bloom during the winter. And, in
the spring, the winter buds on the trees break open, and the leaves
start to grow. How do plants detect time of year?

Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature,
this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing.
Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight, known as
the photoperiod. Because of the tilt of the Earth, during winter days,
there are less hours of light than during summer days. That’s why, in
the winter, it starts getting dark very early in the evening, and then
stays dark while you’re getting ready for school the next morning. But
in the summer it will be bright early in the morning, and the sun will
not set until late that night. With a light-sensitive chemical, plants
can sense the differences in day length.

For example, in the fall, when the days start to get shorter, the trees
sense that there is less sunlight. The plant is stimulated, and it sends
messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall. This is an
example of **photoperiodism** , the reaction of organisms, such as
plants, to the length of day or night. Photoperiodism is also the
reaction of plants to the length of light and dark periods. Many
flowering plants sense the length of night, a dark period, as a signal
to flower. Each plant has a different photoperiod, or night length. When
the plant senses the appropriate length of darkness, resulting in an
appropriate length of daylight, it flowers. Flowering plants are
classified as long-day plants or short-day plants. Long-day plants
flower when the length of daylight exceeds the necessary photoperiod,
and short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than the
necessary photoperiod. Long-day plants include carnations, clover,
lettuce, wheat, and turnips. Short-day plants include cotton, rice, and
sugar cane.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-brn}

-   Plants can respond to the change of season by losing their leaves,
    flowering, or breaking dormancy.
-   Plants go through seasonal changes after detecting differences in
    day length.

The Kingdom Plantae ranges from small nonvascular plants to towering
redwood trees. It is probable that without plants, most life, including
us, would not exist. Why? Photosynthesis. This process brings energy
into our ecosystems and produces the oxygen that all of our cells need.
This concept discusses the types of plants, the structures of plants,
reproduction of plants, and the adaptations and responses of plants.

**Fighting or playing?**

You might think that these young tigers are fighting, but they’re really
just playing. Like most other young mammals, tigers like to play. Why do
mammals play? Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other
purpose as well? Playing is actually an important way of learning. By
playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them become
successful predators as adults. Playing is just one of many ways that
mammals and other animals learn how to behave.

**Why do spiders spin webs?**

You have probably seen a spider web before. You may even know that
spiders create webs to catch their prey. This is an example of animal
behavior. Animals have many different behaviors.

### Introduction to Animal Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIEFuaW1hbCBCZWhhdmlvcg..-w2q}

Barking, purring, and playing are just some of the ways in which dogs
and cats behave. These are examples of animal behaviors. **Animal
behavior** is any way that animals act, either alone or with other
animals.

#### Examples of Animal Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgQW5pbWFsIEJlaGF2aW9y-tme}

Can you think of examples of animal behaviors? What about insects and
birds? How do they behave? Pictured below are just some of the ways in
which these, and other animals act ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-YW5pbWFsX2JlaGF2aW9ycw..) ). Look at the pictures
and read about the behaviors. Think about why the animal is behaving
that way.

**Figure 9.1**

These pictures show examples of animal behaviors. Why do the animals
behave these ways?

</div>

#### Importance of Animal Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBBbmltYWwgQmVoYXZpb3I.-nnj}

Why do animals behave the way they do? The answer to this question
depends on what the behavior is. A cat chases a mouse to catch it. A
mother dog nurses her puppies to feed them. All of these behaviors have
the same purpose: getting or providing food. All animals need food for
energy. They need energy to move around. In fact, they need energy just
to stay alive. Energy allows all the processes inside cells to occur.
Baby animals also need energy to grow and develop.

Birds and wasps build nests to have a safe place to store their eggs and
raise their young. Many other animals build nests for the same reason.
Animals protect their young in other ways, as well. For example, a
mother dog not only nurses her puppies. She also washes them with her
tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals. All of
these behaviors help the young survive and grow up to be adults.

Rabbits run away from foxes and other predators to stay alive. Their
speed is their best defense. Lizards sun themselves on rocks to get warm
because they cannot produce their own body heat. When they are warmer,
they can move faster and be more alert. This helps them escape from
predators and also find food.

All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get
food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they,
themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive,
increase the animals’ **fitness.** Animals with higher fitness have a
better chance of passing their **genes** on to the next generation. If
genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more
common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by
natural selection.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-lqf}

-   Animal behavior is any way that animals act, either alone or with
    other animals.
-   Animal behavior may be aimed at getting food for energy, making sure
    their young survive, or ensuring that they, themselves, survive.

**Do you play a sport?**

If you play a sport like soccer, then you realize it takes a lot of
work. Remember how you didn't know at all what you were doing when you
first started? You had rules to figure out and skills to practice.
Playing a sport is an example of a learned behavior.

### Learned Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5lZCBCZWhhdmlvcg.._1-uz0}

Just about all human behaviors are learned. **Learned behavior** is
behavior that occurs only after experience or practice. Learned behavior
has an advantage over **innate behavior** : it is more flexible. Learned
behavior can be changed if conditions change. For example, you probably
know the route from your house to your school. Assume that you moved to
a new house in a different place, so you had to take a different route
to school. What if following the old route was an innate behavior? You
would not be able to adapt. Fortunately, it is a learned behavior. You
can learn the new route just as you learned the old one.

Although most animals can learn, animals with greater intelligence are
better at learning and have more learned behaviors. Humans are the most
intelligent animals. They depend on learned behaviors more than any
other species. Other highly intelligent species include apes, our
closest relatives in the animal kingdom. They include chimpanzees and
gorillas. Both are also very good at learning behaviors.

You may have heard of a gorilla named Koko. The psychologist, Dr.
Francine Patterson, raised Koko. Dr. Patterson wanted to find out if
gorillas could learn human language. Starting when Koko was just one
year old, Dr. Patterson taught her to use sign language. Koko learned to
use and understand more than 1,000 signs. Koko showed how much gorillas
can learn. See *A Conversation with Koko* at
[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/koko](koko) .

Think about some of the behaviors you have learned. They might include
riding a bicycle, using a computer, and playing a musical instrument or
sport. You probably did not learn all of these behaviors in the same
way. Perhaps you learned some behaviors on your own, just by practicing.
Other behaviors you may have learned from other people. Humans and other
animals can learn behaviors in several different ways.

The following methods of learning will be explored below:

1.  Habituation (forming a habit)
2.  Observational learning
3.  Conditioning
4.  Play
5.  Insight learning

#### Habituation {#9.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXR1YXRpb24._1-mag}

**Habituation** is learning to get used to something after being exposed
to it for a while. Habituation usually involves getting used to
something that is annoying or frightening, but not dangerous.
Habituation is one of the simplest ways of learning. It occurs in just
about every species of animal.

You have probably learned through habituation many times. For example,
maybe you were reading a book when someone turned on a television in the
same room. At first, the sound of the television may have been annoying.
After a while, you may no longer have noticed it. If so, you had become
habituated to the sound.

Another example of habituation is shown below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xMy1zY2FyZWNyb3c.) ). Crows and most
other birds are usually afraid of people. They avoid coming close to
people, or they fly away when people come near them. The crows landing
on this scarecrow have become used to a “human” in this place. They have
learned that the scarecrow poses no danger. They are no longer afraid to
come close. They have become habituated to the scarecrow.

![A crow that has habituated to a
scarecrow](ck12_9_files/20150911113328607777.jpeg "A crow that has habituated to a scarecrow")

**Figure 9.2**

This scarecrow is no longer scary to this crow. The crow has become used
to its being in this spot and learned that it is not dangerous. This is
an example of habituation.

</div>

Can you see why habituation is useful? It lets animals ignore things
that will not harm them. Without habituation, animals might waste time
and energy trying to escape from things that are not really dangerous.

#### Observational Learning {#9.html#x-ck12-T2JzZXJ2YXRpb25hbCBMZWFybmluZw.._1-ba6}

**Observational learning** is learning by watching and copying the
behavior of someone else. Human children learn many behaviors this way.
When you were a young child, you may have learned how to tie your shoes
by watching your dad tie his shoes. More recently, you may have learned
how to dance by watching a pop star dancing on TV. Most likely, you have
learned how to do math problems by watching your teachers do problems on
the board at school. Can you think of other behaviors you have learned
by watching and copying other people?

Other animals also learn through observational learning. For example,
young wolves learn to be better hunters by watching and copying the
skills of older wolves in their pack. Another example of observational
learning is how some monkeys have learned to wash their food. They
learned by watching and copying the behavior of other monkeys.

#### Conditioning {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29uZGl0aW9uaW5n_1-jqf}

**Conditioning** is a way of learning that involves a reward or
punishment. Did you ever train a dog to fetch a ball or stick by
rewarding it with treats? If you did, you were using conditioning.
Another example of conditioning is shown in the video below; the rats
have been taught to “play basketball” by being rewarded with food
pellets. What do you think would happen if the rats were no longer
rewarded for this behavior?

[![](ck12_9_files/tmphgYXvf.jpeg)](jAQSEO25fa4%3Fwmode%3Dtransparent%26rel%3D0%26hash%3Dd1c66f78c5c6810ff27bfd316abf53f5)

Click on the image above for more content

Conditioning also occurs in wild animals. For example, bees learn to
find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar
in those flowers before.

Humans learn behaviors through conditioning, as well. A young child
might learn to put away his toys by being rewarded with a bedtime story.
An older child might learn to study for tests in school by being
rewarded with better grades. Can you think of behaviors you have learned
by being rewarded for them?

Conditioning does not always involve a reward. It can involve a
punishment, instead. A toddler might be punished with a time-out each
time he grabs a toy from his baby brother. After several time-outs, he
may learn to stop taking his brother’s toys.

A dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa. After
repeated scolding, she may learn to stay off the sofa. A bird might
become ill after eating a poisonous insect. The bird may learn from this
“punishment” to avoid eating the same kind of insect in the future.

#### Learning by Playing {#9.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5pbmcgYnkgUGxheWluZw.._1-b70}

Most young mammals, including humans, like to play. Play is one ways
they learn the skills that they will need as adults. Think about how
kittens play. They pounce on toys and chase each other. This helps them
learn how to be better predators when they are older. Big cats also
play. The lion cubs pictured below are playing and practicing their
hunting skills at the same time ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDgtMDItMDQtcGxheWluZw..) ). The dogs are
playing tug-of-war with a toy ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMDgtMDItMDQtcGxheWluZw..) ). What do you
think they are learning by playing together this way?

Other young animals play in different ways. For example, young deer play
by running and kicking up their hooves. This helps them learn how to
escape from predators.

Left: These two lion cubs are playing. They are not only having fun, but
they are also learning how to be better hunters. Right: These dogs are
really playing. This play fighting can help them learn how to be better

</div>

Human children learn by playing as well. For example, playing games and
sports can help them learn to follow rules and work with others. The
toddlers pictured below are playing in the sand ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xNy1TYW5kLUJveA..) ). They are
learning about the world through play. What do you think they might be
learning?

learn about the world.

#### Insight Learning {#9.html#x-ck12-SW5zaWdodCBMZWFybmluZw.._1-0i3}

**Insight learning** is learning from past experiences and reasoning. It
usually involves coming up with new ways to solve problems. Insight
learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden flash of
insight. Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human
beings use insight learning more than any other species. They have used
their intelligence to solve problems ranging from inventing the wheel to
flying rockets into space.

Think about problems you have solved. Maybe you figured out how to solve
a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video
game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it,
then you were using insight learning.

One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems.
Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent
enough to make tools. In fact, tool-making was believed to set humans
apart from all other animals.

In 1960, primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also
make tools. She saw a chimpanzee strip leaves from a twig. Then he poked
the twig into a hole in a termite mound. After termites climbed onto the
twig, he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to
it. The chimpanzee had made a tool to “fish” for termites. He had used
insight to solve a problem. Since then, chimpanzees have been seen
making several different types of tools. For example, they sharpen
sticks and use them as spears for hunting. They use stones as hammers to
crack open nuts.

Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to
solve problems. A crow was seen bending a piece of wire into a hook.
Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube.

An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xOS1nb3JpbGxhLXRvb2wtdXNl)
). Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals can use
their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through
insight.

**How do kittens know how to "hunt"?**

This kitten was probably adopted and separated from its mother at a
young age. It never got a lesson in how to stalk and pounce on prey. So
how does this kitten know how to attack the ball of yarn? Some behaviors
do not need to be learned.

### Innate Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-SW5uYXRlIEJlaGF2aW9y_2-h2n}

Many animal behaviors are ways that animals act, naturally. They don’t
have to learn how to behave in these ways. Cats are natural-born
hunters. They don’t need to learn how to hunt. Spiders spin their
complex webs without learning how to do it from other spiders. Birds and
wasps know how to build nests without being taught. These behaviors are
called innate.

An **innate behavior** is any behavior that occurs naturally in all
animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also called an
**instinct** . The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the
animal does it well. The animal does not have to practice the behavior
in order to get it right or become better at it. Innate behaviors are
also predictable. All members of a species perform an innate behavior in
the same way. From the examples described above, you can probably tell
that innate behaviors usually involve important actions, like eating and
caring for the young.

There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you
know that honeybees dance? The honeybee pictured below has found a
source of food ( **Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0wOC1CZWU.)
). When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance. This dance is
called the **waggle dance** . The way the bee moves during its dance
tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do
the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate
behavior.

**Figure 9.6**

When this honeybee goes back to its hive, it will do a dance to tell the

</div>

Besides building nests, birds have other innate behaviors. One example
occurs in gulls, which are pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMTUtMDktR2FwaW5n) ); one of the chicks is
pecking at a red spot on the mother’s beak. This innate behavior causes
the mother to feed the chick. In many other species of birds, the chicks
open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to the nest (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtTFMtMTUtMDktR2FwaW5n) ). This

Left: This mother gull will feed her chick after it pecks at a red spot
on her beak. Both pecking and feeding behaviors are innate. Right: When
these baby birds open their mouths wide, their mother instinctively
feeds them. This innate behavior is called gaping.

</div>

Another example of innate behavior in birds is egg rolling. It happens
in some species of water birds, like the graylag goose ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xMS1HcmF5bGFnLWdvb3Nl) ). Graylag
geese make nests on the ground. If an egg rolls out of the nest, a
mother goose uses her bill to push it back into the nest. Returning the
egg to the nest helps ensure that the egg will hatch.

**Figure 9.8**

This female graylag goose is a ground-nesting water bird. Before her
chicks hatch, the mother protects the eggs. She will use her bill to
push eggs back into the nest if they roll out. This is an example of an
innate behavior. How could this behavior increase the goose’s fitness?

#### Innate Behavior in Human Beings {#9.html#x-ck12-SW5uYXRlIEJlaGF2aW9y_2IGluIEh1bWFuIEJlaW5ncw..-ion}

All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of
human behaviors that do not have to be learned? Chances are, you will
have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in
humans are called **reflex behaviors** . They occur mainly in babies.
Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies
may help them survive.

An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex.
Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth.
It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of
a baby feeding and surviving. Another example of a reflex behavior in
babies is the grasp reflex ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xMi1odW1hbi1iYWJ5LWdyYXNw) ). Babies
instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their
grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior might
increase a baby’s chances of surviving?

**How do monkeys communicate?**

You won't find a monkey texting a friend. They make noises. They make
faces. They even use scents to pass along a message. Just because
monkeys don't talk like you and me doesn't mean that they don't
communicate!

### Communication {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbg.._3-1xk}

What does the word "communication" make you think of? Talking on a cell
phone? Texting? Writing? Those are just a few of the ways in which human
beings communicate. Most other animals also communicate.
**Communication** is any way in which animals share information, and
they do this in many different ways.

Do all animals talk to each other? Probably not, but many do
communicate. Like human beings, many other animals live together in
groups. Some insects, including ants and bees, are well known for living
in groups. In order for animals to live together in groups, they must be
able to communicate with each other.

Animal communication, like most other animal behaviors, increases the
ability to survive and have offspring. This is known as fitness.
Communication increases fitness by helping animals find food, defend
themselves from predators, mate, and care for offspring.

#### Communication with Sound {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbiB3aXRoIFNvdW5k_3-1n3}

Some animals communicate with sound. Most birds communicate this way.
Birds use different calls to warn other birds of danger, or to tell them
to flock together. Many other animals also use sound to communicate. For
example, monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop
that a predator is near. Frogs croak to attract female frogs as mates.
Gibbons use calls to tell other gibbons to stay away from their area.

#### Communication with Sight {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbiB3aXRoIFNpZ2h0_3-rkf}

Another way some animals communicate is with sight. By moving in certain
ways or by “making faces,” they show other animals what they mean. Most
primates communicate in this way. For example, a male chimpanzee may
raise his arms and stare at another male chimpanzee. This warns the
other chimpanzee to keep his distance. The chimpanzee pictured below may
look like he is smiling, but he is really showing fear ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yMC1jaGltcC1mZWFyLWdyaW4.) ). He is
communicating to other chimpanzees that he will not challenge them.

**Figure 9.10**

This chimpanzee is communicating with his face. His expression is called
a “fear grin.” It tells other chimpanzees that he is not a threat.

Look at the peacock pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yMS1wZWFjb2NrLWZlYXRoZXJz) ). Why is
he raising his beautiful tail feathers? He is also communicating. He is
showing females of his species that he would be a good mate.

"saying"?

</div>

#### Communication with Scent {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbiB3aXRoIFNjZW50_3-ncm}

Some animals communicate with scent. They release chemicals that other
animals of their species can smell or detect in some other way. Ants
release many different chemicals. Other ants detect the chemicals with
their antennae. This explains how ants are able to work together. The
different chemicals that ants produce have different meanings. Some of
the chemicals signal to all of the ants in a group to come together.
Other chemicals warn of danger. Still other chemicals mark trails to
food sources. When an ant finds food, it marks the trail back to the
nest by leaving behind a chemical on the ground. Other ants follow the
chemical trail to the food.

Many other animals also use chemicals to communicate. You have probably
seen male dogs raise their leg to urinate on a fire hydrant or other
object. Did you know that the dogs were communicating? They mark their
area with a chemical in their urine. Other dogs can smell the chemical.
The scent of the chemical tells other dogs to stay away.

#### Human Communication {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gQ29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbg.._3-2lz}

Like other animals, humans communicate with one another. They mainly use
sound and sight to share information. The most important way in which
humans communicate is with language. **Language** is the use of symbols
to communicate. In human languages, the symbols are words. They stand
for many different things. Words stand for things, people, actions,
feelings, or ideas. Think of several common words. What does each word
stand for? Another important way in which humans communicate is with
facial expressions. Look at the face of the young child pictured below (
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yMi1naXJsLWZhY2lhbC1leHByZXNzaW9u) ).
Can you tell from her face how she is feeling? Humans also use gestures
to communicate. What are people communicating when they shrug their
shoulders? When they shake their head? These are just a few examples of
the ways in which humans share information without using words.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-j6j}

    and scent.

**How are you social?**

When you think about being social, do you think about hanging out and
chatting with friends? Sending a text or posting to Facebook? Humans
socialize in many ways. Social behavior is not limited to humans,
however. Many animals are social.

### Social Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-U29jaWFsIEJlaGF2aW9y_4-5qv}

Why is animal communication important? Without it, animals would not be
able to live together in groups. Animals that live in groups with other
members of their species are called **social animals** . Social animals
include many species of insects, birds, and mammals. Specific examples
of social animals are ants, bees, crows, wolves, lions, and humans. To
live together with one another, these animals must be able to share
information.

#### Highly Social Animals {#9.html#x-ck12-SGlnaGx5IFNvY2lhbCBBbmltYWxz_4-nd9}

Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of
the group depend completely on one another. Different animals within the
group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together
for the good of all. Most species of ants and bees are highly social
animals.

Ants live together in large groups called colonies ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yMy1hbnQtY29sb255) ). A colony may
have millions of ants, making communication among the ants very
important. All of the ants in the colony work together as a single unit.
Each ant has a specific job, and most of the ants are workers. Their job
is to build and repair the colony’s nest. Worker ants also leave the
nest to find food for themselves and other colony members. The workers
care for the young as well. Other ants in the colony are soldiers. They
defend the colony against predators. Each colony also has a queen. Her
only job is to lay eggs. She may lay millions of eggs each month. A few
ants in the colony are called drones. They are the only male ants in the
colony. Their job is to mate with the queen.

Honeybees and bumblebees also live in colonies ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yNC1ob25leWJlZS1jb2xvbnk.) ). Each bee
in the colony has a particular job. Most of the bees are workers. Young
worker bees clean the colony’s hive and feed the young. Older worker
bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest workers
leave the hive to find food. Each colony usually has one queen that lays
eggs. The colony also has a small number of male drones. They mate with
the queen.

### Cooperation {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29vcGVyYXRpb24._4-lrg}

Ants, bees, and other social animals must cooperate. **Cooperation**
means working together with others. Members of the group may cooperate
by sharing food. They may also cooperate by defending each other. Look
at the ants pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yNS1BbnRzLW1vdmluZy1mb29k) ). They
show very clearly why cooperation is important. A single ant would not
be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants.
With cooperation, the job is easy.

**Figure 9.15**

These ants are cooperating. By working together, they are able to move
this much larger insect prey back to their nest. At the nest, they will
share the bee with other ants that do not leave the nest.

</div>

Animals in many other species cooperate. For example, lions live in
groups called prides ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yNi1saW9uLXByaWRl) ). All the lions in
the pride cooperate, though there is still serious competition among the
males. Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride.
Female lions work together to hunt. Then, they share the meat with other
pride members.

Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats. Meerkats are small
mammals that live in Africa. They also live in groups and cooperate with
one another. For example, young female meerkats act as babysitters. They
take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for
food.

**Why do these birds pair up?**

These birds are pairing up so that they can produce offspring. Many
birds are **monogamous** , keeping the same mate for an entire season.
In some species, they even stay paired for their entire life.

### Mating Behavior and Defending Territory {#9.html#x-ck12-TWF0aW5nIEJlaGF2aW9yIGFuZCBEZWZlbmRpbmcgVGVycml0b3J5_5-hjq}

Some of the most important animal behaviors involve mating. **Mating**
is the pairing of an adult male and female to produce young. Adults that
are most successful at attracting a mate are most likely to have
offspring. Traits that help animals attract a mate and have offspring
increase their fitness. As the genes that encode these traits are passed
to the next generation, the traits will become more common in the
population.

#### Courtship Behaviors {#9.html#x-ck12-Q291cnRzaGlwIEJlaGF2aW9ycw.._5-wpr}

In many species, females choose the male they will mate with. For their
part, males try to be chosen as mates. They show females that they would
be a better mate than the other males. To be chosen as a mate, males may
perform **courtship behaviors** . These are special behaviors that help
attract a mate. Male courtship behaviors get the attention of females
and show off a male’s traits. These behaviors are often observed as
direct competition between males.

Different species have different courtship behaviors. One example is a
peacock raising his tail feathers. The colorful peacock is trying to
impress females of his species with his beautiful feathers. Another
example of courtship behavior in birds is the blue-footed booby. He is
doing a dance to attract a female for mating. During the dance, he
spreads out his wings and stamps his feet on the ground. You can watch
the following video of a blue-footed booby doing his courtship dance at:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYmzdvMoUUA](watch?v=oYmzdvMoUUA) .

Courtship behaviors occur in many other species. For example, males in
some species of whales have special mating songs to attract females as
mates. Frogs croak for the same reason. Male deer clash antlers to court
females. Male jumping spiders jump from side to side to attract mates.

Courtship behaviors are one type of display behavior. A **display
behavior** is a fixed set of actions that carries a specific message.
Although many display behaviors are used to attract mates, some display
behaviors have other purposes. For example, display behaviors may be
used to warn other animals to stay away, as you will read below.

#### Caring for the Young {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2FyaW5nIGZvciB0aGUgWW91bmc._5-cvs}

In most species of birds and mammals, one or both parents care for their
offspring. Caring for the young may include making a nest or other
shelter. It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from
predators. Caring for offspring increases their chances of surviving.
Birds called killdeers have an interesting way of protecting their
chicks. When a predator gets too close to her nest, a mother killdeer
pretends to have a broken wing. The mother walks away from the nest
holding her wing as though it were injured ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yOC1raWxsZGVlci1kaXNwbGF5LWJlaGF2aW9y)
). The predator thinks she is injured and will be easy prey. The mother
leads the predator away from the nest and then flies away.

**Figure 9.17**

This mother killdeer is pretending she has a broken wing. She is trying
to attract a predator’s attention in order to protect her chicks. This
behavior puts her at risk of harm. How can it increase her fitness?

</div>

In most species of mammals, parents also teach their offspring important
skills. For example, meerkat parents teach their pups how to eat
scorpions without being stung. A scorpion sting can be deadly, so this
is a very important skill. Teaching the young important skills makes it
more likely that they will survive. Notice that, compared to other types
of animals, birds and mammals have relatively few offspring.

#### Defending Territory {#9.html#x-ck12-RGVmZW5kaW5nIFRlcnJpdG9yeQ.._5-vfg}

Some species of animals are **territorial** . This means that they
defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and
enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely
to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Having a
larger territory could mean more prey or food.

Animals generally do not defend their territory by fighting. Instead,
they are more likely to use display behavior. The behavior tells other
animals to stay away. It gets the message across without the need for
fighting. Display behavior is generally safer and uses less energy than
fighting. Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory.
They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn
other male gorillas to keep away from their area. The robin displays his
red breast to warn other robins to stay away ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yOS1yZWQtcm9iaW4tY2hlc3Q.) ).

</div>

Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory.
This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects. Cats may
also mark their territory by depositing chemicals. They have scent
glands in their face. They deposit chemicals by rubbing their face
against objects.

**What are these butterflies doing?**

Monarch butterflies gather in large groups as they migrate 2,500 miles
south each fall. They return to the north in the spring. This migration
is a cycle that repeats every year.

### Cycles of Behavior {#9.html#x-ck12-Q3ljbGVzIG9mIEJlaGF2aW9y_6-t6o}

Many animal behaviors change in a regular way. They go through cycles.
Some cycles of behavior repeat each year. Other cycles of behavior
repeat every day.

#### Yearly Cycles {#9.html#x-ck12-WWVhcmx5IEN5Y2xlcw.._6-th2}

An example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is **hibernation** .
Hibernation is a state in which an animal’s body processes are slower
than usual, and its body temperature falls. An animal uses less energy
than usual during hibernation. This helps the animal survive during a
time of year when food is scarce. Hibernation may last for weeks or
months. Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and
snakes.

Most people think that bears hibernate. In fact, bears do not go into
true hibernation. In the winter, they go into a deep sleep. However,
their body processes do not slow down very much. Their body temperature
also remains about the same as usual. Bears can be awakened easily from
their winter sleep.

Another example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is **migration** .
Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another.
Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the
environment. For example, animals may migrate when the days get shorter
in the fall. Migration is most common in birds, fish, and insects. In
the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, including robins and
geese, travel south for the winter. They migrate to areas where it is
warmer and where there is more food. They return north in the spring. A
flock of migrating geese is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0zMC1HZWVzZS1mbHlpbmc.) ).

**Figure 9.19**

These geese are flying south for the winter. Flocks of geese migrate in

Some animals migrate very long distances. The map shown below shows the
migration route of a species of hawk called Swainson’s hawk ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0zMS1zd2FpbnNvbi1oYXdrLW1pZ3JhdGlvbg..)
). About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to finish? Are
you surprised that birds migrate that far? Some species of birds migrate
even farther. Whales also are known to migrate thousands of miles each
year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months. The great
migration of millions of zebra, wildebeest and other antelope in East
Africa also occurs yearly. Each year around 1.5 million wildebeest and
300,000 zebra (along with other antelope) go in search of food and
water, traveling a distance of around 1800 miles.

hawk](ck12_9_files/20150911113333855431.jpeg "The route of migration for Swainson's hawk")

**Figure 9.20**

The migration route of Swainson’s hawk starts in North America and ends
in South America. Scientists learned their migration route by attaching
tiny tracking devices to the birds. The birds were then tracked by
satellite. On the migration south, the hawks travel almost 5,000 miles
from start to finish.

</div>

Birds and other migrating animals follow the same routes each year. How
do they know where to go? It depends on the species. Some animals follow
landmarks, such as rivers or coastlines. Other animals are guided by the
position of the sun, the usual direction of the wind, or other clues in
the environment.

#### Daily Cycles {#9.html#x-ck12-RGFpbHkgQ3ljbGVz_6-ja5}

Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day, day after day. For
example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets and wake up when the
sun rises. Animals that are active during the daytime are called
**diurnal** . Some animals do the opposite. They sleep all day and are
active during the night. These animals are called **nocturnal** .
Examples of nocturnal animals include bats, foxes, possums, skunks and
coyotes. Many mammals (including humans), insects, reptiles and birds
are diurnal.

Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have
daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after
dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. Daily
cycles of behavior are called **circadian rhythms** .

In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a
tiny structure called the **biological clock** . This structure is
located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends
signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and
body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the
biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-ie9}

-   Yearly cycles of behavior include hibernation and migration.
-   Daily cycles of behavior, including sleeping a waking, are called
    circadian rhythms.

**How are these jellyfish like an insect?**

Jellyfish and insects don't seem to have much in common. They look much
different. They live in very different environments. But both of these
animals are classified as invertebrates.

### What Are Invertebrates? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgSW52ZXJ0ZWJyYXRlcz8.-1n6}

Animals are often identified as being either invertebrates or
vertebrates. These are terms based on the skeletons of the animals.
**Vertebrates** have a backbone made of bone or cartilage (
**cartilage** is a flexible supportive tissue. You have cartilage in
your ear lobes.). **Invertebrates** , on the other hand, have no
backbone ( **Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0wNC1zbmFpbHM.)
). Invertebrates live just about anywhere. There are so many
invertebrates on this planet that it is impossible to count them all.
There are probably billions of billions of invertebrates. They come in
many shapes and sizes, live practically anywhere and provide many
services that are vital for the survival of other organisms, including
us. They have been observed in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, in
the driest of the deserts and in the canopies of the wettest
rainforests. They can even be found in the frozen Antarctic or on the
deepest parts of the ocean floor.

</div>

All vertebrate organisms are in the phylum Chordata. Invertebrates,
which make up about 95% (or more) of the animal kingdom, are divided
into over 30 different phyla, some of which are listed below ( **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6UGh5bHVtX0V4YW1wbGVz) ). Numerous
invertebrate phyla have just a few species; some have only one described
species, yet these are classified into separate phyla because of their
unique characteristics. For example, sponges, with pores throughout
their body, are from the phylum  Porifera. Crabs and lobsters, with
jointed appendages, are from the phylum Arthropoda.

  **Phylum**        **Meaning**       **Examples**
  ----------------- ----------------- ------------------------
  Porifera          Pore bearer       Sponges
  Cnidaria          Stinging nettle   Jellyfish, corals
  Platyhelminthes   Flat worms        Flatworms, tapeworms
  Nematoda          Thread like       Nematodes, heartworm

**Do animals wash your dishes?**

Natural sponges, like the one in the picture above, are actually animals
taken from the sea! The sponges in your home, however, were most likely
never living things. Most sponges used in kitchens today are made from
unnatural materials.

### Sponges {#10.html#x-ck12-U3Bvbmdlcw.._1-wjt}

**Sponges** ( **Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfc3BvbmdlMg..) )
are classified in the phylum Porifera, from the Latin words meaning
"having pores." These pores allow the movement of water into the
sponges’ sac-like bodies. Sponges must pump water through their bodies
in order to eat. Because sponges are **sessile** , meaning they cannot
move, they filter water to obtain their food. They are, therefore, known
as **filter feeders.** Filter feeders must filter the water to separate
out the organisms and nutrients they want to eat from those they do not.

**Figure 10.2**

The sponges often have tube-like bodies with many tiny pores. There are
roughly 5,000 sponge species.

You might think that sponges don't look like animals at all. They don't
have a head or legs. Internally, they do not have brains, stomachs, or
other organs. This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other
animals. In fact, sponges do not even have true tissues. Instead, their
bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization) that
do specific jobs. Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level
organization because they have tissues with specific functions. 

Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more
independent of each other than are the cells of other animals. For
example, some cells control the flow of water, in and out of the sponge,
by increasing or decreasing the size of the pores.

Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As
sponges don't have mouths, they must feed by some other method. Sponges
have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells
in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped
through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water
through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella,
which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals.

Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means. Sponges that
reproduce asexually produce buds or, more often, structures called
**gemmules** , which are packets of several cells of various types
inside a protective covering. Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules
prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the
following spring. Most sponges that reproduce sexually are
hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different times. Sperm are
frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges
of the same species. The sperm are then transported to eggs,
fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae. Some sponges
release their larvae, where others retain them for some time. Once the
larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into juvenile sponges.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-wul}

**Are corals animal, plant, or mineral?**

Some corals may look like rocks. But they are alive! And some corals may
look like plants, but they are actually animals. Just like all other
animals, they eat food to get energy.

### Cnidarians {#10.html#x-ck12-Q25pZGFyaWFucw.._2-1fd}

**Cnidarians** , in the phylum *Cnidaria* , include organisms such as
the jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. These animals are found in
shallow ocean water. You might know that these animals can give you a
painful sting if you step on them. That’s because cnidarians have
stinging cells known as **nematocysts** . Cnidarians use nematocysts to
catch their food. When touched, the nematocysts release a thread of
poison that can be used to paralyze prey. Cnidarians are among the
simplest of the so-called "higher" organisms, but are also among the
most beautiful.

#### Body plan {#10.html#x-ck12-Qm9keSBwbGFu_2-cgt}

The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show
radial symmetry, making these animals very different from those that
evolved before them. Radial symmetry means that they have a circular
body plan, and any cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal
halves.

The cnidarians have two basic body forms:

1.  **Polyp** : The polyp is a cup-shaped body with the mouth facing
    upward, such as a sea anemone and coral.
2.  **Medusa** : The medusa is a bell-shaped body with the mouth and
    tentacles facing downward, such as a jellyfish.

Unlike the sponges which evolved prior to cnidarians, the cnidarians are
made up of true tissues. The inside of a cnidarian is called the
**gastrovascular cavity** , a large space that helps the organism digest
and move nutrients around the body. The cnidarians also have nerve
tissue organized into a net-like structure, known as a nerve-net, with
connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body. Cnidarians do not
have true organs, however.

Reproduction is by asexual budding (polyps) or sexual formation of
gametes (medusae, some polyps). The result of sexual reproduction is a
larva, which can swim on its own.

#### Cnidarian Colonies {#10.html#x-ck12-Q25pZGFyaWFuIENvbG9uaWVz_2-mfr}

Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies. Two examples
are described below.

1.  The Portuguese Man o' War ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0wOS1NYW4tby13YXI.) ) looks like a
    single organism but is actually a colony of polyps. One polyp is
    filled with air to help the colony float, while several feeding
    polyps hang below with tentacles. The tentacles are full
    of nematocysts. The Portuguese Man o' War is known to cause
    extremely painful stings to swimmers and surfers who accidentally
    brush up against it in the water.

2.  Coral reefs ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0xMC1Db3JhbC1SZWVm) ) look like
    big rocks, but they are actually alive. They are built from
    cnidarians called corals. The corals are sessile (non-moving) polyps
    that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that
    pass by. Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate, which is
    also known as limestone. Over long periods of time, their skeletons
    build on each other to produce large structures known as
    coral reefs. Coral reefs are important habitats for many different
    types of ocean life.

**Do worms have eyes?**

You might think that worms can't see. But some worms, such as the above
*Dugesia* flatworm, do have eyespots. These are not exactly like your
eyes, however. Eyespots can only detect light in their environment.

### Flatworms {#10.html#x-ck12-RmxhdHdvcm1z_3-cy9}

The word "worm" is not very scientific. But it is a word that informally
describes animals (usually invertebrates) that have long bodies with no
arms or legs. (Snakes are vertebrates, so they are not usually described
as worms.) Worms are the first significant group of animals with
bilateral symmetry, meaning that the right side of their bodies is a
mirror of the left. 

One type of worm is the **flatworm** . Worms in the phylum
*Platyhelminthes* are called flatworms because they have flattened
bodies. There are more than 18,500 known species of flatworms.

#### Features of Flatworms {#10.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgRmxhdHdvcm1z_3-uac}

The main characteristics of flatworms ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0xMi1GbGF0d29ybQ..) ) include:

1.  Flatworms have no true body cavity, but they do have
    bilateral symmetry. Due to the lack of a body cavity,flatworms are
    known as acoelomates.
2.  Flatworms have an incomplete digestive system. This means that the
    digestive tract has only one opening. Digestion takes place in the
    gastrovascular cavity.
3.  Flatworms do not have a respiratory system. Instead, they have pores
    that allow oxygen to enter through their body. Oxygen enters the
    pores by diffusion.
4.  There are no blood vessels in the flatworms. Their **gastrovascular
    cavity** helps distribute nutrients throughout the body.
5.  Flatworms have a ladder-like nervous system; two interconnected
    parallel nerve cords run the length of the body.
6.  Most flatworms have a distinct head region that includes nerve cells
    and sensory organs, such as eyespots. The development of a head
    region, called **cephalization** , evolved at the same time as
    bilateral symmetry in animals.  This process does not occur in
    cnidarians, which evolved prior to flatworms and have
    radial symmetry.

**Figure 10.5**

Marine flatworms can be brightly colored, such as this one from the
class Turbellaria. These worms are mostly carnivores or scavengers.

</div>

#### Flatworms in the Environment {#10.html#x-ck12-RmxhdHdvcm1z_3IGluIHRoZSBFbnZpcm9ubWVudA..-j7b}

Flatworms live in a variety of environments. Some species of flatworms
are free-living organisms that feed on small organisms and rotting
matter. These types of flatworms include marine flatworms and freshwater
flatworms, such as *Dugesia* .

Other types of flatworms are parasitic. That means they live inside
another organism, called a host, in order to get the food and energy
they need. For example, **tapeworms** have a head-like area with tiny
hooks and suckers (known as the **scolex** ) that help the worm attach
to the intestines of an animal host ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0xMy10YXBld29ybQ..) ). There are over
11,000 species of parasitic flatworms.

**What is heartworm?**

You may have heard that you need to protect your pets from heartworm.
Heartworms are a type of roundworm. They can be parasites in cats and
dogs. That means, once they infect your pet, they can cause harm.
However, there are preventative treatments available.

### Roundworms {#10.html#x-ck12-Um91bmR3b3Jtcw.._4-vnq}

The word "worm" is not very scientific. This informal term describes
animals (usually invertebrates) that have long bodies with no arms or
legs. Worms with round, non-segmented bodies are known as nematodes or
**roundworms** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0xNS1uZW1hdG9kZS1wYXJhc2l0ZXM.) ).
They are classified in the phylum *Nematoda* , which has over 28,000
known species. Some scientists believe there could be over a million
species of Nematodes.

Nematodes are slender bilaterally symmetrical worms, typically less than
2.5 mm long. The smallest nematodes are microscopic, while free-living
species can reach as much as 5 cm, and some parasitic species are larger
still, reaching over a meter in length. The worm body is often covered
with ridges, rings, bristles, or other distinctive structures. The
radially symmetrical head of a nematode also has distinct features. The
head is covered with sensory bristles and, in many cases, solid
"head-shields" around the mouth region. The mouth has either three or
six lips arranged around the mouth opening, which often have a series of
teeth on their inner edges.

#### Features of Roundworms {#10.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgUm91bmR3b3Jtcw.._4-nqh}

1.  Unlike the flatworms, the roundworms have a body cavity with
    internal organs.
2.  A roundworm has a complete digestive system, which includes both a
    mouth and an anus. This is a significant difference from the
    incomplete digestive system of flatworms. The roundworm digestive
    system also include a large digestive organ known as the gut.
    Digestive enzymes that start to break down food are produced here.
    There is no stomach, but there is an intestine which produces
    enzymes that help absorb nutrients. The last portion of the
    intestine forms a rectum, which expels waste through the anus.
3.  Roundworms also have a simple nervous system with a primitive brain.
    There are four nerves that run the length of the body and are
    connected from the top to the bottom of the body. At the anterior
    end of the animal (the head region), the nerves branch from a
    circular ring which serves as the brain. The head of a nematode has
    a few tiny sense organs, including chemoreceptors, which
    sense chemicals. Though still a relatively simple structure, the
    nervous system of roundworms is very different from that of the
    cnidarian nerve net.

#### Roundworms in the Environment {#10.html#x-ck12-Um91bmR3b3JtcyBpbiB0aGUgRW52aXJvbm1lbnQ._4-eyb}

Roundworms can be free-living organisms, but they are probably best
known for their role as significant plant and animal parasites. Most
Nematodes are parasitic, with over 16,000 parasitic species described.
Heartworms, which cause serious disease in dogs while living in the
heart and blood vessels, are a type of roundworm. Roundworms can also
cause disease in humans. Elephantiasis, a disease characterized by the
extreme swelling of the limbs ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0xNi1lbGVwaGFudGlhc2lz) ), is caused
by infection with a type of roundworm.

Most parasitic roundworm eggs or larvae are found in the soil and enter
the human body when a person picks them up on the hands and then
transfers them to the mouth. The eggs or larvae also can enter the human
body directly through the skin. The best solution to these diseases is
to try to prevent these diseases rather than treat or cure them.

Diseases caused by roundworms are more common in developing countries.
Many parasitic diseases caused by roundworms result from poor personal
hygiene. Contributing factors may include

-   lack of a clean water supply,
-   inadequate sanitation measures,
-   crowded living conditions, combined with a lack of access to health
    care and low levels of education.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-hml}

-   Roundworms have a body cavity with internal organs and a simple
    nervous system.
-   Roundworms can be free-living or parasitic.

**Does an earthworm have a brain?**

Just like you, earthworms do have a brain. Their brains are much simpler
than yours, however. Earthworms’ brains allow them to sense and respond
to light and touch.

### Segmented Worms {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VnbWVudGVkIFdvcm1z_5-kic}

When you think of worms, you probably picture earthworms. There are
actually many types of worms, including flatworms, roundworms, and
segmented worms. Earthworms are segmented worms.

Segmented worms are in the phylum *Annelida* , which has over 22,000
known species. These worms are known as the **segmented worms** because
their bodies are segmented, or separated into repeating units. Besides
the earthworm, the segmented worms also include leeches and some marine
worms. Most segmented worms like the earthworm, feed on dead organic
matter. **Leeches** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMS0xOC1MZWVjaA..) ), however, can live
in fresh water and suck blood from their animal host. You may have
noticed many earthworms in soil. Earthworms support terrestrial
ecosystems both as prey and by aerating and enriching soil.

**Figure 10.9**

Leeches are parasitic worms. Notice the presence of segments.

</div>

#### Features of Segmented Worms {#10.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgU2VnbWVudGVkIFdvcm1z_5-vjs}

Segmented worms have a number of characteristic features.

1.  The basic form consists of multiple segments, each of which has the
    same sets of organs and, in most, a pair of **parapodia** that many
    species use for locomotion.
2.  Segmented worms have a well-developed body cavity filled with fluid.
    This fluid-filled cavity serves as a **hydroskeleton** , a
    supportive structure that helps move the worm's muscles. Only the
    most primitive worms (the flatworms) lack a body cavity.
3.  Segmented worms also tend to have organ systems that are more
    developed than the roundworms' or flatworms'. Earthworms, for
    example, have a complete digestive tract with two openings, as well
    as an esophagus and intestines. The circulatory system consists of
    paired hearts and blood vessels. Actually there are five pairs of
    hearts that pump blood along the two main vessels. And the nervous
    system consists of the brain and a ventral nerve cord.

#### Comparison of Worms {#10.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFyaXNvbiBvZiBXb3Jtcw.._5-pmx}

The following table compares the three worm phyla ( **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q29tcGFyaXNvbi1vZi10aHJlZS13b3JtLXBoeWxh)
).

  **Phylum**        **Common Name**   **Body Cavity**   **Segmented**   **Digestive System**   **Example**
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- --------------- ---------------------- -------------
  Platyhelminthes   Flatworm          No                No              Incomplete             Tapeworm
  Nematoda          Roundworm         Yes               No              Complete               Heartworm
  Annelida          Segmented worm    Yes               Yes             Complete               Earthworm

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-sae}

-   Segmented worms include the common earthworm and leeches.
-   Segmented worms have a digestive system, nervous system, and
    circulatory system.

**What does this snail have in common with a clam?**

You might notice that both have a shell. That is one feature of the
group they both belong to, the mollusks. Mollusks are a very diverse
group. They include animals that live on land and in the ocean. With
well over 100,000 species, there can be a lot of shells.

### What are Mollusks? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgTW9sbHVza3M__6-t1o}

When you take a walk along a beach, what do you find there? Sand, the
ocean, lots of sunlight. You may also find shells. The shells you find
are most likely left by organisms in the phylum *Mollusca* . On the
beach, you can find the shells of many different mollusks ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0wMS1iZWFjaC1tb2xsdXNrcw..) ),
including clams, mussels, scallops, oysters, and snails. **Mollusks**
are invertebrates that usually have a hard shell, a mantle, and a
radula. Their glossy pearls, mother of pearl, and abalone shells are
like pieces of jewelry. Some mollusks, such as squid and octopus, do not
have shells.

**Figure 10.10**

On the beach, you can find a wide variety of mollusk shells.

</div>

#### Features of the Mollusk {#10.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgdGhlIE1vbGx1c2s._6-ums}

The Mollusk's body is often divided into different parts ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE1LW1vbGx1c2stYm9keS1wbGFu) ):

1.  A head with eyes or tentacles.
2.  In most species, a muscular foot, which helps the mollusk move. Some
    mollusks use the foot for burrowing into the sand, and others use it
    for jet-propulsion.
3.  A **mantle** , or fold of the outer skin lining the shell. The
    mantle often releases calcium carbonate, which creates an external
    shell, just like the ones you find on the beach. The shell is made
    of **chitin** , a tough, semitransparent substance.
4.  A mass housing the organs.
5.  A complete digestive tract that begins at the mouth and runs to
    the anus.
6.  Most ocean mollusks have a gill or gills to absorb oxygen from
    the water.
7.  Many species have a feeding structure, the **radula** , found only
    in mollusks. The radula can be thought of as a
    "tongue-like" structure. The radula is made mostly of chitin. Types
    of radulae range from structures used to scrape algae off of rocks
    to the beaks of squid and octopuses.

This is the basic body plan of a mollusk. Note the mantle, gills, and

</div>

#### Evolution of Mollusks {#10.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE1vbGx1c2tz_6-hju}

Mollusks are probably most closely related to organisms in the phylum
*Annelida* , also known as segmented worms. This phylum includes the
earthworm and leech. Scientists believe these two groups are related
because, when they are in the early stage of development, they look very
similar. Mollusks also share features of their organ systems with
segmented worms. Unlike segmented worms, however, mollusks do not have
body segmentation. The basic mollusk body shape is usually quite
different as well.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-9bo}

-   The mollusk body often has a head with tentacles, a muscular foot, a
    feeding organ called the radula, and a complete digestive tract.
-   Mollusks have a mantle, which often secretes an external shell.
-   Mollusks are most closely related to segmented worms.

**What's the world's largest mollusk?**

The colossal squid, one of the largest invertebrates, measures 14 feet
in length here. Some of these squids are even larger and can grow up to
almost 50 feet long! The smallest mollusks are snails that are
microscopic in size.

### Types of Mollusks {#10.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTW9sbHVza3M._7-tro}

There are approximately 160,000 living species and probably 70,000
extinct species of mollusks. They are typically divided into ten
classes, of which two are extinct. The major classes of living mollusks
include gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0wNy1vc3RyaWNoLWZvb3Q.) ).

#### Gastropods {#10.html#x-ck12-R2FzdHJvcG9kcw.._7-t2a}

**Gastropods** include snails and slugs. They use their foot to crawl.
They have a well-developed head. There are many thousands of species of
sea snails and sea slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater
limpets, land snails and land slugs. Gastropods live in many diverse
habitats, from gardens to deserts and mountains. They also live in
rivers, lakes and the ocean. Most shelled gastropods have a one-piece
shell that is typically coiled or spiraled, but not all gastropods have
shells. Gastropods have no sense of hearing, but they can see and have a
keen sense of smell. In land-based gastropods, the olfactory organs (for
smell) are the most important. These are located on the tentacles.

#### Bivalves {#10.html#x-ck12-Qml2YWx2ZXM._7-zos}

**Bivalves** include clams, scallops, oysters, and mussels. As their
name implies, they have two parts of their shell, which can open and
close. Bivalves live in both marine and freshwater habitats. Most
bivalves have a pair of large gills that enable them to extract oxygen
from the water (to breathe) and to capture food. Water is drawn into the
bivalve and washes over the gills. Mucus on the gills helps capture food
and cilia transfer the food particles to the mouth. Once in the mouth,
food passes into the stomach to be digested. Bivalves have a mouth,
heart, intestine, gills, and stomach, but no head. Bivalves have a
muscular foot, which in many species such as clams, is used to anchor
their body to a surface or dig down into the sand.

#### Cephalopods {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2VwaGFsb3BvZHM._7-o1t}

**Cephalopods** include the octopus and squid. They have a prominent
head and a well-developed brain. Typically the foot has been modified
into a set of arms or tentacles. Members of this class can change color.
They can also change texture and body shape, and, and if those
camouflage techniques don't work, they can still "disappear" in a cloud
of ink. Cephalopods have three hearts that pump blue blood, they're jet
powered by their muscular foot, and they're found in all oceans of the
world. Cephalopods are thought to be the most intelligent of
invertebrates. They have eyes and other senses that rival those of
humans. Many cephalopods are active and efficient predators. What
features do you think allows for this?

**Where do pearls come from?**

Pearls are highly valued as gemstones. Most gemstones come from the
Earth, but pearls come from living things. They are created by mollusks,
such as oysters.

### Importance of Mollusks {#10.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBNb2xsdXNrcw.._8-nsd}

Mollusks are important in a variety of ways; they are used as food, for
decoration, in jewelry, and in scientific studies. They are even used as
roadbed material and in vitamin supplements.

#### Mollusks as Food {#10.html#x-ck12-TW9sbHVza3MgYXMgRm9vZA.._8-5u0}

Edible species of mollusks include numerous species of clams, mussels,
oysters, scallops, marine and land snails, squid, and octopuses. Many
species of mollusks, such as **oysters** , are farmed in order to
produce more than could be found in the wild ( **Figure**

</div>

Today, fisheries in Europe, Japan, and the US alone produce over 1
billion pounds of oyster meat each year. Abalone (a marine gastropod
mollusk), a great delicacy, can fetch up to three hundred dollars per
pound. Eating mollusks is associated with a risk of food poisoning from
toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many
countries have regulations to reduce this risk. At certain times of the
year, (usually the warmer months) many species of saltwater mollusks
become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as "red tide." The
mollusks filter feed on the tiny creatures (called dinoflagellates in
the bloom) that produce the toxins. Eating shellfish during a red tide
can cause serious illness and even death to humans.

Tastes in molluscan food vary tremendously from one person to the next
and from culture to culture; however, when it comes to a question of
survival, most mollusks are edible. Some are considered delicacies such
as oysters and escargot <span class="c1"> (a snail that lives in
trees),  </span> while others such as the clams and mussels of
freshwater ponds and streams are less likely to be consumed due to
taste, but none-the-less are very edible. Land-based mollusks are also
eaten. France alone consumes 5 million pounds of escargot every year. Of
course, some people are allergic to mollusks and need to be careful
about consuming any kind of shelled animals.

#### Mollusks in Decoration and Jewelry {#10.html#x-ck12-TW9sbHVza3MgaW4gRGVjb3JhdGlvbiBhbmQgSmV3ZWxyeQ.._8-anr}

Two natural products of mollusks used for decorations and jewelry are
pearls and nacre. A **pearl** is the hard, round object produced within
the mantle of a living shelled mollusk. Pearls are produced by many
bivalves when a tiny particle of sand or grit is trapped between the
mantle and the shell. It's as if the mollusk has a splinter. The mollusk
forms a protective covering around the irritant. Most pearls used as
jewelry are made by pearl oysters and freshwater mussels; most of the
ones sold are cultured and not wild. Natural pearls have been highly
valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries.

The most desirable pearls are produced by oysters and river mussels. The
substance used to form the pearl covering is made from the mother of
pearl material that lines the interior of the shell.

Mother of pearl is also known as nacre. **Nacre** is the iridescent
inner shell layer. It can be found in buttons, watch faces, knives,
guns, and jewelry. It is also used to decorate various musical
instruments.

#### Mollusks in Scientific Studies {#10.html#x-ck12-TW9sbHVza3MgaW4gU2NpZW50aWZpYyBTdHVkaWVz_8-waq}

Several mollusks are ideal subjects for scientific investigation of the
nervous system. The giant squid has a sophisticated nervous system and a
complex brain for study. The California sea slug, also called the
California sea hare, is used in studies of learning and memory because
it has a simple nervous system, consisting of just a few thousand large,
easily identified neurons. These **neurons** are responsible for a
variety of learning tasks. Some slug brain studies have even allowed
scientists to better understand human brains. Some octopuses and squid
are incredibly smart. They are capable of learning to solve problems and
do mazes.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-jtf}

-   Some mollusks, such as oysters and scallops, are important
    food sources.
-   Mollusks are used for decoration and are important in
    scientific studies.

**What is a sea cucumber?**

A sea cucumber is not a vegetable! It is an invertebrate animal found in
the ocean. Note the spines on this sea cucumber. The spines are a key
feature of echinoderms.

### What are Echinoderms? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgRWNoaW5vZGVybXM__9-ugz}

You're probably familiar with starfish and sand dollars ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0xMi1lY2hpbm9kZXJtcw..) ). They are
both **echinoderms** . **Sea urchins** and sea cucumbers are also
echinoderms. What's similar between these three organisms? They all have
**radial symmetry** . This means that the body is arranged around a
central point.

Echinoderms belong to the phylum *Echinodermata* . This phylum includes
7,000 living species. It is the largest animal phylum without freshwater
or land-living members.

#### Characteristics of Echinoderms {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEVjaGlub2Rlcm1z_9-hge}

As mentioned earlier, echinoderms show radial symmetry. Other key
echinoderm features include an internal skeleton and spines, as well as
a few organs and organ systems. Although echinoderms look like they have
a hard exterior, they do not have an external skeleton. Instead, a thin
outer skin covers an internal skeleton made of tiny plates and spines.
This provides rigid support. Some groups of echinoderms, such as sea
urchins ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0xMy1zZWEtdXJjaGlu) ), have spines
that protect the organism. Sea cucumbers use these spines to help them
move.

</div>

Echinoderms have a unique **water vascular system** . This network of
fluid-filled tubes helps them to breathe, eat, and move. Therefore, they
can function without gill slits. Echinoderms also have a very simple
digestive system, circulatory system, and nervous system. The digestive
system often leads directly from the mouth to the anus. The echinoderms
have an open circulatory system, meaning that fluid moves freely in the
body cavity. But echinoderms have no heart. This may be due to their
simple radial symmetry - a heart is not needed to pump the freely moving
fluid. The echinoderm nervous system is a **nerve net** , or
interconnected neurons with no central brain.

Many echinoderms have amazing powers of regeneration. For example, some
sea stars (starfish) are capable of regenerating lost arms. In some
cases, lost arms have been observed to regenerate a second complete sea
star! Sea cucumbers often release parts of their internal organs if they
perceive danger. The released organs and tissues are then quickly
regenerated.

#### How do Echinoderms Eat? {#10.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIEVjaGlub2Rlcm1zIEVhdD8._9-nuy}

Feeding strategies vary greatly among the different groups of
echinoderms. There's no one food or technique that's shared by all
echinoderms. Different eating-methods include:

1.  Passive filter-feeders, which are organisms that absorb suspended
    nutrients from passing water. Some echinoderms use their long arms
    to capture food particles floating past in the currents.
2.  Grazers, such as sea urchins, are organisms that feed on
    available plants. Sea urchins are omnivorous, eating both plant
    and animals. The sea urchin mainly feeds on algae on the coral and
    rocks, along with decomposing matter such as dead fish, mussels,
    sponges, and barnacles.
3.  Deposit feeders, which are organisms that feed on small pieces of
    organic matter, usually in the top layer of soil. Sea cucumbers are
    deposit feeders, living on the ocean floor. They eat the tiny scrap
    particles that are usually abundant in the environments that
    they inhabit.
4.  Active hunters, which are organisms that actively hunt their prey.
    Many sea stars are predators, feeding on mollusks like clams by
    prying apart their shells and actually placing their stomach inside
    the mollusk shell to digest the meat.

#### How do Echinoderms Reproduce? {#10.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIEVjaGlub2Rlcm1zIFJlcHJvZHVjZT8._9-ezy}

Echinoderms reproduce sexually. In most echinoderms, eggs and sperm
cells are released into open water, and fertilization takes place when
the eggs and sperm meet. This is called external fertilization, and is
typical of many marine animals. The release of sperm and eggs often
occurs when organisms are in the same place at the same time. Internal
fertilization takes place in only a few species. Some species even take
care of their offspring, like parents!

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-p86}

-   Echinoderms show radial symmetry and have an endoskeleton and a
    unique water vascular system. Some have spines.
-   Echinoderms generally reproduce by external fertilization;
    regeneration is fairly common among echinoderms.

**How can you find feathers in the ocean?**

Birds aren't the only creatures that have feathers. One type of
echinoderm, the feather star, has feathery arms. These animals don't fly
or even move much at all. They usually cling to rocks, using a root-like
structure.

### Types of Echinoderms {#10.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgRWNoaW5vZGVybXM._10-9zo}

The echinoderms can be divided into two major groups:

1.  Eleutherozoa are the echinoderms that can move. This group includes
    the starfish and most other echinoderms.
2.  Pelmatozoa are the immobile echinoderms. This group includes
    **crinoids** , such as the **feather stars** .

Listed below are the four main classes of echinoderms present in the
Eleutherozoa Group ( **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZWxldXRoZXJvem9hLWVjaGlub2Rlcm1z) ).

  **Class**       **Representative Organisms**                                                             **Characteristics**

  Ophiuroidea     Brittle stars ( **Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0xNy1icml0dGxlLXN0YXI.) )   Bottom feeders with long, narrow, flexible arms that allow relatively fast movement.

#### Habitat {#10.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdA.._10-nho}

Echinoderms are spread all over the world at almost all depths,
latitudes, and environments in the ocean. Most feather stars (crinoids)
live in shallow water. In the deep ocean, sea cucumbers are common,
sometimes making up 90% of the organisms. Most echinoderms, however, are
found in reefs just lying beneath the surface of the water. No
echinoderms are found in freshwater habitats or on land. This makes
*Echinodermata* the largest animal phylum to only have ocean-based
species.

#### Do Echinoderms Move? {#10.html#x-ck12-RG8gRWNoaW5vZGVybXMgTW92ZT8._10-z2m}

While almost all echinoderms live on the sea floor, some sea-lilies can
swim at great speeds for brief periods of time, and a few sea cucumbers
are fully floating. Some echinoderms find other ways of moving. For
example, crinoids attach themselves to floating logs, and some sea
cucumbers move by attaching to the sides of fish.

On the underside side of a sea star, there are hundreds of tiny feet
usually arranged into several rows on each ray of the star. These are
called tube feet, or podia, and are filled with seawater in most
echinoderms. The water vascular system within the body of the animal is
also filled with seawater. By expanding and contracting chambers within
the water vascular system, the echinoderm can force water into certain
tube feet to extend them. The animal has muscles in the tube feet, which
are used to retract them. By expanding and retracting the right tube
feet in the proper order, the animal can walk.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-pie}

-   Echinoderms include the star fish, sea urchins, sand dollars, and
    feather stars.
-   Echinoderms are found in many different ocean environments, but most
    are found in reefs.

**What do sea otters eat?**

Sea otters are known for being playful and frisky. They are serious
eaters, however! A major part of a sea otter's diet are echinoderms,
such as sea urchins. They manage to eat the soft part of the sea urchins
while avoiding the huge sea urchin spines.

### Importance of Echinoderms {#10.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBFY2hpbm9kZXJtcw.._11-e3g}

Echinoderms are important for the ecosystem. They are also a source of
food and medicine for humans.

#### Ecological Role {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9naWNhbCBSb2xl_11-26z}

Echinoderms play numerous ecological roles. Sand dollars and sea
cucumbers burrow into the sand, providing more oxygen at greater depths
of the sea floor. This allows more organisms to live there. In addition,
starfish prevent the growth of algae on coral reefs. This allows the
coral to filter-feed more easily. And many sea cucumbers provide a
habitat for parasites such as crabs, worms, and snails.

Echinoderms are also an important step in the ocean food chain.
Echinoderms are the staple diet of many animals, including the sea
otter. On the other hand, echinoderms eat seaweed and keep its growth in
check. Recall that the sea urchin is a grazer, mainly feeding on algae
on the coral and rocks. Recently, some marine ecosystems have been
overrun by seaweed. Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs. Scientists
believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has
caused this destruction ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfc2Vhd2VlZA..) ).

#### Echinoderms as Food {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNoaW5vZGVybXMgYXMgRm9vZA.._11-mxw}

In some countries, echinoderms are considered delicacies. Around 50,000
tons of sea urchins are captured each year for food. They are consumed
mostly in Japan, Peru, Spain and France. Both male and female gonads of
sea urchins are also consumed. The taste is described as soft and
melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit. Sea cucumbers are
considered a delicacy in some southeastern Asian countries. In China
they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups and stews.

#### Echinoderms as Medicine {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNoaW5vZGVybXMgYXMgTWVkaWNpbmU._11-hmy}

Echinoderms are also used as medicine and in scientific research. For
example, some sea cucumber toxins slow down the growth rate of tumor
cells, so there is an interest in using these in cancer research.

Sea urchins are also model organisms used in developmental biology
research. Sea urchins have been used to study the mechanisms of
fertilization and egg activation, physiological processes that occur
during early development, and the regulation of differentiation in the
early embryo. In addition, the molecular basis of early development was
studied in sea urchins. Gametes can be obtained easily, sterility is not
required, and the eggs and early embryos of many commonly used species
are beautifully transparent. In addition, the early development of sea
urchin embryos is a highly conserved process. When a batch of eggs is
fertilized, all of the resulting embryos typically develop at the same
time. This makes biochemical and molecular studies of early embryos
possible in the sea urchin, and has led to a number of major
discoveries.

#### Echinoderms in Farming {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNoaW5vZGVybXMgaW4gRmFybWluZw.._11-efo}

The hard skeleton of echinoderms is used as a source of lime by farmers
in some areas where limestone is unavailable. **Lime** is added to the
soil to allow plants to take up more nutrients. About 4,000 tons of the
animals are used each year for this purpose.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-dnl}

-   Echinoderms are an important part of the ocean food chain, keeping

**What does this lobster have in common with a wasp?**

You might notice that their bodies have segments. And they both have a
hard outer layer. Because they share these and other features, they are
both classified as arthropods.

### What are Arthropods? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgQXJ0aHJvcG9kcz8._12-di8}

How often do you think you see an arthropod? Well, have you ever looked
up close at an ant? A spider? A fly? A moth? With over a million
described species (and many more yet to be described) in the phylum
containing arthropods, chances are, you encounter one of these organisms
every day, without even leaving your house. Arthropods are a very
diverse group of animals. In fact, they are the biggest group of animals
on the planet, with upwards of 5 million distinct species.

#### Types of Arthropods {#10.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQXJ0aHJvcG9kcw.._12-poc}

**Arthropods** belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which means “jointed
feet,” and includes four living subphyla.

-   Chelicerata, which includes spiders ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0xOC1zcGlkZXI.) ), mites,
    and scorpions. In these animals, the first pair of appendages are
    often modified as fangs or pincers, and are used to manipulate food.
    Spiders have eight legs.
-   Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes. All of these
    animals live on land, and can have anywhere from ten to nearly 200
    pairs of appendages.
-   Hexapoda, which includes the insects. These animals dominate
    the land. All hexapods have three pairs (six appendages) of
    walking appendages.
-   Crustacea, which includes lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayfish,
    and shrimp. These animals dominate the ocean, and usually have a set
    of anterior appendages that are modified as mandibles, which
    function in grasping, biting, and chewing food.

#### Characteristics of Arthropods {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEFydGhyb3BvZHM._12-wbq}

Characteristics of arthropods include:

1.  A segmented body ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0yMi1sb2JzdGVy) ) with a head, a
    thorax, and abdomen segments.
2.  Appendages on at least one segment. They can be used for feeding,
    sensory reception, defense, and locomotion. In addition to legs,
    antennas and mouth parts are considered modified appendages.
3.  A nervous system.
4.  A hard exoskeleton made of chitin, which gives them physical
    protection and resistance to drying out. In order to grow,
    arthropods shed this outer covering in a process called
    **molting** .
5.  An open circulatory system with **hemolymph** , a blood-like fluid.
    A series of hearts move the hemolymph into the body cavity where it
    comes in direct contact with the tissues. Hemolymph is involved with
    oxygen distribution.
6.  A complete digestive system with a mouth and an anus.
7.  Aquatic arthropods use gills to exchange gases. These gills have a
    large surface area in contact with the water, so they can absorb
    more oxygen.
8.  Land-living arthropods have internal surfaces that help
    exchange gasses. Insects and most other terrestrial species have a
    tracheal system, where air sacs lead into the body from pores in
    the exoskeleton. These pores cover a large part of their external
    body surface. Others use book lungs, gills modified for breathing
    air, as seen in species like the coconut crab. Some areas of the
    legs of soldier crabs are covered with an oxygen absorbing skin.
    Land crabs sometimes have two different structures: one used for
    breathing underwater, and another used to absorb oxygen from
    the air.

**What are shrimp?**

Shrimp are an example of crustaceans, one group within the arthropods.
Shrimp live on the ocean floor in many parts of the world. Shrimp are
not only food for humans; they are also an important food source for
larger marine animals.

### Crustaceans {#10.html#x-ck12-Q3J1c3RhY2VhbnM._13-oyt}

**Crustaceans** are a large group of arthropods, consisting of almost
52,000 species. The majority of crustaceans are aquatic. Some live in
the ocean, while others live in fresh water. A few groups have adapted
to living on land, such as land crabs, hermit crabs, and woodlice (
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0yNi13b29kbGljZQ..) ).
Crustaceans are among the most successful animals, and can be considered
the dominant aquatic animals. Though small, crustaceans are numerous
enough to be the main source of energy for large ocean mammals. They are
found as much in the oceans as insects are on land.

#### Classes of Crustaceans {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NlcyBvZiBDcnVzdGFjZWFucw.._13-ymn}

Six classes of crustaceans are generally recognized ( **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Y2xhc3Nlcy1vZi1jcnVzdGFjZWFucw..) ).

  **Class**       **Characteristics**                                                                                                              **Examples**
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Branchiopoda    Mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus.                                                             Brine shrimp
  Remipedia       A small class of blind organisms found in deep caves connected to salt water.                                                    Nectiopoda
  Cephalocarida   Small crustaceans, with an eyeless head covered by a horseshoe-shaped shield; has two pairs of antennae and two pairs of jaws.   Horseshoe shrimp
  Maxillopoda     Mostly small, with a small abdomen, and generally no appendages.                                                                 Barnacles, copepods
  Ostracoda       Small animals with bivalve shells.                                                                                               Seed shrimp
  Malacostraca    The largest class, with the largest and most familiar animals. This class has the greatest diversity of body forms.              Crabs, lobsters, shrimp, krill, woodlice

#### Can Crustaceans Move? {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2FuIENydXN0YWNlYW5zIE1vdmU__13-teq}

Remember that crustaceans are an arthropod subphylum, and that arthropod
means "jointed feet." As expected, the majority of crustaceans can move.
A few groups are parasitic and live attached to their hosts. Adult
barnacles ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfTVNfTFNfYmFybmFjbGU.) ) cannot move, so
they attach themselves headfirst to a rock or log.

#### Characteristics of Crustaceans {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIENydXN0YWNlYW5z_13-eqn}

Characteristics of crustaceans include:

1.  An exoskeleton that may be bound together, such as in the
    **carapace** , the thick back shield seen in many crustaceans that
    often forms a protective space for the gills.
2.  A main body cavity with an expanded circulatory system. Blood is
    pumped by a heart located near the back.
3.  A digestive system consisting of a straight tube that has a
    **gastric mill** for grinding food and a pair of digestive glands
    that absorb food.
4.  Structures that function like kidneys to remove wastes. These are
    located near the antennae.
5.  A brain that exists in the form of **ganglia** , or connections
    between nerve cells.
6.  Crustaceans periodically shed the outer skeleton, grow rapidly for a
    short time, and then form another hard skeleton. They cannot grow
    underneath their outer exoskeleton. They are very vulnerable during
    this time, as they lack their hard shell.

#### Crustaceans Reproduction {#10.html#x-ck12-Q3J1c3RhY2VhbnMgUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_13-ahj}

Most crustaceans have separate sexes, so they reproduce sexually using
eggs and sperm. Many land crustaceans, such as the Christmas Island red
crab, mate every season and return to the sea to release the eggs.
Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land when the environment is
damp. In some crustaceans, the females keep the eggs until they hatch
into free-swimming larvae.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-dx9}

**How many legs does a centipede have?**

You might think that centipedes have a hundred legs. But many species of
centipedes don't have quite that many legs! The common house centipide
has only 15 pairs of legs.

### Centipededs and Millipedes {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2VudGlwZWRlZHMgYW5kIE1pbGxpcGVkZXM._14-8qn}

**Centipedes** and **millipedes** belong to the subphylum Myriapoda,
which contains 13,000 species. They all live on land, which makes sense
as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle, as
opposed to an aquatic lifestyle.

The Myriapoda are divided among four classes: (1) Chilopoda
(centipedes), (2) Diplopoda (millipedes), (3) Symphyla (symphylans), and
(4) Pauropoda (pauropods). They range from having over 750 legs to
having fewer than ten legs. They have a single pair of antennae and
simple eyes.

#### Habitat {#10.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdA.._14-lby}

Myriapoda are mostly found in moist forests, where they help to break
down decaying plant material. A few live in grasslands, semi-arid
habitats, or even deserts. Most myriapods are decomposers, with the
majority herbivores breaking down decaying plant material, but
centipedes are nighttime predators. Centipedes roam around looking for
small animals to bite and eat; their prey includes insects, spiders, and
other small invertebrates. If the centipede is large enough, it will
even attack small vertebrates, like lizards. Although not generally
considered dangerous to humans, many from this group can cause temporary
blistering and discoloration of the skin.

#### Centipedes {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2VudGlwZWRlcw.._14-zwp}

Centipedes ("hundred feet") ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0yNy1DZW50aXBlZGU.) ) are fast,
predatory carnivores, and venomous. There are around 3,300 described
species, ranging from one tiny species (less than half an inch in
length) to one giant species (the Peruvian giant yellow-leg centipede or
Amazonian giant centipede), which may grow larger than 12 inches. This
giant centipede has been known to attack, kill and eat much larger
animals, including tarantulas. Centipedes have one pair of legs per body
segment, with the first pair of legs behind the head modified into a
pair of fangs containing a poison gland. Many centipedes also guard
their eggs and young by curling around them.

</div>

#### Millipedes {#10.html#x-ck12-TWlsbGlwZWRlcw.._14-mth}

Most millipedes are slower than centipedes and feed on leaf litter and
loose organic material. They can be distinguished from centipedes by
looking at the number of legs per body segment. Millipedes have two
pairs of legs per body segment, while centipedes have a single pair of
legs per body segment. Millipedes protect their eggs from predators by
using a nest of hard soil. Millipedes are not poisonous. They lack the
pair of fangs containing a poison gland that centipedes have.

#### Symphyla {#10.html#x-ck12-U3ltcGh5bGE._14-exs}

The third class, Symphyla, contains 200 species. **Symphylans** resemble
centipedes but are smaller and translucent. These arthropods have an
elongated body, with three pairs of thoracic legs and about nine pairs
of abdominal legs, giving this class 12 pairs total. Many spend their
lives in soil feeding on plant roots, but some do live in trees.

#### Pauropods {#10.html#x-ck12-UGF1cm9wb2Rz_14-joa}

The **pauropods** are typically 0.5-2.0 mm long and live on all
continents except Antarctica. They are usually found in soil, leaf
litter, or other moist places. They feed on fungi and decaying organic
matter, and are essentially harmless. Adult pauropods have 11 or 12 body
segments and 9-11 pairs of legs. They also possess unique forked
antennae and a distinctive pattern of movement characterized by rapid
burst of movement and frequent abrupt changes in direction. Over 700
species have been described, and they are believed to be closely related
to millipedes.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-r0j}

-   Myriapoda are usually found in moist forests, where they break down
    decaying plant material.
-   Millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while centipedes
    have a single pair of legs per body segment.

**Is a spider a type of insect?**

Although spiders and insects are both arthropods, a spider is not an
insect. One key difference is that insects have six legs, while spiders
have eight legs.

### Arachnids {#10.html#x-ck12-QXJhY2huaWRz_15-63z}

**Arachnids** are a class of joint-legged invertebrates in the subphylum
Chelicerata. They live mainly on land but are also found in fresh water
and in all marine environments, except for the open ocean. There are
over 100,000 named species, including many species of spiders,
scorpions, daddy-long-legs, ticks, and mites ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0yOC1hcmFjaG5pZHM.) ). There may be up
to 600,000 species in total, including unknown ones.

#### Characteristics of Arachnids {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEFyYWNobmlkcw.._15-nps}

Arachnids have the following characteristics:

1.  Four pairs of legs (eight total). You can tell the difference
    between an arachnid and an insect because insects have three pairs
    of legs (six total).
2.  Arachnids also have two additional pairs of appendages. The first
    pair, the **chelicerae** , serve in feeding and defense. The next
    pair, the **pedipalps** , help the organisms feed, move,
    and reproduce.
3.  Arachnids do not have antennae or wings.
4.  The arachnid body is organized into the **cephalothorax** , a fusion
    of the head and thorax, and the abdomen.
5.  To adapt to living on land, arachnids have internal breathing
    systems, like a trachea or a book lung.
6.  Arachnids are mostly carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies
    of insects and other small animals.
7.  Several groups are venomous. They release the venom from specialized
    glands to kill prey or enemies.
8.  Several mites are parasitic, and some of those are carriers
    of disease.
9.  Arachnids usually lay eggs, which hatch into immature arachnids that
    are similar to adults. Scorpions, however, give birth to live young.

#### Arachnid Subgroups {#10.html#x-ck12-QXJhY2huaWQgU3ViZ3JvdXBz_15-6zn}

The arachnids are divided into eleven subgroups. Below are the four most
familiar subgroups, with a description of each ( **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U3ViZ3JvdXBzLW9mLUFyYWNobmlkcw..) ).

**Are arthropods just creepy and scary?**

Many arthropods, such as scorpions, insects, and spiders, have a
reputation of being a nuisance or even harmful. But even if they are a
little scary to you, that doesn't mean that the world would be fine
without them.

### Importance of Arthropods {#10.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBBcnRocm9wb2Rz_16-hm1}

Have you ever been startled by a bee landing on a flower? Or surprised
by a swarm of pill bugs when you overturned a rock? These arthropods
might seem a little scary to you, but they are actually performing
important roles in the environment. Arthropods are important to the
ecosystem and to humans in many ways.

#### Arthropods as Food {#10.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aHJvcG9kcyBhcyBGb29k_16-sxq}

Many species of crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfbG9ic3RlcjI.) ), shrimp, prawns, and
crayfish, are consumed by humans, and are now farmed on a large
commercial scale. Nearly 10,000,000 tons of arthropods as food were
produced in 2005. Over 70% by weight of all crustaceans caught for
consumption are shrimp and prawns. Over 80% is produced in Asia, with
China producing nearly half the world’s total.

Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are
eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures. Beetles, locusts,
butterflies, ants, and stinkbugs (which have an apple flavor) are
insects that are regularly eaten by people in dozens of countries. In
fact, there are more than 1,900 edible insect species on Earth, hundreds
of which are already part of the diet of about two billion people
worldwide. This is just under one of every three people worldwide, and
this number should continue to grow in the future.

The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for
human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal
husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest
contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination.
Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the
world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and
increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate
crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of
food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and
bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and
other insects.

#### Arthropods in Pest Control {#10.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aHJvcG9kcyBpbiBQZXN0IENvbnRyb2w._16-u7v}

Humans use mites to prey on unwanted arthropods on farms or in homes.
Other arthropods are used to control weed growth. Populations of whip
scorpions added to an environment can limit the populations of
cockroaches and crickets. Millipedes also control the harmful growth of
destructive fungi and bacteria. When the numbers of millipedes is low,
the imbalance between predator and prey can cause harmful microorganisms
to flourish, and it can became difficult to manage plagues and diseases
through natural processes.

Cockroaches, spiders, mites, ticks and all other insects considered as
carnivorous, prey on smaller species to maintain ecological balance.
Thus, communities that have a good balance of these arthropods tend to
have better pest control.

#### Ecological Roles {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9naWNhbCBSb2xlcw.._16-tg8}

Many arthropods have extremely important roles in ecosystems. Arthropods
are of ecological importance because of their sheer numbers and extreme
diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths,
flies and beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and
grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are
transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about,
either by walking or flying. Most plants actually produce scents to send
signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available.

Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are **decomposers** , meaning
they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into soil
nutrients. This is an important role because it supplies the plants with
the minerals and nutrients necessary for life. It also keeps dead
material from accumulating in the environment. Plants then pass along
those minerals and nutrients to the animals that eat the plants.

#### Human Uses {#10.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gVXNlcw.._16-qfe}

Arthropods are also invaluable to humans, as they are used in many
different human-made products. Examples are:

-   Bees produce honey and their honeycombs contain beeswax, widely used
    for making candles, furniture wax and polishes, waxed papers,
    antiseptics, and fillings for surgical uses.
-   The pollens stored in honeycombs were discovered to have a rich
    mixture of vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids that could provide
    medical benefits. They were used as ingredients for supplements and
    medications that could provide relief for colds, asthma, and
    hay fever.
-   Silk produced by arthropods, like those produced by caterpillars to
    protect their cocoons, is strong enough to use and be woven into
    fabrics, a discovery first used in ancient China's silk industry.
-   The spiders’ web was discovered as an additional material that could
    provide strength, and has became essential raw materials for Kevlar
    vests, fishing nets, surgical sutures, and adhesives, as they
    contained natural antiseptics.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-osb}

-   Many crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters, shrimp, prawns, and
    crayfish, are food sources for humans.
-   Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning
    they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into
    soil nutrients.

**What animals were the first to evolve wings?**

When someone says the word "wing," you probably think of soaring birds.
Or maybe chicken wings smothered in hot sauce. But insects were actually
the first animals to evolve wings.

### What are Insects {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgSW5zZWN0cw.._17-po6}

Insects, with over a million described species, are the most diverse
group of animals on Earth. They may be found in nearly all environments
on the planet. No matter where you travel, you will see organisms from
this group. Adult insects range in size from a minuscule fairy fly to a
21.9-inch-long stick insect ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zMS1zdGljay1pbnNlY3Q.) ).

#### Characteristics of Insects {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEluc2VjdHM._17-bfv}

Characteristics of Insects include:

-   Segmented bodies with an **exoskeleton** . The outer layer of the
    exoskeleton is called the **cuticle** . It is made up of two layers.
    The outer layer, or **exocuticle** , is thin, waxy,
    and water-resistant. The inner layer is much thicker. The exocuticle
    is extremely thin in many soft-bodied insects, such as caterpillars.
-   The segments of the body are organized into three distinct but
    joined units: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zMy1odW1hbi1pbnNlY3Q.) and
    **Table**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6SW5zZWN0LVN0cnVjdHVyZXM.) ).

A diagram of a human and an insect, comparing the three main body parts:
head, thorax, and abdomen.

</div>

  **Structure**   **Description**
  --------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Head            A pair of antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and three sets of appendages that form the mouthparts.
  Thorax          Six segmented legs and two or four wings.
  Abdomen         Contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive structures.

-   A nervous system that is divided into a brain and a ventral
    nerve cord.
-   Respiration that occurs without lungs. Insects have a system of
    internal tubes and sacs that oxygen travels through to reach
    body tissues. Air is taken in through the **spiracles** , openings
    on the sides of the abdomen.
-   A closed digestive system, with one long enclosed coiled tube which
    runs lengthwise through the body, from the mouth to the anus.
-   A circulatory system that is simple and consists of only a single
    tube with openings. The tube pulses and circulates blood-like fluids
    inside the body cavity.
-   Various types of movement. Insect movement can include flight,
    walking, and swimming. Insects were the only invertebrates to
    develop the ability to fly, and this has played an important role in
    their success. Many adult insects use six legs for walking, and they
    walk in alternate triangles touching the ground. This allows the
    insect to walk quickly while staying stable. A few insects have
    evolved to walk on the surface of the water, like water striders (
    **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zNC13YXRlci1zdHJpZGVycw..) ). A
    large number of other insects also live parts of their
    lives underwater. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted to
    paddle in the water. Young dragonflies use jet propulsion, sending
    water out of their back end to move.

#### Communication in Insects {#10.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbiBpbiBJbnNlY3Rz_17-7lh}

Insects use many different senses for both communicating and receiving
information. The types of communication that are used by various insects
are summarized below ( **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6SW5zZWN0LUNvbW11bmljYXRpb24.) ).

#### Insects are Social {#10.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0cyBhcmUgU29jaWFs_17-6oi}

Social insects, such as termites, ants, and many bees and wasps (
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zNi1pbnNlY3QtYmVoYXZpb3I.)
), are the most familiar social species. They live together in large,
well-organized colonies. Only those insects which live in nests or
colonies can home. **Homing** means that an insect can return to a
single hole among many other apparently identical holes, even after a
long trip or after a long time.

A few insects migrate in groups. For example, the monarch butterfly
flies between Mexico and North America each spring and fall ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zNi1pbnNlY3QtYmVoYXZpb3I.) ).

#### Two Major Groups of Insects {#10.html#x-ck12-VHdvIE1ham9yIEdyb3VwcyBvZiBJbnNlY3Rz_17-t1o}

Insects are divided into two major groups:

1.  Wingless: Consists of two orders, the bristle tails and
    the silverfish.
2.  Winged insects: All other orders of insects. They are named below.

Mayflies; dragonflies and damselflies; stoneflies; webspinners; angel
insects; earwigs; grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids; stick insects;
ice-crawlers and gladiators; cockroaches and termites; mantids; lice;
thrips; true bugs, aphids, and cicadas; wasps, bees, and ants; beetles;
twisted-winged parasites; snakeflies; alderflies and dobsonflies;
lacewings and antlions; hangingflies (including fleas); true flies;
caddisflies; and butterflies, moths, and skippers.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-djo}

-   Characteristics of insects include segmented bodies, a system of
    internal tubes and sacs through which oxygen travels, and a simple
    circulatory system.
-   Insects use many types of communication, including bioluminescence,
    sounds, and phermones.
-   Some insects are social and live in groups.

**How do butterflies eat?**

You might have seen butterflies searching for food on a flower before.
They have long, tube-like mouthparts that can reach deep within a
flower. The butterfly uses this mouth-tube to siphon nectar from the
flower, as if sucking through a straw.

### Insect Food {#10.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0IEZvb2Q._18-hte}

What do insets eat? Practically anything they want. There are so many
different insects, that among all of them, no potential food is safe.
Lots of insects eat plants, some insects eat other insects, and some
even drink blood. Many insects eat nectar from plants. And some insects
will eat whatever scraps of food you leave lying around.

A few insects, such as mayflies and some moths, never eat. That’s
because their lives are over in just a few hours or days. Once these
insects become adults, they lay eggs, and then die. On the other hand,
some insects are very healthy eaters. A silkworm eats enough leaves to
increase its weight more than 4,000 times in just 56 days, as the
silkworm increases in size about 10,000 times since birth. A locust eats
its own weight in plants every day. Just imagine eating your own weight
in food every day. You probably couldn't. You would most likely get very
sick even if you tried.

#### How do Insects Eat? {#10.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIEluc2VjdHMgRWF0Pw.._18-dmy}

Insects eat in many different ways and they eat a huge range of foods.
Around half are plant-eaters, feeding on leaves, roots, seeds, nectar,
or wood. Aphids and leafhoppers suck up the sap from plants. Praying
mantises are predators, hunting other small creatures, including insects
like moths, caterpillars, flies, beetles, and spiders. Insects like
mosquitoes and aphids have special mouthparts that help them pierce and
suck. Others, like assassin bugs ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZWF0YnVn) ) and certain species of
female mosquitoes, eat other insects. Fleas and lice are parasites,
eating the flesh or blood of larger animals without killing them.

Insects have different types of appendages (arms and legs) adapted for
capturing and feeding on prey. They also have special senses that help
them detect prey. Furthermore, insects have a wide range of mouthparts
used for feeding.

Examples of chewing insects include dragonflies, grasshoppers, and
beetles. These insects use one pair of jaws to bite off bits of food and
grind them down. Another pair of jaws helps to push the food down the
throat. Some larvae also have chewing mouthparts, as in the caterpillar
stages of moths and butterflies ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zMi1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcnM.) ).

Some insects use siphoning, as if sucking through a straw, like moths
and butterflies. This long mouth-tube that they use to suck up the
nectar of the flower is called a **proboscis** . Some moths, however,
have no mouthparts at all. Some insects obtain food by **sponging** ,
like the housefly. Sponging means that the mouthpart can absorb liquid
food and send it to the esophagus. The housefly is able to eat solid
food by releasing saliva and dabbing it over the food. As the saliva
dissolves the food, the sponging mouthpart absorbs the liquid food.

  **Method**         **Description**                                               **Examples**

**What is this?**

These butterfly eggs look like tiny pearls on a leaf. The adult
butterfly often lays her eggs on a specific type of plant. This ensures
that the future caterpillars will have plenty of food to eat.

### Insect Reproduction and Life Cycle {#10.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0IFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbiBhbmQgTGlmZSBDeWNsZQ.._19-log}

Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time.
With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can quickly adjust
to environmental changes. Most insects reproduce by **sexual
reproduction** . The female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the
male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food. In
some insects, there is **asexual reproduction** during which the
offspring come from a single parent. In this type of reproduction, the
offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in
aphids and scale insects.

With a few exceptions, all insect life begins as an egg. After leaving
the egg, insects must grow and transform until reaching adulthood. Only
the adult insect can mate and reproduce. The physical transformation of
an insect from one stage of its life cycle to another is known as
**metamorphosis** .

#### Three Types of Metamorphosis {#10.html#x-ck12-VGhyZWUgVHlwZXMgb2YgTWV0YW1vcnBob3Npcw.._19-kl2}

An insect can have one of three types of metamorphosis and life cycles (
**Table** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6bWV0YW1vcnBob3Npcw..) ).
Metamorphosis describes how insects transform from an immature or young
insect into an adult insect in at least two stages. Insects may undergo
gradual metamorphosis (incomplete), where transformation is subtle, or
complete metamorphosis, where each stage of the life cycle appears quite
different from the others. In some insects, there may be no true
metamorphosis at all.

**Would you like to try a grasshopper taco?**

It might seem disgusting to you, but insects are an important food
source in many places across the globe. Crickets, ants, grasshoppers,
and other insects are traditional foods in parts of Latin America,
Africa, and Asia.

### Importance of Insects {#10.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBJbnNlY3Rz_20-lyv}

Many insects are considered to be pests by humans. However, insects are
also very important for numerous reasons.

#### Ecological Importance {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9naWNhbCBJbXBvcnRhbmNl_20-tad}

Insects can be found in every environment on Earth. While a select few
insects, such as the Arctic Wooly Bear Moth, live in the harsh Arctic
climate, the majority of insects are found in the warm and moist
tropics. Insects have adapted to a broad range of habitats, successfully
finding their own niche, because they will eat almost any substance that
has nutritional value.

Insects are crucial components of many ecosystems, where they perform
many important functions. They aerate the soil, pollinate blossoms, and
control insect and plant pests. Many insects, especially beetles, are
scavengers, feeding on dead animals and fallen trees, thereby recycling
nutrients back into the soil. As **decomposers** , insects help create
top soil, the nutrient-rich layer of soil that helps plants grow.
Burrowing bugs, such as ants and beetles, dig tunnels that provide
channels for water, benefiting plants. Bees, wasps, butterflies, and
ants **pollinate** flowering plants ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfcG9sbGluYXRpb24.) ). Gardeners love the
big-eyed bug and praying mantis because they control the size of certain
insect populations, such as aphids and caterpillars, which feed on new
plant growth. Finally, all insects fertilize the soil with the nutrients
from their droppings.

#### Economic Importance {#10.html#x-ck12-RWNvbm9taWMgSW1wb3J0YW5jZQ.._20-c8c}

Insects have tremendous economic importance. Some insects produce useful
substances, such as honey, wax, lacquer, and silk. Honeybees have been
raised by humans for thousands of years for honey. The silkworm greatly
affected human history. When the Chinese used worms to develop silk, the
silk trade connected China to the rest of the world. Adult insects, such
as crickets, as well as insect larvae, are also commonly used as fishing
bait.

#### Insects as Food {#10.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0cyBhcyBGb29k_20-gd2}

Insects, of course, are not just eaten by people. Insects are the sole
food source for many amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, making
their roles in food chains and food webs extremely important. It is
possible that food webs could collapse if insect populations decline.

In some parts of the world, insects are used for food by humans. Insects
are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and are prized as
delicacies in many third-world countries. In fact, it is difficult to
find an insect that is not eaten in one form or another by people. Among
the most popular are cicadas, locusts, mantises, grubs, caterpillars,
crickets, ants, and wasps. Many people support this idea to provide a
source of protein in human nutrition. From South America to Japan,
people eat roasted insects, like grasshoppers or beetles.

#### Insects in Medicine {#10.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0cyBpbiBNZWRpY2luZQ.._20-jbu}

Insects have also been used in medicine. In the past, fly larvae (
**maggots** ) were used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene.
Gangrene is caused by infection of dead flesh. Maggots only eat dead
flesh, so when they are placed on the dead flesh of humans, they
actually clean the wound and can prevent infection. Some hospitals still
use this type of treatment.

**Are ladybugs dangerous?**

Ladybugs won't hurt you. But they are dangerous to some other insects!
This ladybug is eating plant-harming bugs known as aphids. Since they
have an appetite for aphids, ladybugs are a farmer's friend.

### Control of Insects {#10.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbCBvZiBJbnNlY3Rz_21-ze6}

Though insects can be very important, some are also considered pests.
Common insect pests include:

1.  Parasitic insects, such as mosquitoes, lice, and bed bugs.
2.  Insects that transmit diseases, including mosquitoes and flies.
3.  Insects that damage structures, such as termites ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMi0zNi10ZXJtaXRlLW5lc3QtZGFtYWdl) ).
4.  Insects that destroy crops, including locusts and weevils.

Many scientists who study insects are involved in various forms of pest
control. Most utilize insect-killing chemicals, but more and more rely
on other methods. Ways to control insect pests are described below.

#### Biological Control {#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvbG9naWNhbCBDb250cm9s_21-fpl}

**Biological control** of pests in farming is a method of controlling
pests by using other insects (or other natural predators of the pests).
Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism. Insect
predators, such as ladybugs and lacewings, consume a large number of
other insects during their lifetime. If you add ladybugs to your farm or
garden, they will help keep insect pests, such as aphids, under control.
Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants
in temperate regions, so any control of these pests is beneficial.

Ladybugs also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The
larvae of many hoverfly species also feed upon aphids, with one larva
consuming up to fifty aphids a day, which is about 1,000 in its
lifetime. They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars.
Dragonflies are important predators of mosquitoes, and can be used to
control this pest. Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and
flies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is
then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately
killed. Caterpillars also tend to be one likely target of parasitic
wasps.

#### Chemical Control {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgQ29udHJvbA.._21-49h}

Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides.
**Insecticides** , which are also known as pesticides, are most often
used to kill insects. Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects. The
U.S. spends \$9 billion each year on pesticides. Disadvantages to using
pesticides include human, fish, and honeybee poisonings, and the
contamination of meat and dairy products.

When choosing to use an insecticide, there are numerous points to
consider. Negative effects of the pesticide should try to be minimized.
Important questions to consider include the following.

-   What is the chemical's success against the target pest? Will the
    insecticide provide the desired level of control of the pest? If the
    answer is no, other methods of control should be considered.

<!-- -->

-   Does the chemical have an impact on natural enemies of the pest? In
    large scale efforts to rid areas of mosquitoes, the insecticide used
    also killed the dragonfly. This effort removed a natural predator of
    the mosquito. This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using
    the insecticide.

<!-- -->

-   How susceptible is the crop to insect damage? If the crop is not
    heavily damaged, only minor pest control may be needed. This may
    affect the amount or type of insecticide used.

<!-- -->

-   How toxic is the chemical to the environment and humans? Some older
    insecticides are extremely poisonous. Keep in mind that users of
    these poisons have a community responsibility to minimize the
    contamination of the surrounding environment, as well as keeping
    animals, surrounding crops and humans safe.

<!-- -->

-   Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance? If
    so, this can make additional use of the pesticide less effective. As
    the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect
    (which is natural selection in action), this could be considered a
    negative side-effect of pesticide use.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-czp}

-   Harmful insects include those that can destroy buildings and crops
    or transmit disease.
-   Insecticides are commonly used to control insect pests, but they can
    have harmful effects on the environment.

## Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-nux}

Invertebrates describes eight invertebrate phyla with the greatest
number of species. From the simple sponge to the echinodermata, this
diverse group of organisms is anything but simple. Essentially, the only
common characteristic among all the groups is the lack of a backbone.
Many people may not even recognize the sponge as an animal. But it is.
And how many people think a worm is an insect? But it is not. Add to
this group all the different species of insects, and the diverseness of
this group is easily apparent.

**What do these two animals have in common with you?**

Notice the orange fish. Around him is another type of animal, a
tunicate, in blue. Tunicates, fish, and humans seem very different from
one another, but they do have some things in common. They are all
chordates.

### Chordates {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hvcmRhdGVz-dlk}

Did you know that fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are all
related? They are all chordates. **Chordates** are a group of animals
that includes vertebrates, as well as several closely related
invertebrates. Chordates (phylum *Chordata* ) are named after a feature
they all share, a notochord. A **notochord** is a hollow nerve cord
along the back.

#### Characteristics of the Chordates {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIHRoZSBDaG9yZGF0ZXM.-wgf}

Chordates are defined by a set of four characteristics that are shared
by these animals at some point during their development. In some
chordates, all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve
important functions. However, in many chordates, including humans, some
traits are present only during the embryonic stage. After that, these
traits may disappear.

All chordates have four main traits ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTMyLWNob3JkYXRlLWJvZHktcGxhbg..) ):

1.  **Post-anal tail** : The tail is opposite the head and extends past
    the anus.
2.  **Dorsal hollow nerve cord** : "Dorsal" means that the nerve cord
    runs along the top of the animal. In some animals, the nerve cord
    develops into the brain and spinal cord.
3.  Notochord: The notochord lies below the nerve cord. It is a rigid
    structure where muscles attach.
4.  **Pharyngeal slits** : Pharyngeal slits are used to filter out food
    from water by some simple chordates. In most chordates, however,
    they are only present during the embryonic stages and serve no
    apparent purpose.

**Figure 11.1**

Body Plan of a Typical Chordate. The body plan of a chordate includes a
post-anal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal
slits.

</div>

#### Classification of the Chordates {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgdGhlIENob3JkYXRlcw..-pzi}

The chordates are divided into nine classes. Five of the classes are the
fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There are actually five
classes of marine chordates (for example, sharks are cartilaginous fish
which are distinct from bony fish), and these will be discussed in
additional concepts.

The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla:

1.  Urochordata: The tunicates, pictured in the introduction, make up
    this group. The urochordates are sessile (non-moving) marine animals
    with sack-like bodies and tubes for water movement. Urochordates
    have a notochord and nerve cord only during the larval stage.
2.  Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates include the lancelets ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfbGFuY2VsZXQ.) ), fish-like marine
    animals often found half-buried in the sand. Cephalochordates have a
    notochord and nerve cord but no backbone.
3.  Vertebrata: Humans and other mammals, along with fish, amphibians,
    reptiles, and birds, fall in this category. In vertebrates, the
    notochord is typically smaller and surrounded by a backbone.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-hvh}

-   Chordates are animals that have a notochord, post-anal tail, dorsal
    hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.
-   Chordates include all vertebrates and some invertebrates.

( *Note* : this resource refers to human embryos as having gill slits.
This is a commonly held misconception which seems to have originated in
a now defunct theory by Ernst Haeckel. In the embryonic development of
chordates, there is a stage where an invagination, called "gill pouches"
or "pharyngeal pouches," appear in vertebrate embryos. This invagination
does develop into gills in some species, but in other species the
invagination develops into other structures. So, while parallels in the
development of chordates are accurate, it is misleading to say human
embryos have gill slits. You can find out more here

**What animals have a backbone?**

You have a backbone, or vertebrate (or vertebral) column. Can you guess
what other animals also have a backbone? Frogs, snakes, birds, and many
other animals all have backbones. Animals that have backbones are known
as vertebrates.

### Introduction to Vertebrates {#11.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIFZlcnRlYnJhdGVz_1-gzm}

**Vertebrates** are animals with backbones. These include fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

#### Characteristics of Vertebrates {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFZlcnRlYnJhdGVz_1-des}

The primary feature shared by all vertebrates is the **vertebral
column** , or backbone. The vertebral column protects the spinal cord.

Other typical vertebrate traits include:

-   The **cranium** (skull) to protect the brain. The brain is attached
    to the spinal cord.
-   An internal skeleton. The internal skeleton supports the animal,
    protects internal organs, and allows for movement.
-   A defined head region with a brain. The head region has an
    accumulation of sense organs.

Living vertebrates range in size from a carp species, as little as 0.3
inches, to the blue whale, which can be as large as 110 feet (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0wMy1zaXplLWNvbXBhcmlzb24.)

#### Classification of Vertebrates {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgVmVydGVicmF0ZXM._1-so7}

Vertebrates, or subphylum Vertebrata, are all members of the phylum
Chordata. Although there is some disagreement on how to classify
animals, the traditional system divides the vertebrates into seven
classes ( **Table** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-VmVydGVicmF0ZUNsYXNz) ).

  **Class**        **Common Name**        **Characteristics**                                                                                                    **Examples**

**Is this animal a fish?**

This mudskipper might not seem like a fish. It's not swimming in a lake
or an ocean, and it appears to be using its fins like legs. Mudskippers
can breathe through their skin and burrow in the mud, essentially living
on land for a brief amount of time. These features are not typical of
fish, and, yet, mudskippers are still classified as fish. So what
features define a fish?

### Characteristics of Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEZpc2g._2-fif}

What exactly is a fish? You probably think the answer is obvious. You
may say that a fish is an animal that swims in the ocean or a lake,
using fins. But as we saw with the mudskipper, not all fish spend all
their time in water. So how do scientists define fish?

Some characteristics of fish include:

1.  They are **ectothermic** , meaning their temperature depends on the
    temperature of their environment. Ectothermic animals are
    cold-blooded in that they cannot raise their body temperature on
    their own. This is unlike humans, whose temperature is controlled
    from inside the body.
2.  They are covered with scales.
3.  They have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins.
4.  They also have a streamlined body that allows them to swim rapidly.

Fish are aquatic vertebrates, meaning they have backbones. They became a
dominant form of sea life and eventually evolved into land vertebrates.
There are three classes of fish: Class Agnatha (the jawless fish), Class
Chondrichthyes (the cartilaginous fish), and Class Osteichthyes (the
bony fish). All have the characteristics of fish in common, though there
are differences unique to each class.

#### How do Fish Breathe? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIEZpc2ggQnJlYXRoZT8._2-kb3}

In order to absorb oxygen from the water, fish use gills ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0wNi1GaXNoLWdpbGxz) ). **Gills** take
dissolved oxygen from water as the water flows over the surface of the
gill.

</div>

#### How Do Fish Reproduce? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvIEZpc2ggUmVwcm9kdWNlPw.._2-hbz}

Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either
inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of
the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also
takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release
their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs.
Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of
fertilization.

#### How Big Are Fish? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IEJpZyBBcmUgRmlzaD8._2-jo7}

Fish range in size from the 65-foot, 75,000 pound whale shark (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0wNy13aGFsZS1zaGFyaw..) )
to the stout infantfish, which is about 0.33 inches (8.4 mm), and the
*Paedocypris progenetica* carp species of the Indonesian island of
Sumatra, which is about 0.31 inches (7.9 mm) long, making it also the
smallest known vertebrate animal. The second-largest fish is the basking
shark, which grows to about 40 feet and 8,000 pounds. Both of the large
sharks may look ferocious, and would probably scare anyone who comes
across one in the water, but both species are filter-feeders, and feed
on tiny fish and plankton. The tiny carp species is unique in that it
has the appearance of larvae, with a reduced skeleton lacking a cranium,
which leaves the brain unprotected by bone. The fish lives in dark
acidic waters, having a pH of 3. Keep in mind that whales are not fish,
they are mammals.

#### Exceptions to Common Fish Traits {#11.html#x-ck12-RXhjZXB0aW9ucyB0byBDb21tb24gRmlzaCBUcmFpdHM._2-wa9}

There are exceptions to many of these fish traits. For example, tuna,
swordfish, and some species of shark show some warm-blooded adaptations
and are able to raise their body temperature significantly above that of
the water around them.

Some species of fish have a slower, more maneuverable swimming style,
like eels and rays ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0wOC1zdGluZ3JheQ..) ). Body shape and
the arrangement of fins are highly variable, and the surface of the skin
may be naked, as in moray eels, or covered with scales. Scales can be of
a variety of different types.

#### Why Fish are Important {#11.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEZpc2ggYXJlIEltcG9ydGFudA.._2-h2d}

How are fish important? Of course, they are used as food ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0xNS1jYXRmaXNoLWhhcnZlc3Q.) ). In
fact, people all over the world either catch fish in the wild or farm
them in much the same way as cattle or chickens. Farming fish is known
as **aquaculture** . Fish are also caught for recreation to display in
the home or in a public aquarium.

**What is this organism?**

With this huge sucker lined with teeth, this organism might look like
something out of science fiction. But this is a real fish found in the
ocean, known as a lamprey. They use their teeth and sucker to bore into
other fish and suck their blood. The lamprey is an example of a jawless
fish.

### Jawless Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-SmF3bGVzcyBGaXNo_3-npb}

What defines a jawless fish? You can probably guess. A jawless fish is a
fish without a jaw. But there are other features that are shared by this
class of organisms. Why would such an organism evolve? These fish were
the first vertebrates to evolve. Logically, this makes sense, in that
the vertebral column would evolve first, with the more complex jaw bones
evolving later. The early jawless fish are thought to have relied on
filter feeding to capture their food, and most likely would have sucked
water and debris from the seafloor into their mouth, releasing water and
waste out of their gills. As other sea life evolved, these jawless fish
began to feed on other fish species, and are now considered a pest in
their habitat. Lampreys have no natural predators.

#### Features of Jawless Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgSmF3bGVzcyBGaXNo_3-wyb}

Jawless fish are missing the following parts:

1.  Jaws.
2.  Paired fins.
3.  A stomach.

Characteristics they do have include:

1.  A notochord, both in larvae and adults. Recall a **notochord** is a
    support rod that runs along the back of the fish.
2.  Seven or more paired **gill pouches** . These organs take dissolved
    oxygen from water.
3.  The **branchial arches** , a series of arches that support the gills
    of aquatic amphibians and fishes. They lie close to the
    body's surface.
4.  A light sensitive **pineal eye** , an eye-like structure that can
    detect light.
5.  A **cartilaginous skeleton** , a skeleton made of a flexible
    rubber-like supportive material called cartilage. This is similar to
    the skeleton of cartilaginous fish, which includes sharks and rays.
6.  A heart with two chambers.
7.  Reproduction using external fertilization.
8.  They are **ectothermic** . This means that their internal
    temperature depends on the temperature of their environment.

#### Classification of Jawless Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgSmF3bGVzcyBGaXNo_3-b7n}

Most scientists agree that the jawless fish are part of the the
superclass Agnatha. They belong to the phylum Chordata, subphylum
Vertebrata. There are two living groups of jawless fish, with about 100
species in total: lampreys and hagfish ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0xMC1IYWdmaXNo) ). Although hagfish
belong to the subphylum Vertebrata, they do not technically have
vertebrae (though they do have a skull), whereas lampreys do have
vertebrae. For this reason, scientists still disagree on the
classification of jawless fish.

**How are these organisms different?**

The two rays and the other fish pictured here do have a lot in common.
They have streamlined bodies well suited for movement in the ocean. One
difference, however, is their skeletons. The lone fish has a skeleton of
bone. The rays have a skeleton of cartilage, and so they are known as
cartilaginous fish.

### Cartilaginous Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2FydGlsYWdpbm91cyBGaXNo_4-58d}

The 1,000 or so species of **cartilaginous fish** are subdivided into
two subclasses: the first includes sharks, rays, and skates; the second
includes chimaera, sometimes called ghost sharks. Fish from this group
range in size from the dwarf lanternshark, at 6.3 inches, to the over
50-foot whale shark. Sharks obviously have jaws, as do the other
cartilaginous fish. These fish evolved from the jawless fish. So why did
fish eventually evolve to have jaws? Such an adaptation would allow fish
to eat a much wider variety of food, including plants and other
organisms.

Other characteristics of cartilaginous fish include:

-   Paired fins.
-   Paired nostrils.
-   Scales.
-   Two-chambered hearts.
-   Skeletons made of **cartilage** rather than bone. Cartilage is
    supportive tissue that does not have as much calcium as bones, which
    makes bones rigid. Cartilage is softer and more flexible than bone.

#### Blood, Skin, and Teeth {#11.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QsIFNraW4sIGFuZCBUZWV0aA.._4-tc5}

Since they do not have bone marrow (as they have no bones), red blood
cells are produced in the spleen, in special tissue around the
reproductive organs, and in an organ called **Leydig’s organ** , only
found in cartilaginous fishes. The tough skin of this group of fish is
covered with **placoid scales** , which are hard scales formed from
modified teeth. The scales are covered with a hard enamel. The hard
covering and the way the scales are arranged, gives the fish skin rough,
sandpaper-like feel. The function of these scales is for protection
against predators.

The shape of sharks' teeth differ according to their diet. Species that
feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense flattened teeth for
crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping,
and those that feed on larger prey, such as mammals, have pointed lower
teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for
cutting. Sharks continually shed and replace their teeth, with some
shedding as much as 35,000 teeth in a lifetime.

#### Superorders {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJvcmRlcnM._4-maj}

The sharks, rays, and skates (which are similar to stingrays) are
further broken into two superorders:

1.  Rays and skates.
2.  Sharks.

Sharks are some of the most frequently studied cartilaginous fish.
Sharks are distinguished by such features as:

-   The number of gill slits.
-   The number and type of fins.
-   The type of teeth.
-   The size of their jaws.
-   Body shape.
-   Their activity at night.
-   An elongated, toothed snout used for slashing the fish that they
    eat, as seen in sawsharks.
-   Teeth used for grasping and crushing shellfish, a characteristic of
    bullhead sharks.
-   A whisker-like organ named **barbels** that help sharks find food, a
    characteristic of carpet sharks.
-   A long snout (or nose-like area), characteristic of groundsharks.
-   **Ovoviviparous** reproduction, where the eggs develop inside the
    mother’s body after internal fertilization, and the young are
    born alive. This trait is characteristic of mackerel sharks. All
    sharks mate by internal fertilization. Some sharks then lay their
    eggs, others allow internal development.

**Can fish have bones?**

Of course. Many fish have bones. They serve the same function as our
bones: protection and support. Notice how the skeleton protects the
fish's brain. Also, notice the bones along the body of the fish would
allow muscles to attach to aid in movement.

### Bony Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-Qm9ueSBGaXNo_5-pq2}

There are about 27,000 species of bony fish ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTExLWJvbnktZmlzaC1maW5z) ), which are
divided into two classes: ray-finned fish and lobe-finned fish. Most
bony fish are ray-finned. These thin fins consist of webs of skin over
flexible spines. Lobe-finned fish, on the other hand, have fins that

#### Characteristics of Bony Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEJvbnkgRmlzaA.._5-srg}

Most fish are bony fish, making them the largest group of vertebrates in
existence today. They are characterized by:

1.  A head and **pectoral girdles** (arches supporting the forelimbs)
    that are covered with bones derived from the skin.
2.  A lung or **swim bladder** , which helps the body create a balance
    between sinking and floating by either filling up with or emitting
    gases such as oxygen. Controlling the volume of this organ helps
    fish control their depth.
3.  Jointed, segmented rods supporting the fins.
4.  A cover over the gill called the **operculum** , which helps them
    breathe without having to swim.
5.  The ability to see in color, unlike most other fish.

#### Ray-finned Fish {#11.html#x-ck12-UmF5LWZpbm5lZCBGaXNo_5-gwe}

Most vertebrates are ray-finned fish, with close to 27,000 known
species. By comparison, there are "only" about 10,000 species of
birds. The ray-finned fish have fin rays, with fins supported by bony
spines known as rays. The ray-finned fish are the dominant class of
vertebrates, with nearly 99% of fish falling into this category. They
live in all aquatic environments, from freshwater and marine
environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams.

#### Lobe-finned fish {#11.html#x-ck12-TG9iZS1maW5uZWQgZmlzaA.._5-fv2}

The lobe-finned fish are characterized by fleshy lobed fins, as opposed
to the bony fins of the ray-finned fish. There are two types of living
lobe-finned fish: the coelacanths and the lungfish. The pectoral and
pelvic fins have joints resembling those of tetrapod (four-limbed land
vertebrates) limbs. These fins evolved into legs of amphibians, the
first tetrapod land vertebrates. They also possess two dorsal fins with
separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin of ray-finned fish.
All lobe-finned fishes possess teeth covered with true enamel. The
lungfish also possess both gills and lungs, solidifying this class as
the ancestors of amphibians.

#### How Big Are Bony Fish? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IEJpZyBBcmUgQm9ueSBGaXNoPw.._5-m3n}

The ocean sunfish is the most massive bony fish in the world, up to 11
feet long and weighing up to 5,070 pounds ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0xNC1zdW5maXNo) ). Other very large
bony fish include the Atlantic blue marlin, the black marlin, some
sturgeon species, the giant grouper, and the goliath grouper. The
long-bodied oarfish can easily be over 30 feet long, but is not nearly
as massive as the ocean sunfish. In contrast, the dwarf pygmy goby
measures only 0.6 inches. Fish can also be quite valuable. In January
2013, at an auction in Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market, a 222-kilogram
(489-pound) tuna caught off northeastern Japan sold for 155.4 million
yen, which is \$1,760,000.

**What were the first land vertebrates?**

Amphibians! In order for water-dwelling animals to adapt to life on
land, many new adaptations had to take place. First, they needed to be
able to breathe air instead of obtaining oxygen from water. And fins
don't work well as legs! They needed to be able to move around well on
land.

### Characteristics of Amphibians {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEFtcGhpYmlhbnM._6-buv}

What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most
of its life on land? Amphibians! Amphibians are a group of vertebrates
that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are
born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on
land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with
their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary
amount of oxygen.

There are approximately 6,000 species of amphibians. They have many
different body types, physiologies, and habitats, ranging from tropical
to subarctic regions. Frogs, toads, salamanders ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0xNi1kdXNreS1zYWxhbWFuZGVy) ), newts,
and caecilians are all types of amphibians.

#### How did Amphibians Adapt to Living on Land? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRpZCBBbXBoaWJpYW5zIEFkYXB0IHRvIExpdmluZyBvbiBMYW5kPw.._6-pm8}

Transition to life on land meant significant changes to both external
and internal features. In order to live on land, amphibians replaced
gills with another respiratory organ, the lungs. Other adaptations
include:

-   Skin that prevents loss of water.
-   Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water.
-   An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the
    middle ear.
-   A tail that disappears in adulthood (in frogs and toads).

#### Classification of the Amphibians {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgdGhlIEFtcGhpYmlhbnM._6-slj}

Like fish, amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates. They belong to the
class Amphibia. There are three orders:

1.  Urodela, containing salamanders and newts.
2.  Anura, containing frogs and toads.
3.  Apoda, containing caecilians.

#### Where do Amphibians Live? {#11.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgZG8gQW1waGliaWFucyBMaXZlPw.._6-l4f}

Most amphibians live in fresh water, not salt water. Their habitats can
include areas close to springs, streams, rivers, lakes, swamps and
ponds. They can be found in moist areas in forests, meadows and marshes.
Amphibians can be found almost anywhere there is a source of fresh
water. Although there are no true saltwater amphibians, a few can live
in brackish (slightly salty) water. Some species do not need any water
at all, and several species have also adapted to live in drier
environments. Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs.

#### How do Amphibians Reproduce? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIEFtcGhpYmlhbnMgUmVwcm9kdWNlPw.._6-zfi}

Amphibians reproduce sexually. The life cycle of amphibians happens in
the following stages:

1.  Egg Stage: Amphibian eggs are fertilized in a number of ways.
    **External fertilization** , employed by most frogs and toads,
    involves a male gripping a female across her back, almost as if he
    is squeezing the eggs out of her. The male releases sperm over the
    female's eggs as they are laid. Another method is used by
    salamanders, whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto
    the ground. The female then pulls it into her **cloaca** , a single
    opening for her internal organ systems. Therefore, fertilization
    occurs internally. By contrast, caecilians and tailed frogs use
    **internal fertilization** , just like reptiles, birds, and mammals.
    The male deposits sperm directly into the female's cloaca.
2.  Larval stage: When the egg hatches, the organism is legless, lives
    in water, and breathes with gills, resembling their evolutionary
    ancestors (fish).
3.  During the larval stage, the amphibian slowly transforms into an
    adult by losing its gills and growing four legs. Once development is
    complete, it can live on land.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-val}

-   Amphibians live in both water and on land; amphibian larvae are born
    and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on
    land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and
    with their lungs.
-   Adaptations for land in amphibians include protective skin and
    eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water.

**What has the head of a frog and the body of a lizard?**

A salamander! You might have mistaken it for a lizard, but lizards are
very different from salamanders. Salamanders have moist skin, while
lizards have dry scales on their skin. Furthermore, lizards live their
entire lives on land. Salamanders must reproduce in water.

### Salamanders {#11.html#x-ck12-U2FsYW1hbmRlcnM._7-ats}

Salamanders are characterized by slender bodies, short legs, and long
tails. They are most closely related to the caecilians, little-known
legless amphibians ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0xNy1zYWxhbWFuZGVyLWNhZWNpbGlhbnM.) ).
Most of the animals in the salamander order look like a cross between a
lizard and a frog. They have moist, smooth skin like frogs and long
tails like lizards.

Salamanders are found in most moist or arid habitats in the Northern
Hemisphere, but can also be found south of the equator. They live on all
continents except Antarctica and Australia. Salamanders live in or near
water or on moist ground, often in a swamp. Some species live in water
most of their life, some live their entire adult life on land, and some
live in both habitats. Some salamanders live in caves. These salamanders
have pale skin and reduced eyes as they have adapted to living in
complete darkness in underground pools of water. The reduced eyes are
similar to other organisms that live in caves or underground.

Salamanders are **carnivorous** , eating only other animals, not plants.
They will eat almost any smaller animal, such as worms, centipedes,
crickets, spiders, and slugs. Some will even eat small invertebrates.
Finally, salamanders have the ability to grow back lost limbs, as well
as other body parts. This process is known as **regeneration.**

Salamanders have developed ways not to be eaten. Most salamanders have
brightly colored, poisonous skin. The bold color tells predators not to
eat the salamander. Many salamanders have glands on the back of the neck
or on the tail that give off a poisonous or bad-tasting liquid. Some
species can even shed their tail during an attack and grow a new one
later. Some salamanders stand high on its legs and waves its tail to
scare away danger. One particular salamander, the ribbed newt, has
needle-like rib tips. It can squeeze its muscles to make the rib tips
pierce through its skin and into its enemy, telling the predator to stay
away, a feature unique among the animal kingdom.

#### How Do Salamanders Breathe? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvIFNhbGFtYW5kZXJzIEJyZWF0aGU__7-mfq}

Different salamanders breathe in different ways. In those that have
gills, breathing occurs through the gills as water passes over the gill
slits. Sirens keep their gills all their lives, which allows them to
breathe underwater.

Species that live on land lose their gills as they grow older. These
salamanders develop lungs that are used in breathing, much like
breathing in mammals. Other land-living salamanders do not have lungs or
gills. These are called lungless salamanders. Instead, they "breathe,"
or exchange gases, through their skin. This requires blood vessels that
exchange gases to be spread throughout the skin.

#### How Big Are Salamanders? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IEJpZyBBcmUgU2FsYW1hbmRlcnM__7-e5u}

Salamanders are generally small. However, some can reach a foot or more,
as in the mudpuppy of North America. In Japan and China, the giant
salamander reaches 6 feet and weighs up to 66 pounds ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0xOS1naWFudC1zYWxhbWFuZGVy) ).

#### Classification of Salamanders {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgU2FsYW1hbmRlcnM._7-07f}

Salamanders belong to a group of approximately 500 species of
amphibians. The order Urodela, containing salamanders and newts, is
divided into three suborders:

1.  Giant salamanders, including the hellbender and Asiatic salamanders.
2.  Advanced salamanders, including lungless salamanders, mudpuppies,
    and newts. Newts are salamanders that spend most of each year living
    on land.
3.  Sirens. Sirens are salamanders that have lungs as well as gills and
    never develop beyond the larval stage.

Sirens have only two legs, but the other salamander species develop four
legs as adults, with fleshy toes at the end of each foot. The legs on
four-legged salamanders are so short that the salamander belly drags on
the ground as the animal walks. Sirens have long, strong tails that are
flat to help sirens swim like a fish, with the tail swinging from side
to side.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-x5z}

-   Salamanders live in or near water or on moist ground, often in
    a swamp.
-   Salamanders can breathe with the help of gills, lungs, or their
    skin surface.

**Frog or toad?**

Although there is actually little difference between toads and frogs,
this animal would most often be called a toad. Frogs have moist skin,
while toads have dry, bumpy skin.

### Frogs and Toads {#11.html#x-ck12-RnJvZ3MgYW5kIFRvYWRz_8-mwz}

Frogs and toads are amphibians in the order Anura. In terms of
classification, there is actually not a big difference between frogs and
toads. Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping, skin that
is smooth and moist, and special pads on their toes that help them
climb. Toads are more heavyset with shorter legs, and usually have drier
skin, often with warty-looking bumps. Frogs are more likely to live in
or near water than toads.

Frogs are found in many areas of the world, from the tropics to
subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests.
Consisting of more than 5,000 species (about 88% of amphibian species
are frogs), they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Frogs
range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to
the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon, which can weigh
up to 7 pounds. That is 1-foot from the nose to the back of the body,
not including the length of the legs. Even the largest frogs are
significantly smaller than common reptiles.

#### Characteristics of Frogs {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEZyb2dz_8-03n}

Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed
finger-like parts, and the lack of a tail. They also have a
three-chambered heart, as do all tetrapods except birds and mammals.
Most frogs live part of the time in water and part of the time on land.
They move easily on land by jumping or climbing. To become great
jumpers, frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones. They also
have a short backbone with only ten vertebrae. Frog and toad skin hangs
loosely on the body, and skin texture can be smooth, warty, or folded.

Frogs and toads don’t have fur, feathers, or scales on their skin.
Instead, they have a moist and permeable skin layer covered with mucous
glands. Their special skin allows them to breathe through their skin in
addition to using their lungs. They are vulnerable to water loss through
the skin in dry conditions, which is why they need to live near water or
in moist environments. The thin layer of mucous keeps the skin moist.

In order to live on land and in water, frogs have three eyelid
membranes: one is see-through to protect the eyes underwater, and the
two other ones let them see on land. Frogs also have a **tympanum** ,
which acts like a simple ear. They are found on each side of the head.
In some species, the tympanum is covered by skin.

#### How do Frogs Reproduce? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIEZyb2dzIFJlcHJvZHVjZT8._8-zsq}

Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds, or lakes. Their
larvae, or **tadpoles** , have gills, a tail, but no legs, and need to
live in water. If fact, they are quite similar to a fish. Tadpoles
develop into adult frogs in water ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfbWV0YW1vcnBob3Npcw..) ). During this
transformation, they develop lungs, lose their tails and form their four
legs.

You may hear males "ribbiting," producing a mating call used to attract
females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls
can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different
call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female
picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes
across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to
release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some
species, also guards them.

#### How Do Frogs Eat? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvIEZyb2dzIEVhdD8._8-6mi}

Adult frogs are meat-eaters and eat mostly insects, spiders, slugs and
worms. Larger species will eat mice, birds, and even other small
reptiles and amphibians. Frogs do not have teeth on their lower jaw, so
they usually swallow their food whole. Some frogs have teeth on the
upper jaw that are used to hold the prey in place.

Frogs and toads are responsible for keeping a large part of the world's
insect population under control. They catch these insects using their
long tongue. The frog tongue is about a third the length of the frog's
body, though they can grow even longer. They can easily reach 12 inches
long in an adult frog. Frog’s tongues are attached to the front of their
mouths rather than at the back like humans. They release a sticky
substance at the precise moment of impact with their food. When a frog
catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of it’s mouth and
wraps it around its prey. The frog’s tongue then snaps back and throws
the food down its throat. This happens about as fast as a blink of your
eyes. 

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-y75}

-   Frogs are characterized by long hind legs, webbed finger-like parts,
    a tympanum, and the lack of a tail.
-   A frog's "ribbit" is a mating call used to attract females.

**Would you eat this?**

This is a plate of frog legs! Many people would view this dish as a
tasty treat. As you can see, one way amphibians are important to people
is that they can be used as a food source.

### Role of Amphibians {#11.html#x-ck12-Um9sZSBvZiBBbXBoaWJpYW5z_9-wdx}

Humans have used amphibians for a number of purposes for thousands of
years, if not longer. Amphibians play significant roles in many food
webs and are thus an important part of many ecosystems. For example,
frogs keep insect populations stable. Extinction of frogs, or just
significant decreases in the frog population, would probably have
serious consequences for agricultural crops.

Humans have also consumed amphibians, especially frogs, probably since
they first ate meat. More recently, amphibians have been tremendously
useful in research.

#### Amphibians as Foods {#11.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFucyBhcyBGb29kcw.._9-kuf}

Amphibians play important roles in many ecosystems, especially as middle
players in many food chains and food webs. In addition to consuming many
worms and insects and other arthropods, and even some small reptiles and
mammals and fish, they are prey for turtles and snakes, as well as some
fish and birds. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae.

Frogs are raised as a food source for humans. Frog legs are a delicacy
in China, France, the Philippines, northern Greece, and the American
south, especially the Frensh-speaking parts of Louisiana. Only the upper
joint of the hind leg is served, which has a single bone similar to the
upper joint of a chicken or turkey wing. They are commonly prepared by
grilling or deep frying, sometimes breaded, though they can also be
served with garlic, or turned into a soup or stew. Some estimates have
well over a billion frogs harvested a year as food. That's about one
frog harvested for every seven people on the planet. 

#### Amphibians in Research {#11.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFucyBpbiBSZXNlYXJjaA.._9-5ki}

Amphibians have long been used in scientific research, especially
developmental and physiological processes, largely due to their unique
ability to undergo metamorphosis, and in some species, to regenerate
limbs.

Amphibians are also used in cloning research. **Cloning** involves
making identical copies of a parent organism, and the large amphibian
egg helps in this process. They are also used to study embryos because
their eggs lack shells, so it is easy to watch their development.

The African clawed frog, *Xenopus laevis* , is a species that is studied
to understand aspects of developmental biology. It is a good model
organism because it is easy to raise in a lab and has a large embryo,
which is easy to study ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZnJvZ2VtYnJ5bw..) ). Many *Xenopus*
genes have been identified and cloned, especially those involved in
development. Developing *Xenopus* embryos can be easily observed and
studied with a basic microscope, though the eggs are large enough to see
without a microscope. Because of their size, the exact developmental
stage after fertilization can be easily determined. This allows proteins
that are used at a specific developmental time to be collected and
analyzed. Identification of *Xenopus* genes and proteins has allowed the
identification of corresponding genes and proteins from humans.

Many environmental scientists believe that amphibians, including frogs,
indicate when an environment is damaged. When species of frogs begin to
decline, it often indicates that there is a bigger problem within the
ecosystem. This could have dramatic effects on food webs and ecosystems.

#### Amphibians in Popular Culture {#11.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFucyBpbiBQb3B1bGFyIEN1bHR1cmU._9-btj}

Amphibians can be found in folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture.
Numerous legends have developed over the centuries around the mystical
properties of the salamander. Its name originates from the Persian words
for “fire” and “within," so many of these legends are related to fire.
This connection likely originates from the tendency of many salamanders
to live inside rotting logs. When placed into the fire, salamanders
would escape from the logs, lending to the belief that the salamander
was created from flames.

Unforgettable amphibians Kermit the Frog ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfa2VybWl0) ) and his popular saying “It’s
not easy being green.” Frogger, from the video game of the same name,
has been teaching children about the dangers of the road and
alligator-filled moats for years. And all it takes is a kiss from a
princess to turn a frog into a prince, as told in *The Frog Prince*
story.

**What does this chameleon have in common with a snake?**

Though they are both reptiles and seem very different, chameleons and
snakes actually share several traits. For example, they both have skin
covered in scales and are cold-blooded animals. But notice the distinct
eyes and "horns" on the chameleon. Snakes don't have these. And some
chameleons have the ability to change color.

### Characteristics of Reptiles {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFJlcHRpbGVz_10-csj}

What reptiles can you name? Snakes, alligators, and crocodiles are all
reptiles. Modern reptiles live on every continent except Antarctica.
They range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero (a dwarf
gecko), at 0.6 inches, to the saltwater crocodile, at up to 23 feet.

There are four living orders of reptiles:

1.  Squamata, which includes lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenids
    (or “worm-lizards”).
2.  Crocodilia, which includes crocodiles, gharials ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yMi1yZXB0aWxlcw..) ), caimans,
    and alligators.
3.  Testudines, which includes turtles and tortoises.
4.  Sphenodontia, which includes tuatara ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yMi1yZXB0aWxlcw..) ).

#### Traits of Reptiles {#11.html#x-ck12-VHJhaXRzIG9mIFJlcHRpbGVz_10-ltk}

Reptiles are tetrapods (four-legged) and **ectothermic** , meaning their
internal temperature depends on the temperature of their environment.
This is why you may see reptiles sunbathing as they use the energy from
the sun to warm their bodies. Usually the sense organs of reptiles, like
ears, are well developed, though snakes do not have external ears. All
reptiles have advanced eyesight. Reptiles also have a sense of smell.
Crocodilians, turtles, and tortoises smell like most other land
vertebrates. But, some lizards, and all snakes, smell with their
tongues, which is flicked out of the mouth to pick up scent molecules
from the air.

Reptiles also have several adaptations for living on land. They have a
skin covered in scales to protect them from drying out. All reptiles
have lungs to breathe air. Reptiles are also **amniotes** , which means
their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane. This membrane protects
the embryo from the harsh conditions of living on land. Reptile eggs are
also surrounded by a protective shell, which may be either flexible or
inflexible.

#### How Do Reptiles Reproduce? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvIFJlcHRpbGVzIFJlcHJvZHVjZT8._10-1kn}

Most reptiles reproduce sexually, meaning there are two parents
involved. In some families of lizards and one snake family, however,
**asexual reproduction** is possible. This is when only one parent is
involved in creating new life. For example, the gecko females can make
tiny clones of themselves without the aid of a male.

All reptiles have a **cloaca** , a single exit and entrance for sperm,
eggs, and waste, located at the base of the tail. Most reptiles lay
amniotic eggs covered with leathery or hard shell. These eggs can be
placed anywhere as they don't have to be in a moist environment, like
the eggs of amphibians. However, not all species lay eggs, as certain
species of squamates can give birth to live young.

Unlike the amphibians, there are no larval stages of development. The
young reptiles look like miniature versions of the adult. The young
reptiles are generally left to fend for themselves. However, some
reptiles provide care for their young. For example, crocodiles and
alligators may defend their young from predators.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-qfh}

-   Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are surrounded
    by a thin membrane.
-   Reptiles typically reproduce sexually and lay eggs.

**Are snakes deadly?**

Some snakes are poisonous, but the majority of snakes are fairly
harmless if they are left alone. This rat snake is actually beneficial
to humans because it eats mice and rats, keeping those populations in
balance. Some related species are so tame that they are often kept as
pets.

### Lizards and Snakes {#11.html#x-ck12-TGl6YXJkcyBhbmQgU25ha2Vz_11-lxx}

Lizards and snakes belong to the largest order of reptiles, Squamata.
Lizards are a large group of reptiles, with nearly 5,000 species, living
on every continent except Antarctica. Some places are just too cold for
lizards.

#### Characteristics of Lizards and Snakes {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIExpemFyZHMgYW5kIFNuYWtlcw.._11-bvw}

Lizards and snakes are distinguished by scales or shields and movable
**quadrate bones,** which make it possible to open the upper jaw very
wide. Quadrate bones are especially visible in snakes, because they are
able to open their mouths very wide to eat large prey ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yNC1jb3JuLXNuYWtlLWVhdGluZy1tb3VzZQ..)
). Without this ability, the snake diet would be very limited.

#### Characteristics of Lizards {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIExpemFyZHM._11-ykh}

Key features of lizards include:

-   Four limbs.
-   External ears.
-   Movable eyelids.
-   A short neck.
-   A long tail, which they can shed in order to escape from predators.
-   They eat insects.

Vision, including color vision, is well-developed in lizards. You may
have seen a lizard camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings. Since
they have great vision, lizards communicate by changing the color of
their bodies. They also communicate with chemical signals called
**pheromones** .

Adult lizards range from one inch in length, like some Caribbean geckos,
to the nearly 10-foot-long Komodo dragon ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yNS1rb21vZG8.) ).

</div>

With 40 lizard families, there is an extremely wide range of color,
appearance, and size of lizards. Many lizards are capable of
regenerating lost limbs or tails. Almost all lizards are **carnivorous**
, meaning they eat animals, although most are so small that insects are
their primary prey. However, some have reached sizes where they can prey
on birds and mammals. On the other hand, a few species of lizards
exclusively eat plants.

#### Lizard Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-TGl6YXJkIEJlaGF2aW9y_11-o8c}

Have you ever tried catching a lizard? Many lizards are good climbers or
fast sprinters. Some can run on two feet, such as the collared lizard.
Some, like the basilisk, can even run across the surface of water to
escape danger. Many lizards can change color in response to their
environments or in times of stress ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yNi1saXphcmQtY2Ftbw..) ). The most
familiar example is the chameleon, but more subtle color changes can
occur in other lizard species.

#### Legless Lizards {#11.html#x-ck12-TGVnbGVzcyBMaXphcmRz_11-jgt}

Some lizard species, including the glass lizard and flap-footed lizards,
have evolved to lose their legs, or their legs are so small that they no
longer work. This provides these species an evolutionary advantage in
their way of life. Legless lizards almost look like snakes, though
structures leftover from earlier stages of evolution remain. For
example, flap-footed lizards can be distinguished from snakes by their
external ears.

#### Characteristics of Snakes {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFNuYWtlcw.._11-z1q}

Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do not have
eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs. The more than 2,700 species
of snake can be found on every continent except Antarctica and range in
size from the tiny, 4-inch-long thread snake to pythons, to the over
17-foot-long anaconda ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yNy1hbmFjb25kYQ..) ).

In order to fit inside of snakes’ narrow bodies, paired organs, such as
kidneys, appear one in front of the other instead of side by side.
Snakes’ eyelids are transparent “spectacle” scales which remain
permanently closed. Most snakes are not venomous, but some have venom
capable of causing painful injury or death to humans. However, snake
venom is primarily used for killing prey rather than for self-defense.
Snakes that are kept as pets can have their venom removed without
affecting the health of the snake.

Most snakes use specialized belly scales, which grip surfaces to move (
**Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yOC1iYW5kZWQta3JhaXQtc2NhbGVz) ). In
the shedding of scales, known as **molting** , the complete outer layer
of skin is shed in one layer ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0yOS1zbmFrZS1zaGVkZGluZw..) ). Molting
replaces old and worn skin, allows the snake to grow, and helps it get
rid of parasites such as mites and ticks.

Although different snake species reproduce in different ways, all snakes
use **internal fertilization,** where fertilization of the egg takes
place inside the female. The male uses sex organs stored in its tail to
transfer sperm to the female. Most species of snakes lay eggs, and most
species abandon these eggs shortly after laying them.

#### How do Snakes Eat? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIFNuYWtlcyBFYXQ__11-vwg}

All snakes are strictly carnivorous, eating small animals including
lizards, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails, or
insects. Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, prey
must be swallowed whole. Therefore, the body size of a snake has a major
influence on its eating habits. A snake can usually estimate in advance
if a prey is too large. 

The snake’s jaw is unique in the animal kingdom. Snakes have a very
flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached.
They also have many other joints in their skull, allowing them to open
their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole.

Some snakes have a venomous bite, which they use to kill their prey
before eating it. Other snakes kill their prey by strangling them, and
still others swallow their prey whole and alive. After eating, snakes
enter a resting stage, while the process of digestion takes place. The
process is highly efficient, with the snake’s digestive enzymes
dissolving and absorbing everything but the prey’s hair and claws! 

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-ats}

-   Snakes and lizards are both in the order Squamata, distinguished by
    horny scales or shields and movable quadrate bones, which make it
    possible to open the upper jaw very wide.
-   Snakes are different from legless lizards because they do NOT have
    eyelids, limbs, external ears, or forelimbs.

**Crocodile or Alligator?**

This picture is a crocodile, identified by it's V-shaped snout.
Alligators have more of a U-shaped snout. Although crocodiles and
alligators have a few differences, they are very much alike and belong
to the same order, Crocodilia.

### Alligators and Crocodiles {#11.html#x-ck12-QWxsaWdhdG9ycyBhbmQgQ3JvY29kaWxlcw.._12-4qa}

Crocodilia, containing both alligators and crocodiles, is an order of
large reptiles. Reptiles belonging to Crocodilia are the closest living
relatives of birds. Reptiles and birds are the only known living
descendants of the dinosaurs. Some would day that alligators and
crocodiles actually look like small dinosaurs. Dinosaurs that evolved
wings are the ancestors of birds.

The basic crocodilian body plan ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0zMC1uaWxlLWNyb2Nz) ) is a very
successful one and has changed little over time. Modern species actually
look very similar to their Cretaceous ancestors of 84 million years ago.
All species of crocodilians have similar body structures, including an
elongated snout, powerful jaws, muscular tail, large protective scales,
streamlined body, and eyes and nostrils that are positioned on top of
the head.

#### Characteristics of Crocodiles {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIENyb2NvZGlsZXM._12-i3b}

Crocodilians have a flexible, semi-erect posture. They can walk either
in a low, sprawled “belly walk,” or hold their legs more directly
underneath them to perform the “high walk.” Most other reptiles can only
walk in a sprawled position.

All crocodilians have, like humans, teeth set in bony sockets. But
unlike mammals, they replace their teeth throughout life. Crocodiles and
gharials (large crocodilians with longer jaws) have salivary glands on
their tongue, which are used to remove salt from their bodies. This
helps with life in a saltwater environment. Crocodilians are often seen
lying with their mouths open, a behavior called **gaping** . One of its
functions is probably to cool them down.

The crocodilian digestive system is highly adapted to their lifestyle.
Crocodilians are known to swallow stones, known as **gastroliths** ,
which help digest their prey. The crocodilian stomach is divided into
two chambers. The first is powerful and muscular. The other stomach is
the most acidic digestive system of any animal. It can digest mostly
everything from their prey, including bones, feathers, and horns!

All crocodilians are carnivores. They feed on live animals such as
birds, small mammals and fish. Crocodilians use several methods of
attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush. The
crocodilian lies motionless beneath the water's surface with only their
nostrils above the water line. This keeps them concealed while they
watch for prey that approaches the water's edge. The crocodilian then
lunges out of the water, taking their prey by surprise and dragging it
from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed.

The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of
the eggs during **incubation,** when eggs are kept warm before they
hatch. This means that the sex of crocodilians is not determined
genetically. If the eggs are kept at a cold or a hot temperature, then
their offspring may be all male or all female. To get both male and
female offspring, the temperature must be kept within a narrow range.

Female crocodilians care for the young after they hatch, providing them
with protection until they grow large enough to defend themselves. In
many species of crocodilians, the female carries her tiny offspring in
her mouth.

#### Evolving More Complex Structures {#11.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHZpbmcgTW9yZSBDb21wbGV4IFN0cnVjdHVyZXM._12-aue}

Like all reptiles, crocodilians have a relatively small brain, but the
crocodilian brain is more advanced than those of other reptiles. Because
of their aquatic habitat, the eyes, ears, and nostrils are all located
on the same "face" in a line one after the other.

The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs. They see well during the
day and may even have color vision, and they also have excellent night
vision. A third transparent eyelid, the **nictitating membrane** ,
protects their eyes underwater. The eardrums are located behind the eyes
and are covered by a movable flap of skin. This flap closes, along with
the nostrils and eyes, when they dive. This prevents water from entering
their external head openings. Their jaws are covered with **sensory
pits** , which hold bundles of nerve fibers that respond to the
slightest disturbance in surface water. Crocodiles can detect vibrations
and small pressure changes in water. This makes it possible for them to
sense prey and danger even in total darkness, and becomes very useful
when the animal is submerged in the water.

Like mammals and birds, and unlike other reptiles, crocodiles have a
four-chambered heart. But, unlike mammals, blood with and without oxygen
can be mixed.

-   Crocodilians swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which help digest
    their prey.
-   The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature
    of the eggs during incubation.

**What are these?**

This picture might look like a bunch of ping-pong balls, but actually
it's a picture of turtle eggs. Notice the soft, leathery shell that is
typical of reptile eggs.

### Turtles {#11.html#x-ck12-VHVydGxlcw.._13-mi3}

Turtles are reptiles in the order Testudines. If you have seen turtles
before, what is the most noticeable thing about them? Their shells. Most
turtle bodies are covered by a special shell developed from their ribs.
Their shells can be bony or **cartilaginous** , made from a more
flexible supportive tissue. About 300 species are alive today, and some
are highly endangered. Like other reptiles, turtles cannot regulate
their body temperature, except with behavioral means, such as burrowing
underground. The major difference between turtles and tortoises is that
the land dwelling ones are called tortoises and water dwelling are
called turtles.

Turtles are broken down into two groups, based on how they bring their
neck back into their shell:

1.  Cryptodira, which can draw their neck inside and under their spine.
2.  Pleurodira, which fold their necks to one side.

#### Characteristics of Turtles {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFR1cnRsZXM._13-1qo}

Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater,
they can also spend much of their lives on dry land and breathe air.
Turtles cannot breathe in water, but can hold their breath for long
periods of time. Turtles must surface at regular intervals to refill
their lungs.

The position of a turtle's eyes can give a clue to their natural
habitat. Most turtles that spend most of their lives on land have their
eyes looking down at objects in front of them. Some aquatic turtles,
such as snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles, have eyes closer to
the top of the head. These species of turtles can hide from predators in
shallow water, where they lie entirely submerged in water except for
their eyes and nostrils.

Sea turtles ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0zMi1zZWEtdHVydGxl) ) have glands near
their eyes that produce salty tears, which remove excess salt taken in
from the water they drink.

**Figure 11.28**

flippers.

</div>

Turtles have exceptional night vision due to the unusually large number
of cells that sense light in their eyes. This allows them to be active
at any time of the day. Turtles also have color vision.

Turtles don’t lay eggs underwater. Turtles lay slightly soft and
leathery eggs, like other reptiles. The eggs of the largest species are
spherical, while the eggs of the rest are longer in shape. After
internal fertilization, a female is ready to lay her eggs, she places a
large numbers of eggs in holes dug into mud or sand. They are then
covered and left to grow and develop by themselves. When the turtles
hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water.
They need to get to the water as fast as possible before they are fed
upon by animals such as seabirds, crabs, and raccoons.

#### How do Turtles Eat? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IGRvIFR1cnRsZXMgRWF0Pw.._13-qau}

Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but
in the water is another story. Turtles can be either herbivores or
carnivores, with most sea turtles **carnivorous** . Turtles have a rigid
beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the
upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges.
Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges
for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast
animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does
have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges
and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with
stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea
turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated
ridges that help them cut through tough plants.

#### How Big Are Turtles? {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IEJpZyBBcmUgVHVydGxlcz8._13-vq9}

The largest turtle is the great leatherback sea turtle ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0zMy1sZWF0aGVyYmFjay10dXJ0bGU.) ),
which can have a shell length of seven feet and can weigh more than
2,000 pounds. The only surviving giant tortoises are on the Seychelles
and Galápagos Islands and can grow to over four feet in length and weigh
about 670 pounds ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0zNC1naWFudC10b3J0b2lzZQ..) ). The
smallest turtle is the speckled padloper tortoise of South Africa,
measuring no more than three inches in length, and weighing about five
ounces. The largest ever turtle was the know extinct *Archelon* genus, a
Late Cretaceous sea turtle known to have been up to 15 ft long, and 16
ft wide from flipper to flipper. The closest living relative of this
genus is the leatherback sea turtle.

It was the giant Galápagos tortoises that Charles Darwin studied during
his voyage on the *Beagle,* providing significant evidence that he used
to support his theory of evolution.

**What good are reptiles?**

There is a lot of fear surrounding snakes and other reptiles. What you
might not realize is that reptiles do a lot of good. For example, snakes
eat rats and other small animals. Rats can carry diseases to people, so
keeping their population under control is very important.

### Importance of Reptiles {#11.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBSZXB0aWxlcw.._14-eai}

Reptiles play an important role in the life of humans. In addition to
playing an important role in many food chains, which keep the
populations of small animals under control, reptiles serve as food,
pets, and have played roles in art and culture for thousands of years.

#### Reptiles as Food {#11.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZXMgYXMgRm9vZA.._14-pta}

Reptiles are important as food sources for people:

-   Green **iguanas** , a type of large lizard, are eaten in
    Central America.
-   The tribals of Irulas from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India
    are known to eat some of the snakes they catch.
-   Cantonese snake soup is consumed by local people in the fall to
    prevent colds. The soup is believed to warm up their body of those
    who eat it.
-   Cooked rattlesnake meat is commonly consumed in parts of the
    Midwestern United States. You can eat rattlesnake meat without worry
    of the poisonous venom. Other snake meat is consumed throughout
    the world.
-   Turtle soup is consumed throughout the world.

#### Reptiles as Pets {#11.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZXMgYXMgUGV0cw.._14-exa}

Reptiles also make good pets. In the Western world, some snakes,
especially less aggressive species, like the ball python or corn snake,
are kept as pets. Turtles, particularly small land-dwelling and
freshwater turtles, are also common pets. Among the most popular are
Russian tortoises, Greek spur-thighed tortoises, and terrapins. Large
constrictor snakes like pythons, boa constrictors, and anacondas are
powerful wild animals capable of killing an adult human, and they are
commonly kept as pets. Many people don't think this is a wise idea, as
these reptiles pose dangerous threats to people, especially children.

Reptiles are capable of recognizing people by voice, sight and smell;
many are capable of learning. Some species actually benefit from
interaction with humans. When cared for properly, all live as long or
longer than mammalian pets of similar size. Having a reptile as a pet,
you get to learn about everything from adaptation, behavior and the
environment, to nutrition, camouflage and reproductive strategies.
Learning about the natural history and proper captive care of these
animals just might change your world outlook and get you thinking more
about the environment as a whole.

Keep in mind that if you want to have a snake as a pet, that there are
no herbivorous snakes, and you must be willing to feed it a proper diet.
Be prepared to feed your snake, or other reptile, mice, rats, birds'
eggs, insects, or fish. And these need to be served raw. Of course, the
herbivorous reptiles, such as the green iguanas and some tortoises, are
much easier to feed. They eat foods such as chopped collard greens,
romaine lettuce, chopped squash and bananas.

#### Reptiles in Art and Culture {#11.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZXMgaW4gQXJ0IGFuZCBDdWx0dXJl_14-djy}

Finally, reptiles play a significant role in folklore, religion, and
popular culture. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped reptiles
and often put lizards in their art. Snakes or serpents are connected to
healing and to the Devil. Since snakes shed and then heal again, they
are a symbol of healing and medicine, as shown in the **Rod of
Asclepius** ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xMy0zNS1Sb2Qtb2YtQXNjbGVwaXVz) ). In
Egyptian history, the Nile cobra is found on the crown of the pharaoh.
This snake was worshiped as one of the gods.

Reptiles have also played roles in more recent popular culture.
Unforgettable reptiles include Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, and
Raphael, otherwise known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and
Godzilla, one of the most famous movie reptiles who has been terrorizing
Japanese cities for years. Dino, from *The Flintstones* is one of the
more lovable television reptiles. On the other hand is Nagini from the
*Harry Potter* series. This tremendously long snake (roughly 12 feet) is
difficult to forget as she was very important to Lord Voldemort. Though
her appearances are far and few between, her unwavering loyalty to the
Dark Lord makes her one of the more infamous reptiles.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-pwe}

-   Reptiles are eaten as food and kept as pets.
-   Reptiles have served as symbols in folklore, religion, and
    popular culture.

**Can all birds fly?**

No, not all birds can fly. And not all birds have wings. This penguin is
a good example. Their wings have evolved into flippers, adapted for
swimming instead of flying. The kiwi of New Zealand is another bird
without wings.

### Characteristics of Birds {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEJpcmRz_15-2rx}

How many different types of birds can you think of? Robins, ostriches,
hummingbirds, chickens, and eagles. All of these are birds, but they are
very different from one another. There is an amazingly wide variety of
birds. Like amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and fish, birds are
**vertebrates** . What does that mean? It means they have a backbone.
Almost all birds have forelimbs modified as wings, but not all birds can
fly. In some birds, the wings have evolved into other structures.

Birds are in the class Aves. All birds have the following key features:
they are **endothermic** (warm-blooded), have two legs, and lay eggs.

Birds range in size from the tiny two-inch bee hummingbird to the
nine-foot ostrich ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wMS1vc3RyaWNo) ). With approximately
10,000 living species, birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four
limbs. They live in diverse habitats around the globe, from the Arctic
to the Antarctic.

#### Features of Birds {#11.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgQmlyZHM._15-ldh}

The digestive system of birds is unique, with a **gizzard** that
contains swallowed stones for grinding food. Birds do not have teeth.
What do you think the stones do? They help them digest their food.
Defining characteristics of modern birds also include:

-   Feathers.
-   High metabolism.
-   A four-chambered heart.
-   A beak with no teeth.
-   A lightweight but strong skeleton.
-   Production of hard-shelled eggs.

Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to flight?

#### Adaptations for Flight {#11.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnMgZm9yIEZsaWdodA.._15-vq1}

In comparing birds with other vertebrates, what do you think
distinguishes them the most? In most birds, flight is the obvious
difference. Birds have adapted their body plan for flight:

-   Their skeleton is especially lightweight, with large, air-filled
    spaces connecting to their respiratory system.
-   Their neck bones are flexible. Birds that fly have a bony ridge
    along the breastbone that the flight muscles attach to ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wMi1LZWVsLWJvbmU.) ). This allows
    them to remain stable in the air as they fly.
-   Birds also have wings that function as an **aerofoil** . The surface
    of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control and use the air
    currents to fly. Aerofoils are also found on the wings of airplanes.

**Figure 11.33**

as they fly.

</div>

What other traits do you think might be important for flight? Feathers
help because they're more lightweight than scales or fur. A bird’s wing
shape and size will determine how a species flies. For example, many
birds have powered flight at certain times, requiring the flapping of
their wings, while at other times they soar, using up less energy (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wMy10ZXJuLWZsaWdodA..) ).

About 60 living bird species are flightless, such as penguins, as were
many extinct birds. Flightlessness often evolves when birds live on
isolated islands. The absence of land predators might make flying no
longer necessary. Other birds evolved into new niches where flying was
no longer necessary. This may have been in response to limited
resources. For example, the flightless cormorant can no longer fly, but
its wings are now adapted to swim in the sea ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wNC1GbGlnaHRsZXNzLWNvcm1vcmFudA..) ).

**Why do peacocks have huge, bright feathers?**

Male peacocks use their colorful feathers to attract females. Females
tend to mate with the males with the largest, brightest feathers. A
large, bright tail indicates the male is healthy and likely to produce
healthy offspring. You've probably also heard birds "sing." Eagles do
aerial acrobatics and tumbling. These are other ways to attract mates.

### Reproduction in Birds {#11.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGluIEJpcmRz_16-ni0}

How do birds reproduce? We know that chickens lay eggs. But how do they
do that?

It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate. In birds, this
will involve a type of display, usually performed by the male. Some
displays are very elaborate and may include dancing, aerial flights, or
wing or tail drumming. Most male birds also sing a type of song to
attract females. If they are successful at attracting a female, it will
lead to breeding.

Birds reproduce by **internal fertilization** , during which the egg is
fertilized inside the female. Like reptiles, birds have **cloaca** , or
a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste. The male brings
his sperm to the female cloaca. The sperm fertilizes the egg. Then the
hard-shelled egg develops within the female. The hard-shelled eggs have
a fluid-filled **amnion** , a thin membrane forming a closed sac around
the embryo. Eggs are usually laid in a nest.

#### Protecting Offspring {#11.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVjdGluZyBPZmZzcHJpbmc._16-9cx}

Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors? Birds that make
nests in the open have camouflaged eggs ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wNS1jYW1vLWVnZ3M.) ). This gives the
eggs protection against predation. Some species, like ground-nesting
nightjars, have pale eggs, but the birds camouflage the eggs with their
feathers.

To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests.
Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to ostriches, make nests. Many can
be elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows.
However, some birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests.
Instead, they lay their eggs on bare cliffs. Emperor penguins do not
have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they
hatch, a process called **incubation** .

How else might a bird help protect its young from predators? Most
species locate their nests in areas that are hidden, in order to avoid
predators. Large birds, or those that nest in groups, may build nests in
the open, since they are more capable of defending their young.

#### Parental Care {#11.html#x-ck12-UGFyZW50YWwgQ2FyZQ.._16-ho4}

In birds, 90% to 95% of species are **monogamous** , meaning the male
and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one
mate dies. Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are
monogamous. Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs. Birds
usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid. In
**polygamous** species, where there is more than one mate, one parent
does all of the incubating. The wild turkey is an example of a
polygamous bird.

The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different
species of birds. At one extreme, in a group of birds called the
magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at
hatching. In this case, the newly-hatched chick digs itself out of the
nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away.
These birds are called **precocial** . Other precocial birds include the
domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese. At the other
extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of
time. For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive
parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then
take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wNi1ncmVhdC1mcmlnYXRlYmlyZA..) ).
These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called
**altricial** .

In most animals, male parental care is rare. But it is very common in
birds. Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and
nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks. Since birds often take
great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called
**brood parasitism.** This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in
another bird’s nest. The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite
bird's eggs.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-qzw}

-   Birds often use flashy displays to attract mates.
-   Breeding in birds is through internal fertilization, where the egg
    is fertilized inside the female.
-   Birds generally are monogamous, and both parents help to care for
    the young.

**How are birds different?**

Not all birds look the same. They are obviously different in many ways.
They come in all colors and sizes. They live in a variety of habitats.
They eat a variety of foods.

### Diversity of Birds {#11.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJzaXR5IG9mIEJpcmRz_17-ev8}

Turkey, hummingbird, penguin, parrot, owl and eagle. These are just some
of the many different types of birds. If you just think about the birds
in this list, the differences are striking. About 10,000 bird species
belong to 29 different orders within the class Aves. They live and breed
on all seven continents. The tropics are home to the greatest
biodiversity of birds. The diversity among birds is striking. Birds can
vary greatly in size and color. Some fly, some swim, some just walk or
run. Some are savage carnivores, others are gentle herbivores. Some are
low on the food chain, others are at the top.

Birds live in a variety of different habitats. Birds that live in
different habitats will encounter different foods and different
predators. Birds can be **carnivores** (feeding on other animals),
**herbivores** (feeding on plants), or **generalists** (feeding on a
variety of foods). The lifestyle of the bird can affect what it looks
like. For example, can you think of some examples of beaks that are
adapted to the type of food a bird eats? Carnivorous birds include
hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, vultures and owls. Herbivorous birds
include the goose, cockatoo and parrot. The American Crow is an example
of a generalist. In addition, a specialist is a bird (or other animal)
that is specially adapted to eat a certain food. An example of a
specialist is a hummingbird, whose long, thin beak is excellent for
reaching into flowers for nectar, but not very good for eating other
foods.

Waterfowl are birds that live on the water. These include ducks, geese,
swans, and pelicans, to name a few. Landfowl are ground-feeding birds
such as chickens and turkeys. Penguins are a group of flightless birds
adapted for life in the water with flippers. Diurnal raptors are birds
of prey that hunt during the day. These include falcons, eagles and
hawks. Nocturnal raptors hunt during the night. These include various
types of owls. Parrots are brightly colored and very intelligent. They
are found in the tropics and include cockatoos, parrots, and parakeets.

#### Beaks {#11.html#x-ck12-QmVha3M._17-lbf}

The size and shape of the beak is related to the food the bird eats and
can vary greatly among different birds. Parrots have down-curved, hooked
bills, which are well-adapted for cracking seeds and nuts ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wNy1iZWFrLWNvbXBhcmlzb24.) ).
Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have long, thin, pointed bills, which
are adapted for getting the nectar out of flowers ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wNy1iZWFrLWNvbXBhcmlzb24.) ). Hawks,
eagles, falcons and owls have a sharp, hooked beak.

</div>

#### Feet {#11.html#x-ck12-RmVldA.._17-2tt}

Bird feet can also vary greatly among different birds. Some birds, such
as gulls and terns and other waterfowl, have webbed feet used for
swimming or floating ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wOS1mb290LWNvbXBhcmlzb24.) ). Other
birds, such as herons, gallinules, and rails, have four long spreading
toes, which are adapted for walking delicately in the wetlands (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wOS1mb290LWNvbXBhcmlzb24.)
). You can predict how the beaks and feet of birds will look depending
on where they live and what type of food they eat. Flightless birds also
have long legs that are adapted for running. Flightless birds include
the ostrich and kiwi.

Raptors have clawed feet. They also have strong legs. Hawks, eagles and
falcons also have excellent vision and they hunt by sight. Owls, with
excellent hearing, can hunt by that sense alone.

**Do you eat birds?**

If you've eaten a turkey or a chicken nugget, then you've eaten a bird!
Providing a food source is just one way that birds are important to
humans. In the United States, more than 230 million turkeys are consumed
each year, with almost 50 million of those turkeys being eaten at
Thanksgiving.

### Importance of Birds {#11.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBCaXJkcw.._18-uik}

You are probably familiar with birds as food. People have always hunted
birds for food. People eventually discovered that certain wild fowl
(ducks, chickens, turkeys) could be tamed. This discovery led to the
development of poultry, which is domesticated fowl that farmers raise
for meat and eggs. Chickens are probably the oldest kinds of poultry.
Chickens were domesticated in Asia at least 3,000 years ago. Since then,
farmers have developed other poultry, including ducks, geese,
guineafowl, pheasants, and turkeys. Around the world, people consume all
these birds, and even more exotic birds, like ostriches. Today, chickens
rank as the most widely raised poultry by far. Farmers throughout the
world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and
eggs. Ducks and turkeys rank second and third in production worldwide.
Ducks are raised for both meat and eggs. Turkeys are raised mainly for
meat.

Can you think of other ways that birds are important?

#### Birds and Humans {#11.html#x-ck12-QmlyZHMgYW5kIEh1bWFucw.._18-pls}

1.  In agriculture, humans harvest bird droppings for use as fertilizer.
    These droppings have a high content of nitrogen, phosphate, and
    potassium, three nutrients essential for plant growth.
2.  Chickens are also used as an early warning system of human diseases,
    such as West Nile virus. Mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus, bite
    young chickens and other birds, and infect them with the virus. When
    chickens or other birds become infected, humans may also become
    infected in the near future.
3.  Birds have important cultural relationships with humans. Birds are
    common pets in the Western world. Common bird pets include canaries,
    parrots, finches, and parakeets. Sometimes, people act cooperatively
    with birds. For example, the Borana people in Africa use birds to
    guide them to honey that they use in food.
4.  Birds also play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion,
    and popular culture. They have been featured in art since
    prehistoric times, when they appeared in early cave paintings. Many
    young child know of Big Bird, a very large canary of *Sesame
    Street* fame.
5.  Feathers are also used all over the world to stuff pillows,
    mattresses, sleeping bags, coats, and quilting. Goose feathers are
    preferred because they are soft. Manufacturers often mix goose
    feathers with down feathers to provide extra softness.

#### Birds and the Ecosystem {#11.html#x-ck12-QmlyZHMgYW5kIHRoZSBFY29zeXN0ZW0._18-qm3}

Birds are obviously important members of many ecosystems. They are
integral parts of food chains and food webs. In a woodland ecosystem for
example, some birds get their food mainly from plants. Others chiefly
eat small animals, such as insects or earthworms. Birds and bird eggs,
in turn, serve as food for such animals as foxes, raccoons, and snakes.
The feeding relationships among all the animals in an ecosystem help
prevent any one species from becoming too numerous. Birds play a vital
role in keeping this balance of nature. In addition to being important
parts of food webs, birds play other roles within ecosystems.

1.  Birds eat insects. They are a natural way to control pests in
    gardens, on farms, and other places. A group of birds gliding
    through the air can easily eat hundreds of insects each day. Insect
    eating birds include warblers, bluebirds and woodpeckers.
2.  Nectar-feeding birds are important **pollinators** , meaning they
    move the pollen from flower to flower to help fertilize the sex
    cells and create new plants. Hummingbirds, sunbirds, and the
    honey-eaters are common pollinators.
3.  Many fruit-eating birds help disperse seeds. After eating fruit,
    they carry the seeds in their intestines and deposit them in
    new places. Fruit-eating birds include mockingbirds, orioles,
    finches and robins.
4.  Birds are often important to island ecology. In New Zealand, the
    kereru and kokako are important browsers, or animals that eat or
    nibble on leaves, tender young shoots, or other vegetation (
    **Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xMS1icm93c2Vycw..) ).
    Seabirds add nutrients to soil and to water with their production of
    **guano** , their dung.

**What do you have in common with a bat?**

Both humans and bats have body hair, and both humans and bats can nurse
their young. These are both characteristics of mammals, the class that
both bats and humans belong to.

### Characteristics of Mammals {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIE1hbW1hbHM._19-hlz}

What is a mammal? These animals range from bats, cats, and rats to dogs,
monkeys, elephants, and whales. They walk, run, swim, and fly. They live
in the ocean, fly in the sky, walk on the prairies, and run in the
savanna. There is a tremendous amount of diversity within the group in
terms of reproduction, habitat, and adaptation for living in those
different habitats.

What allows them to live in such diverse environments? They have evolved
specialized traits, unlike those of any other group of animal. Mammals
(class Mammalia) are **endothermic** (warm-blooded) vertebrate animals
with a number of unique characteristics. In most mammals, these include:

-   The presence of hair or fur.
-   Sweat glands.
-   Glands specialized to produce milk, known as **mammary glands** .
-   Three middle ear bones.
-   A **neocortex** region in the brain, which specializes in seeing
    and hearing.
-   Specialized teeth.
-   A four-chambered heart.

There are approximately 5,400 mammalian species, ranging in size from
the tiny 1-2 inch bumblebee bat to the 108-foot blue whale. These are
distributed in 29 orders, 153 families, and about 1,200 genera.

There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of
reproduction. All mammals, except for a few, are **viviparous** ,
meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs. The
**monotremes** , however, have birdlike and reptilian characteristics,
such as laying eggs and a cloaca. An example of a monotreme is the
platypus with its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics. The
echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals. A second type of mammal,
the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums.
These mammals give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb
from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mother's body,
where it feeds and continues to grow. The remainder of mammals, which is
the majority of mammals, are placental mammals. These mammals develop in
the mother's uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta. Placental
mammals include humans, rabbits, squirrels, whales, elephants, shrews,
and armadillos. Dogs and cats, and sheep, cattle and horses are also
placental mammals.

Mammals are also the only animal group that evolved to live on land and
then back to live in the ocean. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have all
adapted from land-dwelling creatures to a life of swimming and
reproducing in the water ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xMy1Eb2xwaGlucw..) ). Whales have
evolved into the largest mammals.

**Do mammals lay eggs?**

Could a rabbit really lay eggs? Rabbits are mammals, and most mammals do
not lay eggs. Mammals usually give birth to live offspring. But there
are some mammals that do lay eggs.

### Mammal Reproduction {#11.html#x-ck12-TWFtbWFsIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._20-k6j}

You probably realize that cats, dogs, people, and other mammals don't
typically lay eggs. There are exceptions, however. Egg-laying is
possible among the **monotremes,** mammals with birdlike and reptilian
characteristics. Recall that mammals can be classified into three
general groups, based on their reproductive strategy: the monotremes,
the marsupials and the placental mammals.

The egg-laying monotremes, such as echidnas ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xNC1tb25vdHJlbWVz) ) and platypuses (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xNC1tb25vdHJlbWVz) ), use
one opening, the **cloaca** , to urinate, release waste, and reproduce,
just like birds. They lay leathery eggs, similar to those of lizards,
turtles, and crocodilians. Monotremes feed their young by “sweating”
milk from patches on their bellies, as they lack the nipples present on
other mammals.

eggs](ck12_11_files/20150911113531785351.jpeg "A Echidna and Platypus are both mammals, but lay eggs")

**Figure 11.42**

The echidna ( *right* ) is a member of the monotremes, the most
primitive order of mammals. Another monotreme, the platypus ( *left* ),
like other mammals in this order, lays eggs and has a single opening for
the urinary, genital, and digestive organs.

</div>

All other mammals give birth to live young and belong to one of two
different categories, the marsupials and the placental mammals. A
**marsupial** is an animal in which the embryo, which is often called a
joey, is born at an immature stage. Development must be completed
outside the mother's body. Most female marsupials have an abdominal
pouch or skin fold where there are mammary glands. The pouch is a place
for completing the development of the baby. Although blind, without fur,
and with only partially formed hind legs, the tiny newborns have well
developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into
their mother's pouch where they drink their mother's milk and continue
their development. Marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums.
Other marsupials are the wallaby and the Tasmanian Devil. Most
marsupials live in Australia and nearby areas. ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xNi1rYW5nYXJvby1hbmQtam9leQ..) ).

The majority of mammals are **placental** mammals. These are mammals in
which the developing baby is fed through the mother's placenta. Female
placental mammals develop a **placenta** after fertilization. A placenta
is a spongy structure that passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful
substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide
and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta allows the
fetus to grow for a long time within the mother.

</div>

Some mammals are alone until a female can become pregnant. Others form
social groups with big differences between sexes, such as size
differences, a trait called **sexual dimorphism** . Dominant males are
those that are the largest or best-armed. These males usually have an
advantage in mating. They may also keep other males from mating with
females within a group. This is seen in elephant seals ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xNy1oYXJlbS1zZWFscw..) ), and also
with elk, lions and non-human primates, including the orangutans and
gorillas. Male elk grow antlers, while female elk do not have antlers.
Adult male lions are not only larger than females, they have a mane of
long hair on the side of the face and top of the head.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-pxo}

-   Monotremes can lay eggs, but most mammals give birth to live young.
-   Mammals can be marsupial, where the embryo is born at an immature
    stage and develops in the pouch.
-   Mammals can be placental, where substances are passed from the
    mother to the fetus so that it can stay longer in the womb.

**To what group do rats belong?**

Rats are mammals, but this class can be divided into more specific
groups. Rats are in a group known as rodents. Rodents are gnawing
animals that include beavers, mice, and squirrels.

### Groups of Mammals {#11.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXBzIG9mIE1hbW1hbHM._21-3v8}

Traditionally, mammals were divided into groups based on their
characteristics. Scientists took into consideration their **anatomy**
(body structure), their habitats, and their feeding habits. Mammals are
divided into three subclasses and about 26 orders. Some of the groups of
mammals include:

1.  **Lagomorphs** include hares and rabbits. Rabbits and hares
    characteristically have long ears, a short tail, and strong hind
    limbs that provide for a bouncing method of locomotion. They are all
    are small to medium-sized terrestrial herbivores.
2.  **Rodents** include rats, mice, and other small gnawing mammals.
    They have a single pair of continuously growing incisors (teeth) in
    each of the upper and lower jaws that must be kept short by gnawing.
3.  **Carnivores** include cats and lions and tigers, dogs and wolves,
    polar bears, and other meat eaters.
4.  **Insectivores** include moles and shrews ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0xOS1zaHJldw..) ). These mammals
    eat primarily insects, other arthropods, and earthworms.

**Figure 11.45**

One of the subgroups of mammals is the insectivores, including this
shrew.

</div>

5.  **Bats** include the vampire bat. These mammals have forelimbs that
    form webbed wings, making bats the only mammals naturally capable of
    true and sustained flight.
6.  **Primates** include monkeys, apes and humans. These mammals are
    characterized by detailed development of the hands and feet, a
    shortened snout, and a large brain.
7.  **Ungulates** include hoofed animals, such as deer, sheep, goats,
    pigs, buffalo, elephants and giraffes ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yMC1naXJhZmZl) ). These mammals
    use their hoofs to sustain their whole body weight while moving.
    Hoofs are formed by a thick nail rolled around the tip of the toe.

The ungulates (hoofed animals), like the giraffe here, is one of the
subgroups of mammals.

</div>

Mammals can also be grouped according to the adaptations they form to
live in a certain habitat. For example, terrestrial mammals with leaping
kinds of movement, as in some marsupials and lagomorphs, typically live
in open habitats. Other terrestrial mammals are adapted for running,
such as dogs or horses. Still others, such as elephants, hippopotamuses,
and rhinoceroses, move slowly. Other mammals are adapted for living in
trees, such as many monkeys ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yMS1Ib3dsZXItbW9ua2V5) ). Others live
in water, such as manatees, whales, dolphins, and seals. Still others
are adapted for flight, like bats.

**How are mammals helpful?**

An example of a helpful mammal is a service dog. Like many dogs, service
dogs can pick up or retrieve objects for their owners. They can also
perform many other tasks for a disabled person, depending on the type of
disability.

### Importance of Mammals {#11.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBNYW1tYWxz_22-dwy}

Mammals play many important roles in ecosystems, and they also benefit
people.

#### Importance to Ecosystems {#11.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSB0byBFY29zeXN0ZW1z_22-thw}

Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every
ecosystem. Mammals are important members of food chains and food webs,
as grazers and predators. Mammals can feed at various levels of food
chains, as herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and omnivores.

Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic
relationships. For example, bats have established mutually beneficial
relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat
from each flower, and, in return, they **pollinate** the flowers. That
means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the
plant to reproduce. Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials,
primates, and rodents. In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat
their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the
animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is
transferred to that flower.

Fruit-eating bats ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yMi1mcnVpdC1iYXQ.) ) also receive
food from plants. In return, they help these plants spread their seeds.
When bats consume fruit, they also consume the seeds within the fruit.
Then they carry the seeds in their guts to far-away locations.

Zebras have been known to befriend ostriches. In this symbiotic
relationship, both species benefit. The ostrich, with its terrible
senses of smell and hearing and the zebra with its poor eyesight, are
both able to warn the other when danger is near. The zebra can smell or
hear certain dangers approaching, while the ostrich can see other
dangers. Both are prepared to warn one another at a moment’s notice so
they can each flee when necessary.

Baboons and impala have a similar relationship. Impala are one of the
most common prey species for all predators and need to be constantly
alert. Impala have good hearing and eyesight, raising an alarm when
danger is near. Baboons use trees to check for danger and bark an alarm
when danger is sensed. What do the baboons receive? Male baboons
sometimes prey on young impala soon after birth. So, though both alert
others to dangers, sometimes this is not the best of relationships for
young impala.

Zebra and wildebeest are found together on the African savanna grazing
different parts of the same grass. The zebra grazes the tougher parts of
the plant, saving the softer parts for the wildebeest. A zebra will move
into an area of tall grass before other herbivores and graze the grass
down to the area that the wildebeest prefers.

#### Importance to Humans {#11.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSB0byBIdW1hbnM._22-uiv}

We see examples of mammals (other than people!) serving our needs
everywhere. We have pets that are mammals, such as dogs and cats.
Mammals are also used around the world for transport. For example,
horses, donkeys, mules, or camels ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfY2FtZWw.) ) may be the primary means of
transport in some parts of the world. Mammals also do work for us.
**Service dogs** can be trained to help the disabled. These include
guide dogs, which are assistance dogs trained to lead blind and visually
impaired people around obstacles. Horses and elephants can carry heavy
loads. Humans also use some mammals for food. For example, cows and
goats are commonly raised for their milk and meat. Mammals’ more highly
developed brains have made them ideal for use by scientists in studying
such things as learning, as seen in maze studies of mice and rats.

#### Cultural Importance {#11.html#x-ck12-Q3VsdHVyYWwgSW1wb3J0YW5jZQ.._22-qat}

Mammals have also played a significant role in different cultures’
folklore and religion. For example, the grace and power of the cougar
have been admired in the cultures of the native peoples of the Americas.
The Inca city of Cuzco is designed in the shape of a cougar, and the
thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.
In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared
in the stories of several American Indian tribes.

Important mammals include Dolly the sheep, Lassie the dog, and flipper
the dolphin. Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult
somatic (body) cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. Lassie was a
collie dog who appeared in seven full length feature films in the 1940s
and 1950s, starting with *Lassie Come Home* in 1943. Additional Lassie
movies were made as recently as 2005. Between 1954 and 1973, the
*Lassie* television series aired, with plenty of additional productions
as recently as 2007. Flipper was a bottle nose dolphin that starred in a
television series between 1964 and 1967. The most famous mammal may be
*King Kong,* the giant gorilla that terrorized New York City in 1933 in
the movie of the same name.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-04p}

-   Ecologically, nectar-feeding and fruit-eating bats play an important
    role in plant pollination and seed dispersal, respectively.
-   Mammals meet people's needs by serving as pets, transport, food, or
    research subjects.

**How are the monkey and the girl alike?**

Both are intelligent and can learn new things quickly. They both like to
play. And they are both primates.

### What Are Primates? {#11.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgUHJpbWF0ZXM__23-fip}

If primates are mammals, what makes them seem so different from most
mammals? Primates, including humans, have several unique features. Some
adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain
habitats, such as in trees. Other features have allowed them to adapt to
complex social and cultural situations.

Primates are mostly **omnivorous** , meaning many primate species eat
both plant and animal material. The order contains all of the species
commonly related to lemurs, monkeys, and apes. The order also includes
humans ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yNC1vbW5pdm9yZXM.) ).

</div>

Key features of primates include:

-   Five fingers, known as **pentadactyl** .
-   Several types of teeth.
-   Certain eye orbit characteristics, such as a **postorbital bar** ,
    or a bone that runs around the eye socket.
-   An **opposable thumb** , a finger that allows a grip that can
    hold objects.

What's the difference between monkeys and apes? The easiest way to
distinguish monkeys from the other primates is to look for a tail. Most
monkey species have tails, but no apes or humans do. Monkeys are much
more like other mammals than apes and humans are.

#### Big Brains {#11.html#x-ck12-QmlnIEJyYWlucw.._23-hf0}

In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger
compared to the rest of the brain. A larger cerebrum allows primates to
develop higher levels of intelligence. Primates have the ability to
learn new behaviors. They also engage in complex social interactions,
such as fighting and play.

#### Social Relationships {#11.html#x-ck12-U29jaWFsIFJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHM._23-uvx}

Old World species, such as apes and some monkeys ( **Figure**
[above](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yNC1vbW5pdm9yZXM.) and **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yOC1OZXctV29ybGQ.) ), tend to have
significant size differences between the sexes. This is known as
**sexual dimorphism** . Males tend to be slightly more than twice as
heavy as females. This dimorphism may have evolved when one male had to
defend many females. *Old World* generally refers to monkeys of Africa
and Asia. *New World* refers to monkeys of the Americas.

New World species, including tamarins (squirrel-sized monkeys) and
marmosets (very small primitive monkeys) ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0yOC1OZXctV29ybGQ.) ), form **pair
bonds** , which is a partnership between a mating pair that lasts at
least one season. The pair cooperatively raise the young and generally
do not show a significant size difference between the sexes. Old World
monkeys do not tend to form monogamous relationships.

#### Where Do Non-human Primates Live? {#11.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgRG8gTm9uLWh1bWFuIFByaW1hdGVzIExpdmU__23-5nx}

Non-human primates live mostly in Central and South America, Africa, and
South Asia. Since primates evolved from animals living in trees, many
modern species still live mostly in trees. Other species live on land
most of the time, such as baboons ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0zMS1iYWJvb25z) ) and the Patas
monkey. Only a few species live on land all of the time, such as the
gelada and humans.

her young.

</div>

Primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats, including rain
forests, mangrove forests and mountain forests to altitudes of over
9,800 feet. The combination of opposable thumbs, short fingernails, and
long, inward-closing fingers has allowed some species to develop the
ability to move by swinging their arms from one branch to another (
**Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNDAzLTA4LW1vbmtleS1hZGFwdGF0aW9ucw..) ).
Another feature for climbing are expanded finger-like parts, such as
those in tarsiers, which improve grasping ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNDAzLTA4LW1vbmtleS1hZGFwdGF0aW9ucw..) ).

A few species, such as the proboscis monkey, De Brazza’s monkey, and
Allen’s swamp monkey, evolved webbed fingers so they can swim and live
in swamps and aquatic habitats. Some species, such as the rhesus macaque
and the Hanuman langur, can even live in cities by eating human garbage.

**What animals are humans' closest cousins?**

Looking at our evolutionary tree, our closest relatives include the
orangutans pictured here. Notice the way this mother cradles her child;
they look very human-like. Orangutans are also highly intelligent.
Notice the detail in the hand. In the wild, they can create and use
tools.

### Humans and Primates {#11.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW5zIGFuZCBQcmltYXRlcw.._24-2p7}

The great apes are the members of the biological family Hominidae, which
includes four living genera: chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and
humans. Among these four genera are just seven species, two of each
except humans, which has only one species, *Homo sapiens.*

#### Characteristics {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNz_24-ybn}

The Great Apes are large, tailless primates, ranging in size from the
pygmy chimpanzee, at 66-88 pounds in weight, to the gorilla, at 300-400
pounds ( **Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0zNS1nb3JpbGxh) ).
In all species, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than the
females.

largest of the hominids, weighing up to 309-397 lbs.

</div>

Most living primate species are four-footed, but all are able to use
their hands for gathering food or nesting materials. In some cases,
hands are used as tools, such as when gorillas use sticks to measure the
depth of water ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0zNi1nb3JpbGxhLXRvb2wtdXNl) ).
Chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as spears in hunting; they also use
sticks to gather food and to “fish” for termites.

</div>

Most primate species eat both plants and meat ( **omnivorous** ), but
fruit is the preferred food among all but humans. In contrast, humans
eat a large amount of highly processed, low fiber foods, and unusual
proportions of grains and vertebrate meat. As a result of our diets,
human teeth and jaws are markedly smaller for our size than those of
other apes. Humans may have been eating cooked food for a million years
or more, so perhaps our teeth adapted to eating cooked food.

Gestation (pregnancy) lasts 8-9 months and usually results in the birth
of a single offspring. The young are born helpless, and thus, they need
parental care for long periods of time. Compared with most other
mammals, great apes have a long adolescence and are not fully mature
until 8-13 years of age (longer in humans). Females usually give birth
only once every few years.

Gorillas and chimpanzees live in family groups of approximately five to
ten individuals, although larger groups are sometimes observed. The
groups include at least one dominant male, and females leave the group
when they can mate. Orangutans, however, generally live alone.

#### Genetic and Behavioral Similarities {#11.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBhbmQgQmVoYXZpb3JhbCBTaW1pbGFyaXRpZXM._24-y3t}

Gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans have more than 97% of their DNA
sequence in common. This means that a similar percent of the amino acid
sequences of the proteins will be the same, resulting in many proteins
with similar or identical functions.

All organisms in the Hominidae communicate with some kind of language.
They can also create simple **cultures** beyond the family or group of
animals. Having a culture means that knowledge and behaviors can be
passed on from generation to generation.

#### Specialized Human Features {#11.html#x-ck12-U3BlY2lhbGl6ZWQgSHVtYW4gRmVhdHVyZXM._24-5k1}

Specialized features of *Homo sapiens* include the following:

-   small front teeth (canines and incisors) and very large molars
    relative to other primate species,
-   a fully upright posture resulting in bipedalism (walking on two
    limbs instead of four),
-   shortening of the arms relative to the legs,
-   increased usefulness (dexterity) of the hands,
-   increase in brain size, especially in the frontal lobes
-   and a decrease in bone mass of the skull and face.

## Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-eq5}

Vertebrates. From fish to mammals. Obviously, there is a tremendous
amount of differences among these groups of species. But there also
exist many similarities. Fish had to evolve first. Then they moved onto
land as amphibians, but they still had to live close to the water. Then
they moved farther away from the water as reptiles. Reptiles could live
anywhere, and they did. Reptiles became very large and dominated life on
the planet. Some reptiles evolved flight and turned into birds. Others
stayed small and became mammals. When all the large reptiles were
extinct, what remained? Smaller animals, including mammals, which then
became the dominant form of life.

**Do cells work together?**

Cells, like these nerve cells, do not work in isolation. To send orders
from your brain to your legs, for example, signals pass through many
nerve cells. These cells work together to perform a similar function.
Just as muscle cells work together, bone cells and many other cells do
as well. A group of similar cells that work together is known as a
tissue.

### Organization of Your Body: Cells, Tissues, Organs {#12.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5pemF0aW9uIG9mIFlvdXIgQm9keTogQ2VsbHMsIFRpc3N1ZXMsIE9yZ2Fucw..-oxh}

**Cells** are grouped together to carry out specific functions. A group
of cells that work together form a **tissue** . Your body has four main
types of tissues, as do the bodies of other animals. These tissues make
up all structures and contents of your body. An example of each tissue
type is pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wMi1ib2R5LXRpc3N1ZXM.) .

tissue](ck12_12_files/20150911113716737493.png "The four main types of tissue are nervous tissue, epithelial tissue, connective tissue, and muscle tissue")

**Figure 12.1**

Your body has four main types of tissue: nervous tissue, epithelial
tissue, connective tissue, and muscle tissue. They are found throughout
your body.

</div>

1.  **Epithelial tissue** is made up of layers of tightly packed cells
    that line the surfaces of the body. Examples of epithelial tissue
    include the skin, the lining of the mouth and nose, and the lining
    of the digestive system.
2.  **Connective tissue** is made up of many different types of cells
    that are all involved in supporting and binding other tissues of
    the body. Examples include tendon, cartilage, and bone. Blood is
    also classified as a specialized connective tissue.
3.  **Muscle tissue** is made up of bands of cells that contract and
    allow movement.
4.  **Nervous tissue** is made up of nerve cells that sense stimuli and
    transmit signals. Nervous tissue is found in nerves, the spinal
    cord, and the brain.

#### Groups of Tissues Form Organs {#12.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXBzIG9mIFRpc3N1ZXMgRm9ybSBPcmdhbnM.-8t0}

A single tissue alone cannot do all the jobs that are needed to keep you
alive and healthy. Two or more tissues working together can do a lot
more. An **organ** is a structure made of two or more tissues that work
together. The heart ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wMy1mb3VyLXRpc3N1ZXMtaGVhcnQ.) ) is
made up of the four types of tissues.

The four different tissue types work together in the heart as they do in
the other organs.

</div>

#### Groups of Organs Form Organ Systems {#12.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXBzIG9mIE9yZ2FucyBGb3JtIE9yZ2FuIFN5c3RlbXM.-utr}

Your heart pumps blood around your body. But how does your heart get
blood to and from every cell in your body? Your heart is connected to
blood vessels such as veins and arteries. Organs that work together form
an **organ system** . Together, your heart, blood, and blood vessels
form your **cardiovascular system** .

What other organ systems can you think of?

#### Organ Systems Work Together {#12.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW4gU3lzdGVtcyBXb3JrIFRvZ2V0aGVy-tuo}

Your body’s 12 organ systems are shown below ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TWFqb3ItT3JnYW4tU3lzdGVtcy1vZi10aGUtSHVtYW4tQm9keQ..)
). Your organ systems do not work alone in your body. They must all be
able to work together.

For example, one of the most important functions of organ systems is to
provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove toxic waste
products such as carbon dioxide. A number of organ systems, including
the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, all work together to do
this.

**How does your body react to cold?**

These people may be having fun in the icy water, but their bodies are
struggling to react to the cold. For example, they may begin to shiver.
Shivering helps the body return to a stable temperature. The body is
always working to achieve stability, or homeostasis.

### Homeostasis and Feedback Regulation {#12.html#x-ck12-SG9tZW9zdGFzaXMgYW5kIEZlZWRiYWNrIFJlZ3VsYXRpb24._1-glm}

When you walk outside on a cool day, does your body temperature drop?
No, your body temperature stays stable at around 98.6 degrees
Fahrenheit. Even when the temperature around you changes, your internal
temperature stays the same.

This ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment
despite a changing environment is called **homeostasis** . Homeostasis
doesn't just protect against temperature changes. Other aspects of your
internal environment also stay stable. For example, your body closely
regulates your fluid balance. You may have noticed that if you are
slightly dehydrated, your urine is darker. That's because the urine is
more concentrated and less water is mixed in with it.

#### Maintaining Homeostasis {#12.html#x-ck12-TWFpbnRhaW5pbmcgSG9tZW9zdGFzaXM._1-qcr}

So how does your body maintain homeostasis? The regulation of your
internal environment is done primarily through **negative feedback.**
Negative feedback is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable
close to a set value ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNC1GZWVkYmFjay1sb29w) ).
Essentially, it "shuts off" or "turns on" a system when it varies from a
set value.

For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day,
in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds
by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way.
When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense
the temperature change. The temperature change triggers a command from
the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot,
the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate.
This response helps decrease body temperature.

Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose
levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the
pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the
conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As
blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose
levels are too low, another **hormone** called glucagon is produced,
which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose.

**Figure 12.3**

Feedback Regulation. If a raise in body temperature (stimulus) is
detected (receptor), a signal will cause the brain to maintain
homeostasis (response). Once the body temperature returns to normal,
negative feedback will cause the response to end. This sequence of
stimulus-receptor-signal-response is used throughout the body to
maintain homeostasis.

</div>

#### Positive Feedback {#12.html#x-ck12-UG9zaXRpdmUgRmVlZGJhY2s._1-lgh}

Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback.
**Positive feedback** is when a response to an event increases the
likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is
milk production in nursing mothers. As the baby drinks her mother's
milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more
the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk
to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions
during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the
birth canal, additional contractions occur.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-hdt}

-   Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal
    environment despite a changing external environment.
-   Homeostasis is maintained primarily through negative feedback, when
    a response to a stimulus keeps a variable close to a set value.

**Why is your skin important?**

Some people put a lot of time and money into maintaining their skin.
They may use special creams and lotions. While expensive creams may not
be necessary, it is a good idea to take care of your skin. It does a lot
of things for you, from protecting you from disease to sensing your
environment.

### Your Skin {#12.html#x-ck12-WW91ciBTa2lu_2-crk}

Did you know that you see the largest organ in your body every day? You
wash it, dry it, cover it up to stay warm, and uncover it to cool off.
Yes, your skin is your body's largest organ. Your skin is part of your
**integumentary system** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNS1Ta2lu) ), which is the outer
covering of your body. The integumentary system is made up of your skin,
hair, and nails.

**Figure 12.4**

Skin acts as a barrier that stops water and other things, like soap and
dirt, from getting into your body.

</div>

The skin has many important functions. The skin:

-   Provides a barrier. It keeps organisms that could harm the body out.
    It stops water from entering or leaving the body.
-   Controls body temperature. It does this by making sweat (or
    **perspiration** ), a watery substance that cools the body when
    it evaporates.
-   Gathers information about your environment. Special nerve endings in
    your skin sense heat, pressure, cold, and pain.
-   Helps the body get rid of some types of waste, which are removed
    in sweat.
-   Acts as a sun block. A pigment called **melanin** blocks sunlight
    from getting to deeper layers of skin cells, which are easily
    damaged by sunlight.

#### Structure of Skin {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIFNraW4._2-4yq}

Your skin is always exposed to your external environment, so it gets
cut, scratched, and worn down. You also naturally shed many skin cells
every day. Your body replaces damaged or missing skin cells by growing
more of them. Did you know that the layer of skin you can see is
actually dead? As the dead cells are shed or removed from the upper
layer, they are replaced by the skin cells below them.

Two different layers make up the skin: the epidermis and the dermis (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNi1za2luLWxheWVycw..) ).
A fatty layer lies under the dermis, but it is not part of your skin.

![Illustration of the layers of
skin](ck12_12_files/20150911113718073124.jpeg "Illustration of the layers of skin")

**Figure 12.5**

Skin is made up of two layers, the epidermis on top and the dermis
below. The tissue below the dermis is called the hypodermis, but it is
not part of the skin.

</div>

#### The Epidermis {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVwaWRlcm1pcw.._2-uah}

The **epidermis** is the outermost layer of the skin. It forms the
waterproof, protective wrap over the body's surface. Although the top
layer of epidermis is only about as thick as a sheet of paper, it is
made up of 25 to 30 layers of cells. The epidermis also contains cells
that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin
and hair their color. Melanin-producing cells are found in the bottom
layer of the epidermis. The epidermis does not have any blood vessels.
The lower part of the epidermis receives blood by diffusion from blood
vessels of the dermis.

#### The Dermis {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIERlcm1pcw.._2-ibp}

The **dermis** is the layer of skin directly under the epidermis. It is
made of a tough connective tissue. The dermis contains hair follicles,
sweat glands, oil glands, and blood vessels ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNi1za2luLWxheWVycw..) ). It also
holds many nerve endings that give you your sense of touch, pressure,
heat, and pain.

Do you ever notice how your hair stands up when you are cold or afraid?
Tiny muscles in the dermis pull on hair follicles which cause hair to
stand up. The resulting little bumps in the skin are commonly called
"goosebumps" ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNy1nb29zZWJ1bXBz) ).

#### Oil Glands and Sweat Glands {#12.html#x-ck12-T2lsIEdsYW5kcyBhbmQgU3dlYXQgR2xhbmRz_2-gzo}

Glands and hair follicles open out into the epidermis, but they start in
the dermis. Oil glands ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNi1za2luLWxheWVycw..) ) release, or
secrete an oily substance, called **sebum** , into the hair follicle.
Sebum “waterproofs” hair and the skin surface to prevent them from
drying out. It can also stop the growth of bacteria on the skin. It is
odorless, but the breakdown of sebum by bacteria can cause odors. If an
oil gland becomes plugged and infected, it develops into a pimple. Up to
85% of teenagers get pimples, which usually go away by adulthood.
Frequent washing can help decrease the amount of sebum on the skin.

**Sweat glands** ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNi1za2luLWxheWVycw..) ) open to the
skin surface through skin pores. They are found all over the body.
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface helps to lower skin
temperature. The skin also releases excess water, salts, sugars, and
other wastes, such as ammonia and urea, in sweat.

**Why do you have arm hair?**

Hair covers much of our bodies. But why? Think of the way that you can
sense something brush against your arm. Your arm hair is important in
providing this type of sensation and making you aware of your
environment. Also, hair can trap heat and keep your body warm.

### Hair and Nails {#12.html#x-ck12-SGFpciBhbmQgTmFpbHM._3-ik8}

Along with the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and
hair. Both the nails and hair contain the tough protein, **keratin.**
The keratin forms fibers, which makes your nails and hair tough and
strong. Keratin is similar in toughness to chitin, the carbohydrate
found in the exoskeleton of arthropods.

#### Nails {#12.html#x-ck12-TmFpbHM._3-267}

Nails are similar to claws in other animals. They cover the tips of
fingers and toes. Fingernails and toenails both grow from nail beds. As
the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed. Older cells get
pushed away from the nail bed and the nail grows longer. There are no
nerve endings in the nail. Otherwise cutting your nails would hurt a
lot!

Nails act as protective plates over the fingertips and toes. Fingernails
also help in sensing the environment. The area under your nail has many
nerve endings. These nerve endings allow you to receive more information
about objects you touch.

The *Guinness Book of World Records* began tracking record fingernail
lengths in 1955. At that time the record was 1 foot 10.75 inches long.
The current record-holder for men is from India, with a record of 20
feet 2.25 inches for all nails on his left hand, the longest being his
thumbnail at 4 feet 9.6 inches. The record for women is held by an
American woman. The record is 28 feet (850 cm) for all nails of both
hands, with the longest nail on her right thumb at 2 feet 11 inches.
Since adult nails grow at about 3 mm a month (1/10 of an inch), how long
would it take to grow such long nails?

#### Hair {#12.html#x-ck12-SGFpcg.._3-f5h}

Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. In fact, mammals
are the only animals to have hair. Hair sticks out from the epidermis,
but it grows from the dermis ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wOS1oYWly) ). Hair grows from inside
the **hair follicle** . New cells grow in the bottom part of the hair,
called the bulb. Older cells get pushed up, and the hair grows longer.
The cells that make up the hair strand are dead and filled with the
rope-like protein keratin.

**Figure 12.7**

Hair, hair follicle, and oil glands. The oil, called sebum, helps to
prevent water loss from the skin. The sebaceous gland secretes sebum,
which waterproofs the skin and hair.

</div>

In humans, hair grows everywhere on the body except the soles of the
feet and the palms of the hands, the lips, and the eyelids (except for
eyelashes). Hair grows at a rate of about half an inch (1.25 cm) each
month, or about 6 inches (15 cm) a year.

Hair, especially on the head, helps to keep the body warm. The air traps
a layer of warm air near the skin and acts like a warm blanket. Hair can
also act as a filter. Nose hair helps to trap particles in the air that
may otherwise travel to the lungs. Eyelashes shield eyes from dust and
sunlight. Eyebrows stop salty sweat and rain from flowing into the eye.

The world's longest documented hair, according to Guinness World
Records, belongs to Xie Qiuping of China at just under 18 feet 6 inches
(5.627 m) when measured on May 8, 2004. She had been growing her hair
since 1973 when she was 13 years old.

**Why shower every day?**

Of course, showering every day keeps you feeling and smelling fresh. But
keeping clean is also good for your health! For example, a shower or
bath washes away bacteria and viruses that could harm you.

### Keeping Skin Healthy {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBTa2luIEhlYWx0aHk._4-fbr}

Your skin is your largest organ and constantly protects you from
infections, so keeping your skin healthy is a good idea.

#### Avoiding Sunburn {#12.html#x-ck12-QXZvaWRpbmcgU3VuYnVybg.._4-osl}

Some sunlight is good for your health. **Vitamin D** is made in the skin
when it is exposed to sunlight. But getting too much sun can be
unhealthy. A **sunburn** is a burn to the skin that is caused by
overexposure to UV radiation from the sun's rays or tanning beds.

Light-skinned people, like the man pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xMC1zdW5idXJu) ), get sunburned more
quickly than people with darker skin. This is because pigments (melanin)
in the skin act as a natural sunblock that help to protect the body from
UV radiation.

With over one million new cases each year, skin cancer, which is cancer
that forms in the tissues of the skin, is the most common form of human
cancer. Children and teens who have been sunburned are at a greater risk
of developing skin cancer later in life. Long-term exposure to UV
radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. About 90 percent of skin
cancers are linked to sun exposure. UV radiation damages the genetic
material (DNA) of skin cells. This damage can cause the skin cells to
grow out of control and form a tumor. Some of these tumors are very
difficult to cure. For this reason you should always wear sunscreen with
a high sun protection factor (SPF), a hat, and clothing when out in the
sun.

#### Keeping Clean {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBDbGVhbg.._4-gty}

Keeping your skin clean is important because dirty skin is more prone to
infection. Bathing every day helps to keep your skin clean and healthy.
Also, you know that taking a bath or shower helps prevent body odor. But
where does body odor come from? During the day, sweat, oil, dirt, dust,
and dead skin cells can build up on the skin surface. If not washed
away, the mix of these materials can encourage the excess growth of
bacteria. These bacteria feed on these substances and cause a smell that
is commonly called body odor.

#### Skin Disorders {#12.html#x-ck12-U2tpbiBEaXNvcmRlcnM._4-4jt}

Conditions that irritate, clog or inflame your skin can cause symptoms
such as redness, swelling, burning and itching. Allergies, irritants,
your genetic background and certain diseases and immune system problems
can cause numerous skin conditions. Many skin problems, such as acne,
also affect your appearance.

##### Acne {#12.html#x-ck12-QWNuZQ.._4-ctv}

Your skin has tiny holes called pores that that can become blocked by
oil, bacteria, dead skin and dirt. When this occurs, you may develop a
pimple. Acne is a skin condition that causes pimples, and is one of the
more common skin problem among teenagers. A diet high in refined sugars
or carbohydrates such as bread and chips can also lead to acne.

Each pore on your skin is the opening to a follicle, which is made of a
hair and sebaceous gland that releases sebum. Acne may result from too
much sebum produced by the follicle, dead skin cells accumulating in the
pore, or bacteria built up in the pore. Cleaning your skin daily with a
mild soap to remove excess oil and dirt can help prevent acne.

##### Cold Sores {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29sZCBTb3Jlcw.._4-9hc}

Cold sores are red, fluid-filled blisters that appear near the mouth or
on other areas of the face, usually caused by herpes simplex virus type
1. Visible sores are contagious, but herpes may be spread even when
sores can’t be seen. You can catch the herpes simplex virus through
kissing, sharing cosmetics, or sharing food with infected individuals.
Once you catch herpes simplex virus, it can’t be cured. Even after sores
have healed, the virus remains in your body, and new cold sores can
appear at any time. This is not to be confused with genital herpes,
which is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2.

##### Canker Sore {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2Fua2VyIFNvcmU._4-x7l}

A canker sore is a mouth ulcer or sore that is open and painful. They
may be on the lips or inside of the lip or cheek. Canker sores are
usually white or yellowish, surrounded by red, inflamed soft tissue. A
canker sore can be either a simple canker or a complex canker. A simple
canker sore reemerges about three to four times every year, and is the
common type in people between the ages of 10 and 20. Canker sores are
not contagious and usually heal on their own within a week or two.
Causes of canker sores include a viral infection, stress, hormonal
fluctuations, food allergies, immune system problems, or mouth injuries.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-m3e}

-   Bathing every day helps to keep your skin clean and healthy.
-   Excessive exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds is

**Are bones alive?**

From seeing a skeleton, you might think that bones are just dead, hollow
structures. But in a living person, those hollow spaces are full of
living cells. Bones have a blood supply and nerves. Bones are a living
tissue.

### Your Skeleton {#12.html#x-ck12-WW91ciBTa2VsZXRvbg.._5-iqv}

How important is your skeleton? Can you imagine your body without it?
You would be a wobbly pile of muscle and internal organs, and you would
not be able to move.

The adult human skeleton has 206 bones, some of which are named below (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xMi1za2VsZXRhbC1zeXN0ZW0.)
). Bones are made up of living tissue. They contain many different types
of tissues. **Cartilage,** a dense connective tissue, is found at the
end of bones and is made of tough protein fibers. Cartilage creates
smooth surfaces for the movement of bones that are next to each other,
like the bones of the knee.

**Ligaments** are made of tough protein fibers and connect bones to each
other. Your bones, cartilage, and ligaments make up your **skeletal
system** .

**Figure 12.9**

The skeletal system is made up of bones, cartilage, and ligaments. The
skeletal system has many important functions in your body. What bones
protect the heart and lungs? What protects the brain?

</div>

#### Functions of Bones {#12.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIEJvbmVz_5-uw2}

Your skeletal system gives shape and form to your body, but it also
plays other important roles. The main functions of the skeletal system
include:

-   Support. The skeleton supports the body against the pull of gravity,
    meaning you don't fall over when you stand up. The large bones of
    the lower limbs support the rest of the body when standing.
-   Protection. The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of
    the body. For example, the skull surrounds the brain to protect it
    from injury. The bones of the rib cage help protect the heart
    and lungs.
-   Movement. Bones work together with muscles to move the body.
-   Making blood cells. Blood cells are mostly made inside certain types
    of bones.
-   Storage. Bones store calcium. They contain more calcium than any
    other organ. Calcium is released by the bones when blood levels of
    calcium drop too low. The mineral, phosphorus is also stored
    in bones.

#### Structure of Bones {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIEJvbmVz_5-ees}

Bones come in many different shapes and sizes, but they are all made of
the same materials. Bones are organs, and recall that organs are made up
of two or more types of tissues.

The two main types of bone tissue are compact bone and spongy bone (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xMy10aXNzdWVzLWluLWJvbmU.)
).

-   **Compact bone** makes up the dense outer layer of bones.
-   **Spongy bone** is found at the center of the bone and is lighter
    and more porous than compact bone.

Bones look tough, shiny, and white because they are covered by a layer
called the **periosteum** . Many bones also contain a soft connective
tissue called **bone marrow** in the pores of the spongy bone. Bone
marrow is where blood cells are made.

#### Bone Growth {#12.html#x-ck12-Qm9uZSBHcm93dGg._5-nr1}

Early in human development, the skeleton consists of only cartilage and
other connective tissues. At this point, the skeleton is very flexible.
As the fetus develops, hard bone begins to replace the cartilage, and
the skeleton begins to harden. Not all of the cartilage, however, is
replaced by bone. Cartilage remains in many places in your body,
including your joints, your rib cage, your ears, and the tip of your
nose.

A baby is born with zones of cartilage in its bones that allow growth of
the bones. These areas, called **growth plates** , allow the bones to
grow longer as the child grows. By the time the child reaches an age of
about 18 to 25 years, all of the cartilage in the growth plate has been
replaced by bone. This stops the bone from growing any longer. Even
though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can
continue to increase in thickness throughout life. This thickening
occurs in response to strain from increased muscle activity and from
weight-lifting exercises.

**Why does his knee hurt?**

As you age, you might start noticing pain in your knees or elbows. These
are examples of joints. Joints are the part of the skeletal system that
connect your bones. Joint pain is a common problem as people age.

### Joints and How They Move {#12.html#x-ck12-Sm9pbnRzIGFuZCBIb3cgVGhleSBNb3Zl_6-pmc}

A **joint** is a point at which two or more bones meet. There are three
main types of joints in the body:

1.  **Fixed joints** do not allow any bone movement. Many of the joints
    in your skull are fixed ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xNC1maXhlZC1qb2ludHMtc2t1bGw.) ).
    There are eight bones that fuse together to form the cranium. The
    joints between these bones do not allow movement, which helps
    protect the brain.

**Figure 12.11**

The skull has fixed joints. Fixed joints do not allow any movement of
the bones, which protects the brain from injury.

</div>

2.  **Partly movable joints** allow only a little movement. Your
    backbone has partly movable joints between the vertebrae (
    **Figure**

**Figure 12.12**

The joints between your vertebrae are partially movable.

</div>

3.  **Movable joints** allow the most movement.

Movable joints are also the most common type of joint in your body. Your
fingers, toes, hips, elbows, and knees all provide examples of movable
joints. The surfaces of bones at movable joints are covered with a
smooth layer of cartilage. The cartilage reduces friction between the
bones. Ligaments often cross a joint, holding two nones together. For
example, there are numerous ligaments connecting the leg bones across
the knee joint.

#### Types of Movable Joints {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTW92YWJsZSBKb2ludHM._6-hxd}

Four types of movable joints are discussed here.

1.  In a **ball-and-socket joint** , the ball-shaped surface of one bone
    fits into the cup-like shape of another. Examples of a
    ball-and-socket joint include the hip ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xNi1iYWxsLXNvY2tldC1oaXA.) ) and
    the shoulder.

Your hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint. The “ball” end of one bone
fits into the “socket” of another bone. These joints can move in many
different directions.

2.  In a **hinge joint** , the ends of the bones are shaped in a way
    that allows motion in two directions, forward and backward. Examples
    of hinge joints are the knees ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xNy1oaW5nZS1qb2ludC1rbmVl) )
    and elbows.

    The gliding joint allows one bone to slide over the other. The
    gliding joint in your wrist allows you to flex your wrist. It also
    allows you to make very small side-to-side motions. There are also
    gliding joints in your ankles.

**Why drink milk?**

Milk is naturally a good source of calcium. Vitamin D is also often
added to milk. Both these nutrients help build strong bones.

### Keeping Bones and Joints Healthy {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBCb25lcyBhbmQgSm9pbnRzIEhlYWx0aHk._7-koy}

You can help keep your bones and skeletal system healthy by eating well
and getting enough exercise. Weight-bearing exercises help keep bones
strong. Weight-bearing exercises and activities work against gravity.
Such activities include basketball, tennis, gymnastics, karate, running,
and walking. When the body is exercised regularly by performing
weight-bearing activity, bones respond by adding more bone cells to
increase their bone density.

#### Eating Well {#12.html#x-ck12-RWF0aW5nIFdlbGw._7-xuo}

Did you know that what you eat as a teenager can affect how healthy your
skeletal system will be in 30, 40, and even 50 years? **Calcium** and
**vitamin D** are two of the most important nutrients for a healthy
skeletal system. Your bones need calcium to grow properly. If you do not
get enough calcium in your diet as a teenager, your bones may become
weak and break easily later in life.

**Osteoporosis** is a disease in which bones lose mass and become more
fragile than they should be. Osteoporosis also makes bones more likely
to break. Two of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis are eating a
healthy diet that has the right amount of calcium and vitamin D and to
do some sort of weight-bearing exercise every day. Foods that are a good
source of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese. Non-dairy sources of
calcium include Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Many fruit juices,
fruit drinks, tofu, and cereals have calcium added to them. It is
recommended that teenagers get 1300 mg of calcium every day. For
example, one cup (8 fl. oz.) of milk provides about 300 mg of calcium,
or about 30% of the daily requirement. Other sources of calcium are
pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0xOS1jYWxjaXVtLXNvdXJjZXM.) .

**Figure 12.16**

There are many different sources of calcium. Getting enough calcium in
your daily diet is important for good bone health.

</div>

Vitamin D is unusual since you don't have to rely on your diet alone to
get enough of this vitamin. Your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to
sunlight. Pigments in the skin act like a filter that can prevent the
skin from making vitamin D. As a result, people with darker skin need
more time in the sun than people with lighter skin to make the same
amount of vitamin D.

You can also get vitamin D from foods. Fish is naturally rich in vitamin
D. In the United States, vitamin D is added to other foods, including
milk, soy milk, and breakfast cereals. Teenagers are recommended to get
5 micrograms (200 IU) of vitamin D every day. A 3½-ounce portion of
cooked salmon provides 360 IU of vitamin D. A 8-ounce glass of milk is
fortified with about 100 IU of vitamin D.

#### Bone Fractures {#12.html#x-ck12-Qm9uZSBGcmFjdHVyZXM._7-4am}

Even though they are very strong, bones can **fracture** , or break.
Fractures can happen at different places on a bone. They are usually
caused by excess bending stress on the bone. Bending stress is what
causes a pencil to break if you bend it too far.

Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break. The area
becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days, bone cells travel to the
break site and begin to rebuild the bone. It takes about two to three
months before compact and spongy bone form at the break site. Sometimes
the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone. In such a case, a
surgeon will piece a broken bone together with metal pins. Moving the
broken pieces together will help keep the bone from moving and give the
body a chance to repair the break. Below, a broken ulna has been
repaired with pins ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0yMC11bG5hLWZyYWN0dXJlLXhyYXlz) ).

**Osteoarthritis** occurs when the cartilage at the ends of the bones
breaks down. The break down of the cartilage leads to pain and stiffness
in the joint. Decreased movement of the joint because of the pain may
lead to weakening of the muscles that normally move the joint, and the
ligaments surrounding the joint may become loose. Osteoarthritis is the
most common form of **arthritis** . It has many contributing factors,
including aging, sport injuries, fractures, and obesity.

#### Ligament Injuries {#12.html#x-ck12-TGlnYW1lbnQgSW5qdXJpZXM._7-qao}

Recall that a **ligament** is a short band of tough connective tissue
that connects bones together to form a joint. Ligaments can get injured
when a joint gets twisted or bends too far. The protein fibers that make
up a ligament can get strained or torn, causing swelling and pain.
Injuries to ligaments are called **sprains** . Ankle sprains are a
common type of sprain.

#### Preventing Injuries {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBJbmp1cmllcw.._7-3cj}

Preventing injuries to your bones and ligaments is easier and much less
painful than treating an injury. Wearing the correct safety equipment
when performing activities that require such equipment can help prevent
many common injuries. For example, wearing a bicycle helmet can help
prevent a skull injury if you fall. Warming up and cooling down properly
can help prevent ligament and muscle injuries. Stretching before and
after activity also helps prevent injuries.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-txy}

**Does the heart have muscles?**

When you think of muscles, you might think of biceps and the external
muscles you see in a bodybuilder. However, some muscles are found deep
inside your body. The heart, for example, is a very muscular organ. It
has to pump blood all around your body.

### Types of Muscles {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTXVzY2xlcw.._8-kps}

The **muscular system** consists of all the muscles in the body. This is
the body system that allows us to move. You also depend on many muscles
to keep you alive. Your heart, which is mostly muscle, pumps blood
around your body.

Each muscle in the body is made up of cells called muscle fibers.
**Muscle fibers** are long, thin cells that can do something that other
cells cannot do—they are able to get shorter. Shortening of muscle
fibers is called **contraction** . Muscle fibers can contract because
they are made of proteins, called actin and myosin, that form long
filaments (or fibers). When muscles contract, these protein filaments
slide or glide past one another, shortening the length of the cell. When
your muscles relax, the length extends back to the previous position.
Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction.

You can control some muscle movements. However, certain muscle movements
happen without you thinking about them. Muscles that are under your
conscious control are called **voluntary muscles** . Muscles that are
not under your conscious control are called **involuntary muscles** .

Muscle tissue is one of the four types of tissue found in animals. There
are three different types of muscle in the body ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0yMS1tdXNjbGUtdHlwZXM.) ):

1.  **Skeletal muscle** is made up of voluntary muscles, usually
    attached to the skeleton. Skeletal muscles move the body. They can
    also contract involuntarily by reflexes. For example, you can choose
    to move your arm, but your arm would move automatically if you were
    to burn your finger on a stove top. This voluntary contraction
    begins with a thought process. A signal from your brain tells your
    muscles to contract or relax. Quickly contract and relax the muscles
    in your fingers a few times. Think about how quickly these signals
    must travel throughout your body to make this happen.
2.  **Smooth muscle** is composed of involuntary muscles found within
    the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus, stomach,
    intestines, and blood vessels. These muscles push materials like
    food or blood through organs. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle
    can never be under your control.
3.  **Cardiac muscle** is also an involuntary muscle, found only in
    the heart. The cardiac muscle fibers all contract together,
    generating enough force to push blood throughout the body. What
    would happen if this muscle was under conscious or voluntary
    control?

**Do muscles come in pairs?**

This woman is doing a stretch for the muscles on the back of her legs,
the hamstrings. She also has a muscles on the front of her legs,
directly opposite the hamstrings. These are the quadriceps. The
hamstrings and quadriceps work together as a pair to move your legs back
and forth while you run.

### Muscles, Bones, and Movement {#12.html#x-ck12-TXVzY2xlcywgQm9uZXMsIGFuZCBNb3ZlbWVudA.._9-cmo}

When skeletal muscles contract, bones move. But how do muscles make your
bones move? A voluntary muscles usually works across a joint. It is
attached to both the bones on either side of the joint by strong cords
called tendons. A **tendon** is a tough band of connective tissue that
connects a muscle to a bone. Tendons are similar to ligaments, except
that ligaments join bones to each other. Muscles move the body by
contracting against the skeleton. When muscles contract, they get
shorter. By contracting, muscles pull on bones and allow the body to
move.

Muscles can only contract. They cannot actively extend, though they can
move or relax back into the non-contracted neutral position. Therefore,
to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in
opposition. Each muscle in the pair works against the other to move
bones at the joints of the body. The muscle that contracts to cause a
joint to bend is called the **flexor** . The muscle that contracts to
cause the joint to straighten is called the **extensor** . When one
muscle is contracted, the other muscle from the pair is always
elongated.

For example, the biceps and triceps muscles work together to allow you
to bend and straighten your elbow. When you want to bend your elbow,
your biceps muscle contracts ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0yMi1iaWNlcHMtdHJpY2Vwcw..) ), and, at
the same time, the triceps muscle relaxes. The biceps is the flexor, and
the triceps is the extensor of your elbow joint. Other muscles that work
together are the quadriceps and hamstrings used to bend and straighten
the knee, and the pectorals and trapezius used to move the arms and
shoulders forward and backward. During daily routines we do not use
muscles equally. For example, we use our biceps more than our triceps
due to lifting against gravity.

**Figure 12.19**

The biceps and triceps act against one another to bend and straighten

#### Smooth Muscles and Cardiac Muscles {#12.html#x-ck12-U21vb3RoIE11c2NsZXMgYW5kIENhcmRpYWMgTXVzY2xlcw.._9-xli}

Smooth muscles and cardiac muscles are not attached to bone. Recall that
these types of muscles are under involuntary control. Smooth muscle is
responsible for the contractility of hollow organs, such as blood
vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, or the uterus. Like
skeletal muscles, smooth muscle fibers do contract together, causing the
muscle to shorten. Smooth muscles have numerous functions, including the
following.

-   The smooth muscle in the uterus helps a woman to push out her baby.
-   In the bladder, smooth muscle helps to push out urine.
-   Smooth muscles move food through the digestive tract.
-   In arteries, smooth muscle movements maintain the
    arteries' diameter.
-   Smooth muscle regulates air flow in lungs.
-   Smooth muscle in the lungs helps the airways to expand and contract
    as necessary.
-   Smooth muscles in arteries and veins are largely responsible for
    regulation of blood pressure.

Cardiac muscle also contracts and gets shorter. This muscle is found
only in the heart. The sudden burst of contraction forces blood
throughout your body. When the cardiac muscle relaxes, the heart fills
with blood. This rhythmic contraction must continue for your whole life,
luckily the heart muscle never gets tired. If your heart beats 75 times
a minute, how many times does it beat in an hour? A day? A year? 85
years?

**What is aerobic exercise?**

When you hear the word "aerobic," an aerobics class may come to mind.
But that's just one type of aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise is any
exercise that strengthens your cardiovascular system—playing basketball
or swimming, for example.

### Muscles and Exercise {#12.html#x-ck12-TXVzY2xlcyBhbmQgRXhlcmNpc2U._10-d95}

Regular physical exercise is important in preventing **lifestyle
diseases** such as cardiovascular disease, some types of cancer, type 2
diabetes, and obesity. Regular exercise also improves the health of the
muscular system. Muscles that are exercised are bigger and stronger than
muscles that are not exercised.

Exercise improves both muscular strength and muscular endurance.
**Muscular strength** is the ability of a muscle to use force during a
contraction. **Muscular endurance** is the ability of a muscle to
continue to contract over a long time without getting tired.

Exercises are grouped into three types depending on the effect they have
on the body:

-   **Aerobic exercises** , such as cycling, walking, and running,
    increase muscular endurance and cardiovascular health.
-   **Anaerobic exercises** , such as weight training or sprinting,
    increase muscle strength.
-   Flexibility exercises, such as stretching, improve the range of
    motion of muscles and joints. Regular stretching helps people avoid
    activity-related injuries.

#### Anaerobic Exercise and Muscular Strength {#12.html#x-ck12-QW5hZXJvYmljIEV4ZXJjaXNlIGFuZCBNdXNjdWxhciBTdHJlbmd0aA.._10-bey}

Anaerobic exercises comprise brief periods of physical exertion and
high-intensity, strength-training activities. Anaerobic exercises cause
muscles to get bigger and stronger. Anaerobic exercises use a resistance
against which the muscle has to work to lift or push away. The
resistance can be a weight or a person’s own body weight ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0yMy1hbmFlcm9iaWMtZXhlcmNpc2U.) ).
Sports such as basketball, tennis, football and even baseball can be
anaerobic.

**Figure 12.20**

Anaerobic exercises involve the muscles working against resistance. In
this case the resistance is the weight of a barbell.

</div>

#### Aerobic Exercise and Muscular Endurance {#12.html#x-ck12-QWVyb2JpYyBFeGVyY2lzZSBhbmQgTXVzY3VsYXIgRW5kdXJhbmNl_10-kyo}

Aerobic exercises are exercises in which a low to moderate level of
exertion can be sustained over long periods. These are exercises that
cause your heart to beat faster and allow your muscles to use oxygen to
contract. If you exercise aerobically, overtime, your muscles will not
get easily tired, and you will use oxygen more efficiently. Aerobic
exercise ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0yNC1hZXJvYmljLWV4ZXJjaXNl) ) also
helps improve cardiac muscle.

#### Muscle Injuries {#12.html#x-ck12-TXVzY2xlIEluanVyaWVz_10-omr}

Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an
activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow
increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles
for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and
increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely
to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person
might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even
elite athletes need to warm up ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0yNS13YXJtaW5nLXVw) ).

When you don't do a proper warm-up, several types of injuries can occur.
A **strain** happens when muscle or tendons tear. Strains are also known
as "pulled muscles." Another common injury is **tendinitis** , the
irritation of the tendons. Strains and tendinitis are usually treated
with rest, cold compresses, and stretching exercises that a physical
therapist designs for each patient.

Injuries can also be prevented by proper rest and recovery. If you do
not get enough rest, your body will become injured and will not react
well to exercise, or improve. You can also rest by doing a different
activity. For example, if you run, you can rest your running muscles and
joints by swimming.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-h8g}

-   Aerobic exercise helps improve the cardiovascular system, while
    anaerobic exercise causes muscles to get bigger and stronger.
-   Muscle strain and tendinitis can be prevented by warming up before
    rigorous exercise and allowing your muscles to rest and recover.

**What happens when you don't eat?**

Refusing one meal won't stunt your growth. But lack of proper food over
a period of time can lead to malnutrition. That means, the body is not
getting enough nutrients to grow and stay healthy. Kids who are
malnourished may not grow as tall as they would otherwise.

### Why We Need Food {#12.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFdlIE5lZWQgRm9vZA.._11-d7b}

Did you ever hear the old saying, *An apple a day keeps the doctor away*
? Do apples really prevent you from getting sick? Probably not, but
eating apples and other fresh fruits can help keep you healthy. Do you
eat your vegetables? Maybe you do, but you may have friends who won't
touch a piece of broccoli or asparagus. Should you eat these foods and
food like them? The girls pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfc2FsYWQ.) are eating salads. Why do you
need foods like these for good health? What role does food play in the

Your body needs food for three reasons:

1.  Food gives your body energy. You need energy for everything you do.
    Remember that **cellular respiration** converts the glucose in the
    food you eat into **ATP** , or cellular energy. Which has more
    glucose, a salad or a piece of meat? Do you remember what types of
    foods produce glucose? Recall that glucose is the product
    of photosynthesis.
2.  Food provides building materials for your body. Your body needs
    building materials so it can grow and repair itself. Specifically,
    it needs these materials to produce more cells and its components.
3.  Food contains substances that help control body processes. Your body
    processes must be kept in balance for good health.

For all these reasons, you must have a regular supply of nutrients.
**Nutrients** are chemicals in food that your body needs. There are five
types of nutrients.

1.  **Carbohydrates**
2.  **Proteins**
3.  **Lipids**
4.  **Vitamins**
5.  **Minerals**

Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are categories of organic compounds.
They give your body energy, though carbohydrates are the main source of
energy. Proteins provide building materials, such as amino acids to
build your own proteins. Proteins, vitamins, and minerals also help
control body processes. Carbohydrates include sugars such as the glucose
made by photosynthesis. Often glucose is stored in large molecules such
as starch. Proteins are found in foods like meats and nuts. Lipids
includes fats and oils. Though you should stay away from many types of
fats, others are needed by your body. Important vitamins include
vitamins A, B (multiple types) C, D, and E. Important minerals include
calcium and potassium. What should you drink to get calcium? Milk is a
good source.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-lup}

-   Your body needs food to obtain energy, to get building blocks for
    your body, and to get substances that help control body processes.
-   Nutrients, chemicals in food that your body needs, include
    carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals.

**What nutrients are in this meal?**

There are many different nutrients that are present in this meal. For
example, the steak is a source of protein. The french fries are a source
of carbohydrates. Both these nutrients help supply the body with energy.

### Nutrients {#12.html#x-ck12-TnV0cmllbnRz_12-xmc}

Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids contain energy. When your body
digests food, it breaks down the molecules of these nutrients. This
releases the energy so your body can use it.

#### Carbohydrates {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9oeWRyYXRlcw.._12-3v7}

**Carbohydrates** are nutrients that include sugars, starches, and
fiber. There are two types of carbohydrates: simple and complex.
Pictured below are some foods that are good sources of carbohydrates (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wMi1DYXJib2h5ZHJhdGVz) ).

![Until the age of 13, you need about 130 grams of preferably complex
carbohydrates a
day](ck12_12_files/20150911113724387160.jpeg "Until the age of 13, you need about 130 grams of preferably complex carbohydrates a day")

**Figure 12.24**

Up to the age of 13 years, you need about 130 grams of carbohydrates a
day. Most of the carbohydrates should be complex. They are broken down
by the body more slowly than simple carbohydrates. Therefore, they
provide energy longer and more steadily.

</div>

#### Simple Carbohydrates {#12.html#x-ck12-U2ltcGxlIENhcmJvaHlkcmF0ZXM._12-cgb}

Sugars are small, simple carbohydrates that are found in foods such as
fruits and milk. The sugar found in fruits is called fructose. The sugar
found in milk is called lactose. These sugars are broken down by the
body to form glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ), the simplest sugar of all.

Where does glucose come from? Recall that glucose is the product of
photosynthesis, so some organisms such as plants are able to make their
own glucose. As animals cannot photosynthesize, they must eat to obtain
carbohydrates. Through the process of **cellular respiration** , glucose
is converted by cells into energy that is usable by the cell (ATP).

#### Complex Carbohydrates {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGxleCBDYXJib2h5ZHJhdGVz_12-ssa}

**Starch** is a large, complex carbohydrate made of thousands of glucose
units (monomers) joined together. Starches are found in foods such as
vegetables and grains. Starches are broken down by the body into sugars
that provide energy. Breads and pasta are good sources of complex
carbohydrates.

**Fiber** is another type of large, complex carbohydrate that is partly
indigestible. Unlike sugars and starches, fiber does not provide energy.
However, it has other important roles in the body. For example, fiber is
important for maintaining the health of your gastrointestinal tract.
Eating foods high in fiber also helps fill you up without providing too
many calories. Most fruits and vegetables are high in fiber. Some
examples are pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wMy1maWJlcg..) ).

diet](ck12_12_files/20150911113724678084.jpeg "Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet")

**Figure 12.25**

Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, girls need about 26 grams of fiber
per day, and boys need about 31 grams of fiber per day.

</div>

#### Proteins {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbnM._12-vwv}

**Proteins** are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called **amino
acids** . Recall that there are 20 different amino acids arranged like
"beads on a string" to form proteins. These amino acid chains then fold
up into a three-dimensional molecule, giving the protein a specific
function. Proteins have several important roles in the body. For
example, proteins make up antibodies, muscle fibers and enzymes that
help control cell and body processes. You need to make sure you have
enough protein in your diet to obtain the necessary amino acids to make
your proteins.

If you eat more than you need for these purposes, the extra protein is
used for energy. The image below shows how many grams of protein you
need each day ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wNC1wcm90ZWlucw..) ). It also shows
some foods that are good sources of protein.

**Figure 12.26**

Between the ages of 9 and 13 years, you need about 34 grams of proteins
a day. Seafood and eggs are other good sources of protein.

</div>

#### Lipids {#12.html#x-ck12-TGlwaWRz_12-tjz}

**Lipids** are nutrients, such as fats that store energy. Lipids also
have several other roles in the body. For example, lipids protect nerves
and make up the membranes that surround cells.

Fats are one type of lipid. Stored fat gives your body energy to use for
later. It’s like having money in a savings account: it’s there in case
you need it. Stored fat also cushions and protects internal organs. In
addition, it insulates the body. It helps keep you warm in cold weather.

There are two main types of fats, saturated and unsaturated.

1.  **Saturated fats** can be unhealthy, even in very small amounts.
    They are found mainly in animal foods, such as meats, whole milk,
    and eggs. So even though these foods are good sources of proteins,
    they should be eaten in limited amounts. Saturated lipids increase
    cholesterol levels in the blood. Too much cholesterol in the blood
    can lead to heart disease.
2.  **Unsaturated fats** are found mainly in plant foods, such as
    vegetable oil, olive oil, and nuts. Unsaturated lipids are also
    found in fish, such as salmon. Unsaturated lipids are needed in
    small amounts for good health. Most lipids in your diet should
    be unsaturated.

Another type of lipid is called **trans fat** . Trans fats are
manufactured and added to certain foods to keep them fresher for longer.
Foods that contain trans fats include cakes, cookies, fried foods, and
margarine. Eating foods that contain trans fats increases the risk of
heart disease.

Beginning with Denmark in 2003, many nations now limit the amount of
trans fat that can be in food products or ban these products all
together. On January 1, 2008, Calgary became the first city in Canada to
ban trans fats from restaurants and fast food chains. Beginning in 2010,
California banned trans fats from restaurant products, and in 2011, from
all retail baked goods.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-fdj}

-   Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids provide energy and have other
    important roles in the body.
-   Unsaturated fats are better for your health than trans fats or
    saturated fats.

**How do you get your vitamins?**

You may take a vitamin pill. That is a good way to make sure you are
getting most of the vitamins your body needs to grow. But the best way
to get your vitamins is through eating a healthy diet.

### Vitamins and Minerals {#12.html#x-ck12-Vml0YW1pbnMgYW5kIE1pbmVyYWxz_13-okq}

Vitamins and minerals are also nutrients. They do not provide energy,
but they are needed for good health.

#### Vitamins {#12.html#x-ck12-Vml0YW1pbnM._13-3dn}

**Vitamins** are organic compounds that the body needs in small amounts
to function properly. Humans need 13 different vitamins. Some of them
are listed below ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Vml0YW1pbnMtTmVlZGVkLUZvci1Hb29kLUhlYWx0aA..)
). The table also shows how much of each vitamin you need every day.
Vitamins have many roles in the body. For example, Vitamin A helps
maintain good vision. Vitamin B ~9~ helps form red blood cells. Vitamin
K is needed for blood to clot when you have a cut or other wound.

  **Vitamin**   **Necessary for**              **Available from**                                 **Daily Amount Required (at ages 9–13 years)**
  ------------- ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  A             Good vision                    Carrots, spinach, milk, eggs                       600 μg (1 μg = 1 × 10 ^-6^ g)
  B ~1~         Healthy nerves                 Whole wheat, peas, meat, beans, fish, peanuts      0.9 mg (1 mg = 1 × 10 ^-3^ g)
  B ~3~         Healthy skin and nerves        Beets, liver, pork, turkey, fish, peanuts          12 mg
  B ~9~         Red blood cells                Liver, peas, dried beans, leafy green vegetables   300 μg
  B ~12~        Healthy nerves                 Meat, liver, milk, shellfish, eggs                 1.8 μg
  C             Growth and repair of tissues   Oranges, grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli        45 mg
  D             Healthy bones and teeth        Milk, salmon, tuna, eggs                           5 μg
  K             Blood to clot                  Spinach, brussels sprouts, milk, eggs              60 μg

Some vitamins are produced in the body. For example, vitamin D is made
in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. Vitamins B ~12~ and K are
produced by bacteria that normally live inside the body. Most other
vitamins must come from foods. Foods that are good sources of vitamins
include whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and milk ( **Table**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Vml0YW1pbnMtTmVlZGVkLUZvci1Hb29kLUhlYWx0aA..)
).

Not getting enough vitamins can cause health problems. For example, too
little vitamin C causes a disease called scurvy. People with scurvy have
bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and other symptoms.

#### Minerals {#12.html#x-ck12-TWluZXJhbHM._13-h76}

**Minerals** are chemical elements that are needed for body processes.
Minerals that you need in relatively large amounts are listed below (
**Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TWluZXJhbHMtTmVlZGVkLUZvci1Hb29kLUhlYWx0aA..)
). Minerals that you need in smaller amounts include iodine, iron, and
zinc.

Minerals have many important roles in the body. For example, calcium and
phosphorus are needed for strong bones and teeth. Potassium and sodium
are needed for muscles and nerves to work normally.

  **Mineral**   **Necessary for**                           **Available from**                           **Daily Amount Required (at ages 9–13 years)**
  ------------- ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Calcium       Strong bones and teeth                      Milk, soy milk, leafy green vegetables       1,300 mg
  Chloride      Proper balance of water and salts in body   Table salt, most packaged foods              2.3 g
  Magnesium     Strong bones                                Whole grains, leafy green vegetables, nuts   240 mg
  Phosphorus    Strong bones and teeth                      Meat, poultry, whole grains                  1,250 mg
  Potassium     Muscles and nerves to work normally         Meats, grains, bananas, orange juice         4.5 g
  Sodium        Muscles and nerves to work normally         Table salt, most packaged foods              1.5 g

Your body cannot produce any of the minerals that it needs. Instead, you
must get minerals from the foods you eat. Good sources of minerals
include milk, leafy green vegetables, and whole grains ( **Table**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TWluZXJhbHMtTmVlZGVkLUZvci1Hb29kLUhlYWx0aA..)
).

Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, too
little calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which bones
become soft and break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also
cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added
to most packaged foods. People often add more sodium to their food by
using table salt. Too much sodium causes high blood pressure in some
people.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-49k}

    amounts for the body to function properly.

**Which foods would be the best choice?**

Each day you make many food choices. You decide which lunch line to get
into. Then you may choose an after-school snack. How can you make the
most healthy decisions?

### Choosing Healthy Foods {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hvb3NpbmcgSGVhbHRoeSBGb29kcw.._14-x2f}

Foods such as whole grain breads, fresh fruits, and fish provide
nutrients you need for good health. But different foods give you
different types of nutrients. You also need different amounts of each
nutrient. How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper
balance of nutrients? Three tools can help you choose foods wisely:
MyPyramid, MyPlate, and food labels.

#### MyPyramid {#12.html#x-ck12-TXlQeXJhbWlk_14-rdx}

**MyPyramid** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wNi1teS1weXJhbWlk) ) is a diagram
that shows how much you should eat each day of foods from six different
food groups. It recommends the amount of nutrients you need based on
your age, your gender, and your level of activity. The six food groups
in MyPyramid are:

-   Grains, such as bread, rice, pasta, and cereal.
-   Vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes.
-   Fruits, such as oranges, apples, bananas, and strawberries.
-   Oils, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil.
-   Dairy, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other cheeses.
-   Meat and beans, such as chicken, fish, soybeans, and kidney beans.

![MyPyramid can be used to help choose healthy
foods](ck12_12_files/20150911113725993146.png "MyPyramid can be used to help choose healthy foods")

**Figure 12.27**

MyPyramid can help you choose foods wisely for good health. Each colored
band represents a different food group. The key shows which food group
each color represents. Which colored band of MyPyramid is widest? Which
food group does it represent?

</div>

In MyPyramid, each food group is represented by a band of a different
color. For example, grains are represented by an orange band, and
vegetables are represented by a green band. The wider the band, the more
foods you should choose from that food group each day.

The orange band in MyPyramid is the widest band. This means that you
should choose more foods from the grain group than from any other single
food group. The green, blue, and red bands are also relatively wide.
Therefore, you should choose plenty of foods from the vegetable, dairy,
and fruit groups as well. You should choose the fewest foods from the
food group with the narrowest band. Which band is narrowest? Which food
group does it represent?

Are you wondering where foods like ice cream, cookies, and potato chips
fit into MyPyramid? The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods such as
these. These are foods that should be eaten only in very small amounts
and not very often. Such foods contain very few nutrients and are called
nutrient-poor. Instead, they are high in fats, sugars, and sodium, which
are nutrients that you should limit in a healthy eating plan. Ice cream,
cookies, and potato chips are also high in calories. Eating too much of
them may lead to unhealthy weight gain.

#### Healthy Eating Guidelines {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVhbHRoeSBFYXRpbmcgR3VpZGVsaW5lcw.._14-0xy}

-   Make at least half your daily grain choices whole grains. Examples
    of whole grains are whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and
    brown rice.
-   Choose a variety of different vegetables each day. Be sure to
    include both dark green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli,
    and orange vegetables, such as carrots and sweet potatoes.
-   Choose a variety of different fruits each day. Select mainly fresh
    fruits rather than canned fruits, and whole fruits instead of
    fruit juices.
-   When choosing oils, choose unsaturated oils, such as olive oil,
    canola oil, or vegetable oil.
-   Choose low-fat or fat-free milk and other dairy products. For
    example, select fat-free yogurt and low-fat cheese.
-   For meats, choose fish, chicken, and lean cuts of beef. Also, be
    sure to include beans, nuts, and seeds.

#### MyPlate {#12.html#x-ck12-TXlQbGF0ZQ.._14-dxh}

In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My
Pyramid with **MyPlate.** MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of
various food groups ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hvb3NlTXlQbGF0ZS5qcGc.) ). See
[http://www.choosemyplate.gov/]() for more information.

**Figure 12.28**

MyPlate is a visual guideline for balanced eating, replacing MyPyramid
in 2011.

</div>

The following guidelines accompany MyPlate:

1\. Balancing Calories

-   Enjoy your food, but eat less.
-   Avoid oversized portions.

2\. Foods to Increase

-   Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.
-   Make at least half your grains whole grains.
-   Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk.

3\. Foods to Reduce

-   Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals; choose
    the foods with lower levels.
-   Drink water instead of drinks with high levels of sugar.

#### Using Nutrition Facts Labels {#12.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgTnV0cml0aW9uIEZhY3RzIExhYmVscw.._14-e3d}

In the United States and other nations, packaged foods are required by
law to have nutrition facts labels. A **nutrition facts label** (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wNy1udXRyaXRpb24tZmFjdHMtbGFiZWw.) )
shows the nutrients in a food. Packaged foods are also required to list
their ingredients.

The information listed at the right of the label tells you what to look
for. At the top of the label, look for the serving size. The serving
size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients
listed on the label. A cup of food from the label pictured below is a
serving. The calories in one serving are listed next. In this food,
there are 250 calories per serving.

**Figure 12.29**

Reading nutrition facts labels can help you choose healthy foods. Look
at the nutrition facts label shown here. Do you think this food is a
good choice for a healthy eating plan? Why or why not?

</div>

Next on the nutrition facts label, look for the percent daily values (%
DV) of nutrients. Remember the following tips when reading a food label:

-   A food is low in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the
    nutrient is 5% or less.
-   The healthiest foods are low in nutrients such as fats and sodium.
-   A food is high in a nutrient if the percent daily value of the
    nutrient is 20% or more.
-   The healthiest foods are high in nutrients such as fiber
    and proteins.

Look at the percent daily values on the food label ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wNy1udXRyaXRpb24tZmFjdHMtbGFiZWw.) ).
Which nutrients have values of 5% or less? These are the nutrients that
are low in this food. They include fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and
iron. Which nutrients have values of 20% or more? These are the
nutrients that are high in this food. They include sodium, potassium,
and calcium.

#### Balancing Food with Exercise {#12.html#x-ck12-QmFsYW5jaW5nIEZvb2Qgd2l0aCBFeGVyY2lzZQ.._14-cdm}

Look at MyPyramid ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wNi1teS1weXJhbWlk) ). Note the person
walking up the side of the pyramid. This shows that exercise is
important for balanced eating. Exercise helps you use any extra energy
in the foods you eat. The more active you are, the more energy you use.
You should try to get at least an hour of physical activity just about
every day. Pictured below are some activities that can help you use
extra energy ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0wOS1jYWxvcmllcy1leGVyY2lzZQ..) ).

#### Weight Gain and Obesity {#12.html#x-ck12-V2VpZ2h0IEdhaW4gYW5kIE9iZXNpdHk._14-vom}

Any unused energy in food is stored in the body as fat. This is true
whether the extra energy comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids.
What happens if you take in more energy than you use, day after day? You
will store more and more fat and become overweight.

Eventually, you may become obese. **Obesity** is having a very high
percentage of body fat. Obese people are at least 20 percent heavier
than their healthy weight range. The excess body fat of obesity is
linked to many diseases. Obese people often have serious health
problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.
They are also more likely to develop arthritis and some types of cancer.
People who remain obese during their entire adulthood usually do not
live as long as people who stay within a healthy weight range.

The current generation of children and teens is the first generation in
our history that may have a shorter life than their parents. The reason
is their high rate of obesity and the health problems associated with
obesity. You can avoid gaining weight and becoming obese. The choice is
yours. Choose healthy foods by using MyPyramid and reading food labels.
Then get plenty of exercise to balance the energy in the foods you eat.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-mr3}

-   MyPlate, MyPyramid, and food labels are tools that can help you
    choose the best foods for healthy eating.
-   Eating too much and exercising too little can lead to weight gain
    and obesity.

**Do you know when you're digesting food?**

Unless you have an upset stomach, digestion usually happens without you
even noticing. You consciously chew up your food, but most of the
digestive process takes place without your conscious awareness. Long
after you put down your fork, food is still passing through your stomach
and small intestine. It may take over a day for a meal to pass all the
way through your digestive system.

### Function of the Digestive System {#12.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb24gb2YgdGhlIERpZ2VzdGl2ZSBTeXN0ZW0._15-vdi}

Nutrients in the foods you eat are needed by the cells of your body. How
do the nutrients in foods get to your body cells? What organs and
processes break down the foods and make the nutrients available to
cells? The organs are those of the digestive system. The processes are
digestion and absorption.

The **digestive system** is the body system that breaks down food and
absorbs nutrients. It also gets rid of solid food waste. The digestive
system is mainly one long tube from the mouth to the anus, known as the
gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). The main organs of the digestive
system include the esophagus, stomach and the intestine, and are
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xMC1kaWdlc3RpdmUtc3lzdGVt) ). The
intestine is divided into the small and large intestine. The small
intestine has three segments. The ileum is the longest segment of the
small intestine, which is well over 10 feet long. The large intestine is
about 5 feet long.

**Figure 12.31**

This drawing shows the major organs of the digestive system. The liver,
pancreas and gallbladder are also organs of the digestive system.

</div>

**Digestion** is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There
are two types of digestion, mechanical and chemical. In **mechanical
digestion** , large chunks of food are broken down into small pieces.
Mechanical digestion begins in the mouth and involves physical
processes, such as chewing. This process continues in the stomach as the
food is mixed with digestive juices. In **chemical digestion** , large
food molecules are broken down into small nutrient molecules. This is a
chemical process which also begins in the mouth as **saliva** begins to
break down food and continues in the stomach as stomach enzymes further
digest the food.

**Absorption** is the process that allows substances you eat to be taken
up by the blood. After food is broken down into small nutrient
molecules, the molecules are absorbed by the blood. After absorption,
the nutrient molecules travel in the bloodstream to cells throughout the
body. This happens mostly in the small intestine.

Some substances in food cannot be broken down into nutrients. They
remain behind in the digestive system after the nutrients are absorbed.
Any substances in food that cannot be digested and absorbed pass out of
the body as solid waste. The process of passing solid food waste out of
the body is called **elimination.**

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-ot4}

-   The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food,
    absorbs nutrients, and gets rid of solid wastes.

**What happens if you suck on a piece of white bread?**

If you kept a bite of white bread in your mouth for a long period of
time, it would start to get really mushy. Then it would start tasting
sweet. That's because you have enzymes in your saliva. The enzymes break
down the complex carbohydrates in the bread into simple sugars.

### The Role of Enzymes in the Digestive System {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJvbGUgb2YgRW56eW1lcyBpbiB0aGUgRGlnZXN0aXZlIFN5c3RlbQ.._16-o2k}

Chemical digestion could not take place without the help of digestive
enzymes. An **enzyme** is a protein that speeds up chemical reactions in
the body. Digestive enzymes speed up chemical reactions that break down
large food molecules into small molecules.

Did you ever use a wrench to tighten a bolt? You could tighten a bolt
with your fingers, but it would be difficult and slow. If you use a
wrench, you can tighten a bolt much more easily and quickly. Enzymes are
like wrenches. They make it much easier and quicker for chemical
reactions to take place. Like a wrench, enzymes can also be used over
and over again. But you need the appropriate size and shape of the
wrench to efficiently tighten the bolt, just like each enzyme is
specific for the reaction it helps.

Digestive enzymes are released, or secreted, by the organs of the
digestive system. These enzymes include proteases that digest proteins,
and nucleases that digest nucleic acids. Examples of digestive enzymes
are:

-   Amylase, produced in the mouth. It helps break down large starch
    molecules into smaller sugar molecules.
-   Pepsin, produced in the stomach. Pepsin helps break down proteins
    into amino acids.
-   Trypsin, produced in the pancreas. Trypsin also breaks
    down proteins.
-   Pancreatic lipase, produced in the pancreas. It is used to break
    apart fats.
-   Deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, produced in the pancreas. They
    are enzymes that break bonds in nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.

Bile salts are bile acids that help to break down fat. Bile acids are
made in the liver. When you eat a meal, bile is secreted into the
intestine, where it breaks down the fats ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfYmlsZQ..) ).

#### Hormones and Digestion {#12.html#x-ck12-SG9ybW9uZXMgYW5kIERpZ2VzdGlvbg.._16-zyd}

If you are a typical teenager, you like to eat. For your body to break
down, absorb and spread the nutrients from your food throughout your
body, your digestive system and **endocrine system** need to work
together. The endocrine system sends **hormones** around your body to
communicate between cells. Essentially, hormones are chemical messenger
molecules.

Digestive hormones are made by cells lining the stomach and small
intestine. These hormones cross into the blood where they can affect
other parts of the digestive system. Some of these hormones are listed
below.

-   Gastrin, which signals the secretion of gastric acid.
-   Cholecystokinin, which signals the secretion of pancreatic enzymes.
-   Secretin, which signals secretion of water and bicarbonate from
    the pancreas.
-   Ghrelin, which signals when you are hungry.
-   Gastric inhibitory polypeptide, which stops or decreases
    gastric secretion. It also causes the release of insulin in response
    to high blood glucose levels.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-pah}

-   Digestive enzymes speed up the reactions of chemical digestion.
-   Hormones, chemical messengers used to communicate between cells, are
    important in regulating digestion.

**How many organs of the digestive system can you name?**

Stomach? Mouth? It takes many different organs working together in order
to digest your food. Some are part of the pipeline that food passes
through. Others make special chemicals that are needed for digestion.

### Organs of the Digestive System {#12.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5zIG9mIHRoZSBEaWdlc3RpdmUgU3lzdGVt_17-xhr}

The mouth and stomach are just two of the organs of the digestive
system. Other digestive system organs are the esophagus, small
intestine, and large intestine. Below, you can see that the digestive
organs form a long tube ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xMi1saXZlci1nYWxsLXBhbmNyZWFz) ). In
adults, this tube is about 30 feet long! At one end of the tube is the
mouth. At the other end is the anus. Food enters the mouth and then
passes through the rest of the digestive system. Food waste leaves the
body through the anus.

**Figure 12.33**

This drawing shows the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. These organs
are part of the digestive system. Food does not pass through them, but
they secrete substances needed for chemical digestion.

</div>

The organs of the digestive system are lined with muscles. The muscles
contract, or tighten, to push food through the system ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xMS1wZXJpc3RhbHNpcw..) ). The muscles
contract in waves. The waves pass through the digestive system like
waves through a slinky. This movement of muscle contractions is called
**peristalsis** . Without peristalsis, food would not be able to move
through the digestive system. Peristalsis is an involuntary process,
which means that it occurs without your conscious control.

This diagram shows how muscles push food through the digestive system.
Muscle contractions travel through the system in waves, pushing the food

The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are also organs of the digestive
system ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xMi1saXZlci1nYWxsLXBhbmNyZWFz) ).
Food does not pass through these three organs. However, these organs are
important for digestion. They secrete or store enzymes or other
chemicals that are needed to help digest food chemically.

#### Mouth, Esophagus, and Stomach {#12.html#x-ck12-TW91dGgsIEVzb3BoYWd1cywgYW5kIFN0b21hY2g._17-wio}

The mouth is the first organ that food enters. But digestion may start
even before you put the first bite of food into your mouth. Just seeing
or smelling food can cause the release of saliva and digestive enzymes
in your mouth.

Once you start eating, saliva wets the food, which makes it easier to
break up and swallow. Digestive enzymes, including the enzyme amylase,
start breaking down starches into sugars. Your tongue helps mix the food
with the saliva and enzymes.

Your teeth also help digest food. Your front teeth are sharp. They cut
and tear food when you bite into it. Your back teeth are broad and flat.
They grind food into smaller pieces when you chew. Chewing is part of
mechanical digestion. Your tongue pushes the food to the back of your
mouth so you can swallow it. When you swallow, the lump of chewed food
passes down your throat to your esophagus.

The **esophagus** is a narrow tube that carries food from the throat to
the stomach. Food moves through the esophagus because of peristalsis. At
the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle controls the opening
to the stomach. The muscle relaxes to let food pass into the stomach.
Then the muscle contracts again to prevent food from passing back into
the esophagus.

Some people think that gravity moves food through the esophagus. If that
were true, food would move through the esophagus only when you are
sitting or standing upright. In fact, because of peristalsis, food can
move through the esophagus no matter what position you are in—even
upside down! Just don’t try to swallow food when you are upside down—you
could choke!

The **stomach** is a sac-like organ at the end of the esophagus. It has
thick muscular walls. The muscles contract and relax. This moves the
food around and helps break it into smaller pieces. Mixing the food
around with the enzyme pepsin and other chemicals helps digest proteins.

Water, salt, and simple sugars can be absorbed into the blood from the
stomach. Most other substances are broken down further in the small
intestine before they are absorbed. The stomach stores food until the
small intestine is ready to receive it. A circular muscle controls the
opening between the stomach and small intestine. When the small
intestine is empty, the muscle relaxes. This lets food pass from the
stomach into the small intestine.

#### Small Intestine {#12.html#x-ck12-U21hbGwgSW50ZXN0aW5l_17-mqs}

The **small intestine** a is narrow tube that starts at the stomach and
ends at the large intestine ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xMi1saXZlci1nYWxsLXBhbmNyZWFz) ). In
adults, the small intestine is about 23 feet long. Chemical digestion
takes place in the first part of the small intestine. Many enzymes and
other chemicals are secreted here. The small intestine is also where
most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. The later sections of the
small intestines are covered with tiny projections called **villi** (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfdmlsbGk.) ). Villi contain
very tiny blood vessels. Nutrients are absorbed into the blood through
these tiny vessels. There are millions of villi, so, altogether, there
is a very large area for absorption to take place. In fact, villi make
the inner surface area of the small intestine 1,000 times larger than it
would be without them. The entire inner surface area of the small
intestine is about as big as a basketball court!

This is what the villi lining the intestine looks like when magnified.
Each one is actually only about 1 millimeter long. Villi are just barely
visible with the unaided eye.

The small intestine is much longer than the large intestine. So why is
it called “small”? If you compare small and large intestines (
**Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xMi1saXZlci1nYWxsLXBhbmNyZWFz) ), you
will see the small intestine is smaller in width than the large
intestine.

#### Large Intestine {#12.html#x-ck12-TGFyZ2UgSW50ZXN0aW5l_17-u3w}

The **large intestine** is a wide tube that connects the small intestine
with the anus. In adults, it is about five feet long. Waste enters the
large intestine from the small intestine in a liquid state. As the waste
moves through the large intestine, excess water is absorbed from it.
After the excess water is absorbed, the remaining solid waste is called
feces.

Circular muscles control the anus. They relax to let the feces pass out
of the body through the anus. After feces pass out of the body, they are
called stool. Releasing the stool from the body is referred to as a
bowel movement.

**Why eat yogurt?**

Yogurt is a good source of calcium. Yogurt also contains active cultures
of "good" bacteria. Foods that contain these beneficial bacteria are
sometimes called "probiotic."

### Bacteria in the Digestive System {#12.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWEgaW4gdGhlIERpZ2VzdGl2ZSBTeXN0ZW0._18-356}

Your large intestine is not just made up of cells. It is also an
**ecosystem** , home to trillions of bacteria known as the "gut flora" (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZ3V0YmFjdGVyaWE.) ). But
don't worry, most of these bacteria are helpful. Friendly bacteria live
mostly in the large intestine and part of the small intestine. The
acidic environment of the stomach does not allow bacterial growth.

Gut bacteria have several roles in the body. For example, intestinal
bacteria:

-   Produce **vitamin B ~12~** and **vitamin K** .
-   Control the growth of harmful bacteria.
-   Break down poisons in the large intestine.
-   Break down some substances in food that cannot be digested, such as
    fiber and some starches and sugars. Bacteria produce enzymes that
    digest carbohydrates in plant cell walls. Most of the nutritional
    value of plant material would be wasted without these bacteria.
    These help us digest plant foods like spinach.

**Figure 12.36**

Your intestines are home to trillions of bacteria.

</div>

A wide range of friendly bacteria live in the gut. Bacteria begin to
populate the human digestive system right after birth. Gut bacteria
include *Lactobacillus* , the bacteria commonly used in probiotic foods
such as yogurt, and *E. coli* bacteria. About a third of all bacteria in
the gut are members of the *Bacteroides* species. *Bacteroides* are key
in helping us digest plant food.

It is estimated that 100 trillion bacteria live in the gut. This is more
than the human cells that make up you. It has also been estimated that
there are more bacteria in your mouth than people on the planet. There
are over 7 billion people on the planet.

The bacteria in your digestive system are from anywhere between 300 and
1000 species. As these bacteria are helpful, your body does not attack
them. They actually appear to the body's immune system as cells of the
digestive system, not foreign invaders. The bacteria actually cover
themselves with sugar molecules removed from the actual cells of the
digestive system. This disguises the bacteria and protects them from the
immune system.

As the bacteria that live in the human gut are beneficial to us, and as
the bacteria enjoy a safe environment to live, the relationship that we
have with these tiny organisms is described as mutualism, a type of
symbiotic relationship.

Lastly, keep in mind the small size of bacteria. Together, all the
bacteria in your gut may weight just about 2 pounds.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-kat}

-   Your large intestine is home to trillions of bacteria.
-   Bacteria in the large intestine have important roles, such as
    producing vitamins and controlling the growth of harmful bacteria.

**Have you ever been sick to your stomach?**

You may have even had to stay home from school because of a "stomach
bug." It is possible that you caught a contagious illness, or you could
have gotten sick from food you had eaten recently. The symptoms are very
similar, so it's hard to pinpoint the cause.

### Health of the Digestive System {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVhbHRoIG9mIHRoZSBEaWdlc3RpdmUgU3lzdGVt_19-wvo}

Most of the time, you probably aren’t aware of your digestive system. It
works well without causing any problems. But most people have problems
with their digestive system at least once in a while. Did you ever eat
something that didn’t “agree” with you? Maybe you had a stomachache or
felt sick to your stomach? Maybe you had diarrhea? These could be
symptoms of foodborne illness, food allergies, or a food intolerance.

#### Foodborne Illness {#12.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZGJvcm5lIElsbG5lc3M._19-xbc}

Harmful bacteria can enter your digestive system in food and make you
sick. This is called **foodborne illness** or food poisoning. The
bacteria, or the toxins they produce, may cause vomiting or cramping, in
addition to the symptoms mentioned above. Foodborne illnesses can also
be caused by viruses and parasites. The most common foodborne illnesses
happen within a few minutes to a few hours, and make you feel really
sick, but last for only about a day or so. Others can take longer for
the illness to appear. Some people believe that the taste of food will
tell you if it is bad. As a rule, you probably should not eat bad
tasting food, but many contaminated foods can still taste good.

You can help prevent foodborne illness by following a few simple rules.

-   Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. This helps prevent any
    bacteria in the foods from multiplying.
-   Wash your hands before you prepare or eat food. This helps prevent
    bacteria on your hands from getting on the food. This is the easiest
    way to prevent foodborne illnesses.
-   Wash your hands after you touch raw foods, such as meats, poultry,
    fish, or eggs. These foods often contain bacteria that your hands
    could transfer to your mouth.
-   Cook meats, poultry, fish, and eggs thoroughly before eating them.
    The heat of cooking kills any bacteria the foods may contain, so
    they cannot make you sick.
-   Refrigerate cooked food soon after a meal. Cooked food can be left
    out for up to two hours before they need to be placed in the cold.
    This will prevent the spread of bacteria. Cooked foods should not be
    left out all day.

Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses include *Salmonella* , a
bacterium found in many foods, including raw and undercooked meat,
poultry, dairy products, and seafood. *Campylobacter jejuni* is found in
raw or undercooked chicken and unpasteurized milk. Several strains of
*E. coli* can cause illnesses, and are found in raw or undercooked
hamburger, unpasteurized fruit juices and milk, and even fresh produce.
*Vibrio* is a bacterium that may contaminate fish or shellfish.
*Listeria* has been found in raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized
milk, soft cheeses, and ready-to-eat deli meats and hot dogs. Most of
these bacterial illnesses can be prevented with proper cooking of food
and washing of hands.

Common foodborne viruses include norovirus and hepatitis A virus.
Norovirus, which causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines, has
been a recent issue on cruise ships, infecting hundreds of passengers
and crew on certain voyages. Hepatitis A causes inflammation of the
liver, which is treated with rest and diet changes. Parasites are tiny
organisms that live inside another organism. *Giardia* is a parasite
spread through water contaminated with the stools of people or animals
who are infected. Food preparers who are infected with parasites can
also contaminate food if they do not thoroughly wash their hands after
using the bathroom and before handling food. *Trichinella* is a type of
roundworm parasite. People may be infected with this parasite by
consuming raw or undercooked pork or wild game.

#### Food Allergies {#12.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBBbGxlcmdpZXM._19-krq}

**Food allergies** are like other allergies. They occur when the immune
system reacts to harmless substances as though they were harmful. Almost
ten percent of children have food allergies. Some of the foods most
likely to cause allergies are shown below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNy0xNC1mb29kLWFsbGVyZ2llcw..) ).

Eating foods you are allergic to may cause vomiting, diarrhea, or skin
rashes. Some people are very allergic to certain foods. Eating even tiny
amounts of the foods causes them to have serious symptoms, such as
difficulty breathing. If they eat the foods by accident, they may need
emergency medical treatment.

**Figure 12.37**

Some of the foods that commonly cause allergies are shown here. They
include nuts, eggs, grains, milk, and shellfish. Are you allergic to any
of these foods?

</div>

The most common food allergy symptoms include:

-   tingling or itching in the mouth
-   hives, itching or eczema,
-   swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other parts of the
    body,
-   wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing,
-   abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting,
-   dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting.

In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction
called anaphylaxis. Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis.
Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or death. Anaphylaxis is vary
rare. The vast majority of people will never have an anaphylactic
reaction. The life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

-   constriction and tightening of the airway,
-   a swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that
    makes it difficult to breathe,
-   shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure,
-   a rapid pulse,
-   dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.

#### Food Intolerance {#12.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBJbnRvbGVyYW5jZQ.._19-ei3}

A **food intolerance** , or food sensitivity, is different from a food
allergy. A food intolerance happens when the digestive system is unable
to break down a certain type of food. This can result in stomach
cramping, diarrhea, tiredness, and weight loss. Food intolerances are
often mistakenly called allergies. Lactose intolerance is a food
intolerance. A person who is lactose intolerant does not make enough
lactase, the enzyme that breaks down the milk sugar, lactose. Lactose
intolerance may be as high as 75% in some populations, but overall the
percentage of affected individuals is much less. Still, well over 10% of
the world's population is lactose intolerant.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-lha}

-   Foodborne illness can be prevented by taking precautions during
    food preparation.
-   Food allergies and food intolerance can upset your digestive system.

**What do you do for "cardio"?**

"Cardio" has become slang for aerobic exercise that raises your heart
rate for an extended amount of time. Cardio can include biking, running,
or swimming. Can you guess one of the main organs of the cardiovascular
system? Yes, your heart.

### Functions of the Cardiovascular System {#12.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIHRoZSBDYXJkaW92YXNjdWxhciBTeXN0ZW0._20-7lk}

Your cardiovascular system has many jobs. At times the cardiovascular
system can work like a pump, a heating system, or even a postal carrier.
To do these tasks, your cardiovascular system works with other organ
systems, such as the respiratory, endocrine, and nervous systems.

The **cardiovascular system** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfY2lyY3VsYXRpb24.) ) is made up of the
heart, the blood vessels, and the blood. It moves nutrients, gases (like
oxygen), and wastes to and from your cells. Every cell in your body
depends on your cardiovascular system. If your cells don't receive
nutrients, they cannot survive. The main function of the cardiovascular
system is to deliver oxygen to each of your cells. Blood receives oxygen
in your lungs (the main organs of the respiratory system) and then is
pumped, by your heart, throughout your body. The oxygen then diffuses
into your cells, and carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular
respiration, moves from your cells into your blood to be delivered back
to your lungs and exhaled. Each cell in your body needs oxygen, as
oxygen is used in cellular respiration to produce energy in the form of
ATP. Without oxygen, lactic acid fermentation would occur in your cells,
which can only be maintained for a brief period of time. Arteries carry
blood full of oxygen ("oxygen-rich") away from the heart and veins
return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.

The cardiovascular system also plays a role in maintaining body
temperature. It helps to keep you warm by moving warm blood around your
body. Your blood vessels also control your body temperature to keep you
from getting too hot or too cold. When your brain senses that your body
temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the
skin to increase in diameter. Increasing the diameter of the blood
vessels increases the amount of blood and heat that moves near the
skin's surface. The heat is then released from the skin. This helps you
cool down. What do you think your blood vessels do when your body
temperature is decreasing?

The blood also carries hormones, which are chemical messenger molecules
produced by organs of the endocrine system, through your body. Hormones
are produced in one area of your body and have an effect on another
area. To get to that other area, they must travel through your blood. An
example is the hormone adrenaline, produced by the adrenal glands on top
of the kidneys. Adrenaline has multiple effects on the heart (it
quickens the heart rate), on muscles and on the airway.

**Are your blood vessels leaky?**

None of your blood vessels are leaking this badly, or you'd be in the
hospital! But your blood vessels do leak a little bit. Water and solutes
pass out of the blood vessels and help form the fluid that bathes your
body's tissues. Ultimately the fluid that is lost from the blood vessels
is returned through the lymphatic system.

### The Lymphatic System and Circulation {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEx5bXBoYXRpYyBTeXN0ZW0gYW5kIENpcmN1bGF0aW9u_21-7lu}

The **lymphatic system** is a network of vessels and tissues that carry
a clear fluid called **lymph.** The lymphatic system ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0wNy1seW1waGF0aWMtc3lzdGVt) ) spreads
all around the body and filters and cleans the lymph of any debris,
abnormal cells, or pathogens. **Lymph vessels** are tube-shaped, just
like blood vessels, with about 500-600 lymph nodes (in an adult)
attached. The lymphatic system works with the cardiovascular system to
return body fluids to the blood. The lymphatic system and the
cardiovascular system are often called the body’s two "circulatory
systems."

Organs of the lymphatic system include the tonsils, thymus gland and
spleen. The thymus gland produces T cells or T-lymphocytes (see below)
and the spleen and tonsils help in fighting infections. The spleen’s
main function is to filter the blood. The spleen also detects viruses
and bacteria and triggers the release of pathogen fighting cells.

The lymphatic system helps return fluid that leaks from the blood
vessels back to the cardiovascular system.

#### Role of the Lymphatic System in Circulation {#12.html#x-ck12-Um9sZSBvZiB0aGUgTHltcGhhdGljIFN5c3RlbSBpbiBDaXJjdWxhdGlvbg.._21-vum}

You may think that your blood vessels have thick walls without any
leaks, but that's not true. Blood vessels can leak just like any other
pipe. The lymphatic system makes sure leaked blood returns back to the
bloodstream.

When a small amount of fluid leaks out from the blood vessels, it
collects in the spaces between cells and tissues. Some of the fluid
returns to the cardiovascular system, and the rest is collected by the
lymph vessels of the lymphatic system ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0wOC1seW1waC1jYXBpbGxhcmllcw..) ). The
fluid that collects in the lymph vessels is called lymph. The lymphatic
system then returns the lymph to the cardiovascular system. Unlike the
cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed (meaning it is
an open circulatory system that releases and collects fluid) and has no
central pump (or heart). Lymph moves slowly in lymph vessels. It is
moved along in the lymph vessels by the squeezing action of smooth
muscles and skeletal muscles.

The lymphatic system also plays an important role in the immune system.
For example, the lymphatic system makes white blood cells that protect
the body from diseases. Cells of the lymphatic system produce two types
of white blood cells, T cells and B cells, that are involved in fighting
specific pathogens. Lymph nodes, which are scattered throughout the
lymphatic system, act as filters or traps for foreign particles and are
important in the proper functioning of the immune system. The role of
the lymphatic system in the immune response is discussed in additional
concepts.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-tzo}

    body fluids to the blood.

**Where is your heart?**

Place your hand on your heart. Did you put your hand on the left side of
your chest? Most people do, but the heart is actually located closer to
the center of the chest.

### The Heart {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEhlYXJ0_22-fob}

What does the heart look like? How does it pump blood? The heart is
divided into four chambers ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xMS1hdHJpYS12ZW50cmljbGVz) ), or
spaces: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. An
**atrium** (singular for atria) is one of the two small, thin-walled
chambers on the top of the heart where the blood first enters. A
**ventricle** is one of the two muscular V-shaped chambers that pump
blood out of the heart. You can remember they are called ventricles
because they are shaped like a "V."

**Figure 12.41**

The atria receive blood and the ventricles pump blood out of the heart.

</div>

The atria receive the blood, and the ventricles pump the blood out of
the heart. Each of the four chambers of the heart has a specific job.

-   The right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body.
-   The right ventricle pumps oxygen-poor blood toward the lungs, where
    it receives oxygen.
-   The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.
-   The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood out of the heart to the
    rest of the body.

#### Blood Flow Through the Heart {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgRmxvdyBUaHJvdWdoIHRoZSBIZWFydA.._22-rul}

Blood flows through the heart in two separate loops. You can think of
them as a “left side loop” and a “right side loop.” The right side of
the heart collects oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it into the
lungs, where it releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The left
side carries the oxygen-rich blood back from the lungs into the left
side of the heart, which then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of
the body. The blood delivers oxygen to the cells of the body and returns
to the heart oxygen-poor.

To move blood through the heart, the cardiac muscle needs to contract in
an organized way. Blood first enters the atria ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xMi1oZWFydC1ibG9vZC1mbG93) ). When
the atria contract, blood is pushed into the ventricles. After the
ventricles fill with blood, they contract, and blood is pushed out of
the heart. The heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscle. These muscle
cells contract in unison, causing the heart itself to contract and
generating enough force to push the blood out.

So how is the blood kept from flowing back on itself? **Valves** (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xMi1oZWFydC1ibG9vZC1mbG93)
) in the heart keep the blood flowing in one direction. The valves do
this by opening and closing in one direction only. Blood only moves
forward through the heart. The valves stop the blood from flowing
backward. There are four valves of the heart.

-   The two atrioventricular (AV) valves stop blood from moving from the
    ventricles to the atria.
-   The two semilunar (SL) valves are found in the arteries leaving the
    heart, and they prevent blood from flowing back from the arteries
    into the ventricles.

Why does a heart beat? The “lub-dub” sound of the heartbeat is caused by
the closing of the AV valves ("lub") and SL valves ("dub") after blood
has passed through them.

Blood flows in only one direction in the heart. Blood enters the atria,
which contract and push blood into the ventricles. The atria relax and
the ventricles fill with blood. Finally, the ventricles contract and
push blood around the body.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-flb}

    ventricles, which contract and push blood around the body.

**Why are these arteries so important?**

The major arteries of the neck are shown here in red. The heart pumps
oxygen-rich blood through these arteries to the brain. Without oxygen,
the brain cannot survive longer than just a few minutes. So these
arteries in the neck are very important.

### Blood Vessels and Blood Circulation {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgVmVzc2VscyBhbmQgQmxvb2QgQ2lyY3VsYXRpb24._23-km8}

The blood vessels are an important part of the cardiovascular system.
They connect the heart to every cell in the body. **Arteries** carry
blood away from the heart, while **veins** return blood to the heart (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xMy1oZWFydC1ibG9vZC12ZXNzZWxz) ).

**Figure 12.43**

The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood into pulmonary
circulation, while the left side pumps oxygenated blood into systemic
circulation.

</div>

#### Important Arteries and Veins {#12.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW50IEFydGVyaWVzIGFuZCBWZWlucw.._23-vza}

There are specific veins and arteries that are more significant than
others. The **pulmonary arteries** carry oxygen-poor blood away from the
heart to the lungs. These are the only arteries that carry oxygen-poor
blood. The **aorta** is the largest artery in the body. It carries
oxygen-rich blood away from the heart.

Further away from the heart, the aorta branches into smaller arteries,
which eventually branch into capillaries. **Capillaries** are the
smallest type of blood vessel; they connect very small arteries and
veins. Gases and other substances are exchanged between cells and the
blood across the very thin walls of capillaries.

The veins that return oxygen-poor blood to the heart are the **superior
vena cava** and the **inferior vena cava** . The **pulmonary veins**
return oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. The pulmonary
veins are the only veins that carry oxygen-rich blood.

#### Pulmonary Circulation {#12.html#x-ck12-UHVsbW9uYXJ5IENpcmN1bGF0aW9u_23-bn2}

**Pulmonary circulation** is the part of the cardiovascular system that
carries oxygen-poor blood away from the heart and brings it to the
lungs. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart from the body and leaves
the right ventricle through the pulmonary arteries, which carry the
blood to each lung. Once at the lungs, the red blood cells release
carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen when you breathe. The oxygen-rich
blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins, which return it
to the left side of the heart. This completes the pulmonary cycle. The
oxygenated blood is then pumped to the body through systemic
circulation, before returning again to pulmonary circulation.

#### Systemic Circulation {#12.html#x-ck12-U3lzdGVtaWMgQ2lyY3VsYXRpb24._23-q57}

**Systemic circulation** is the part of the cardiovascular system that
carries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, to the body, and returns
oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left
ventricle through the aorta. Then it travels to the body's organs and
tissues. The tissues and organs absorb the oxygen through the
capillaries. Oxygen-poor blood is collected from the tissues and organs
by tiny veins, which then flow into bigger veins, and, eventually, into
the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava. This completes systemic
circulation. The blood releases carbon dioxide and gets more oxygen in
pulmonary circulation before returning to systemic circulation. The
inferior vena cava returns blood from the body. The superior vena cava
returns blood from the head.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._23-6eu}

-   Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins return blood
    to the heart.
-   Pulmonary circulation carries blood between the heart and lungs,

**What's in your blood?**

These bags of blood will be stored until they are needed for a
transfusion. But what exactly is blood? What makes up the blood? Most of
your blood is water. However, there are also many other important
components of your blood.

### Components of Blood {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG9uZW50cyBvZiBCbG9vZA.._24-khj}

Did you know that blood is a tissue? Blood is a fluid connective tissue
that is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and
plasma. The cells that make up blood are pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xNC1TRU0tYmxvb2QtY2VsbHM.) ). The
different parts of blood have different roles.

#### Plasma {#12.html#x-ck12-UGxhc21h_24-emx}

If you were to filter out all the cells in blood, a golden-yellow liquid
would be left behind. **Plasma** is this fluid part of the blood. Plasma
is about 90% water and about 10% dissolved proteins, glucose, ions,
hormones, and gases. Blood is made up mostly of plasma.

#### Red Blood Cells {#12.html#x-ck12-UmVkIEJsb29kIENlbGxz_24-n5f}

**Red blood cells** (RBCs) are flattened, disk-shaped cells that carry
oxygen. They are the most common blood cell in the blood. There are
about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood. Each RBC has
about 200 million molecules of hemoglobin. **Hemoglobin** is the protein
that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red
color.

Red blood cells ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xNS1yZWQtYmxvb2QtY2VsbC1zaGFwZQ..) )
are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and
vertebrae. Each red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four
months). After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen.
Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles.
Lacking these components allows the cells to have more hemoglobin and
carry more oxygen.

#### White Blood Cells {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hpdGUgQmxvb2QgQ2VsbHM._24-gtg}

**White blood cells** (WBCs) are usually larger than red blood cells.
They do not have hemoglobin and do not carry oxygen. White blood cells
make up less than one percent of the blood's volume. Most WBCs are made
in the bone marrow, and some mature in the lymphatic system. There are
different WBCs with different jobs. WBCs defend the body against
infection by bacteria, viruses, and other **pathogens** . WBCs do have a
nucleus and other organelles.

-   Neutrophils are WBCs that can squeeze through capillary walls and
    swallow particles such as bacteria and parasites.
-   Macrophages are large WBCs that can also swallow and destroy old and
    dying cells, bacteria, or viruses. Below, a macrophage is attacking
    and swallowing two particles, possibly disease-causing pathogens (
    **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xNi1tYWNyb3BoYWdlLWFuZC1jYW5jZXItY2VsbA..) ).
    Macrophages also release chemical messages that cause the number of
    WBCs to increase.
-   Lymphocytes are WBCs that fight infections caused by viruses
    and bacteria. Some lymphocytes attack and kill cancer cells.
    Lymphocytes called B-cells make antibodies.

#### Platelets {#12.html#x-ck12-UGxhdGVsZXRz_24-a3x}

**Platelets** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xNy1wbGF0ZWxldC1SQkMtV0JD) ) are very
small, but they are very important in blood clotting. Platelets are not
cells. They are sticky little pieces of larger cells. Platelets bud off
large cells that stay in the bone marrow. When a blood vessel gets cut,
platelets stick to the injured areas. They release chemicals called
clotting factors, which cause proteins to form over the wound. This web
of proteins catches red blood cells and forms a clot. This clot stops
more blood from leaving the body through the cut blood vessel. The clot
also stops bacteria from entering the body. Platelets survive in the
blood for ten days before they are removed by the liver and spleen.

**What's your type?**

As this woman donates blood, you can see her blood collecting in a
special bag. This bag is coded with her blood type. That makes it
possible for doctors and nurses to match up the blood she is giving to a
recipient that has the same blood type.

### Blood Types {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgVHlwZXM._25-wfp}

Do you know what your blood type is? Maybe you have heard people say
that they have type A or type O blood. Blood type is a way to describe
the type of **antigens** , or proteins, on the surface of red blood
cells (RBCs). There are four blood types; A, B, AB, and O.

1.  Type A blood has type A antigens on the RBCs in the blood.
2.  Type AB blood has A and B antigens on the RBCs.
3.  Type B has B antigens on the RBCs.
4.  Type O does not have either A or B antigens.

The ABO blood group system is important if a person needs a blood
transfusion. A **blood transfusion** is the process of putting blood or
blood products from one person into the circulatory system of another
person. The blood type of the recipient needs to be carefully matched to
the blood type of the donor. That's because different blood types have
different types of antibodies, or proteins, released by the blood cells.
Antibodies attack strange substances in the body. This is a normal part
of your immune response, which is your defense against disease.

For example, imagine a person with type O blood was given type A blood.
First, what type of antibodies do people with type O blood produce? They
produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies. This means, if a person with type
O blood received type A blood, the anti-A antibodies in the person’s
blood would attack the A antigens on the RBCs in the donor blood (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xOC1ibG9vZC1hdHRhY2stYW50aWdlbnM.) ).
The antibodies would cause the RBCs to clump together, and the clumps
could block a blood vessel. This clumping of blood cells could cause
death.

**Figure 12.48**

A person with type O blood has A and B antibodies in his/her plasma; if
the person was to get type A blood instead of type O, his/her A
antibodies would attach to the antigens on the RBCs and cause them to
clump together.

</div>

People with type A blood produce anti-B antibodies, and people with type
B blood produce anti-A antibodies. People with type AB blood do not
produce either antibody.

#### The Rhesus Factor {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJoZXN1cyBGYWN0b3I._25-vti}

The second most important blood group system in human blood is the
**Rhesus (Rh) factor** . A person either has, or does not have, the Rh
antigen on the surface of their RBCs. If they do have it, then the
person is positive. If the person does not have the antigen, they are
considered negative.

#### Blood Donors {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgRG9ub3Jz_25-5ji}

Recall that people with type O blood do not have any antigens on their
RBCs. As a result, type O blood can be given to people with blood types
A, B, or AB. If there are no antigens on the RBCs, there cannot be an
antibody reaction in the blood. People with type O blood are often
called **universal donors** .

The blood plasma of AB blood does not contain any anti-A or anti-B
antibodies. People with type AB blood can receive any ABO blood type.
People with type AB blood are called **universal recipients** because
they can receive any blood type. The antigens and antibodies that define
blood type are listed as follows ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Qmxvb2RUeXBlc0FudGlnZW5zQW50aWJvZGllcw..)
).

  **Blood Type**   **Antigen Type**   **Plasma Antibodies**   **Can Receive Blood from Types**   **Can Donate Blood to Types**

**What do these foods have in common?**

Red meat, legumes, and spinach are all good sources of iron. Getting
enough iron in your diet is important to prevent anemia. Anemia is a
blood disease that causes you to feel weak and tired. Although anemia is
caused by a nutrient deficiency, other blood diseases are genetic
diseases, or forms of cancer.

### Blood Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgRGlzZWFzZXM._26-ggm}

Problems can occur with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets,
and other parts of the blood. Many blood disorders are genetic, meaning
they are inherited from a parent. Some blood diseases are caused by not
getting enough of a certain nutrient, while others are cancers of the
blood.

#### Anemia {#12.html#x-ck12-QW5lbWlh_26-3qh}

**Anemia** is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin
in the blood to carry oxygen to body cells. **Hemoglobin** is the blood
protein that normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.
Anemia leads to a lack of oxygen in organs.

Anemia is usually caused by one of the following:

-   A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood.
-   The destruction of red blood cells.
-   A lack of red blood cell production.

Anemia may not have any symptoms. Some people with anemia feel weak or
tired in general or during exercise. They also may have poor
concentration. People with more severe anemia often get short of breath
during times of activity. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type
of anemia. It occurs when the body does not receive enough iron. Since
there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen,
cannot function properly.

In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have
iron-deficiency anemia, compared with only 2% of adult men. The most
common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in young women is blood lost
during menstruation. Iron deficiency anemia can be avoided by getting
the recommended amount of iron in one's diet. Anemia is often treated or
prevented by taking iron supplements.

Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron
every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron
every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron
every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources
of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as
beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include
seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to
them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are
listed below ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U291cmNlc0lyb24.) ). Eating vitamin C
along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the
body can absorb.

  **Food**                                  **Milligrams (mg) of Iron**

  Cooked ground beef, 3 oz.                 2.2
  Cooked sirloin beef, 3 oz.                2.0

#### Sickle-Cell Anemia {#12.html#x-ck12-U2lja2xlLUNlbGwgQW5lbWlh_26-qoa}

**Sickle-cell anemia** is a blood disease that is caused by an
abnormally shaped hemoglobin protein in red blood cells. Many of the red
blood cells of a person with sickle-cell anemia are long and curved
(sickle-shaped) ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0xOS1zaWNrbGUtY2VsbA..) ). The long,
sickle shape of the cells can cause them to get stuck in narrow blood
vessels. This clotting means that oxygen cannot reach the cells. People
with sickle-cell anemia are most often well but can occasionally have
painful attacks. The disease is not curable, but it can be treated with
medicines.

#### Blood Cancer {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgQ2FuY2Vy_26-fzu}

Blood cancers affect the production and function of your blood cells.
Most of these cancers start in your bone marrow where blood is produced.
In most blood cancers, the normal production of blood cells is replaced
by uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell. These abnormal
blood cells are cancerous cells, and prevent your blood from performing
many of its functions, like fighting off infections or preventing
serious bleeding. **Leukemia** is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow.
It is characterized by an abnormal production of blood cells, usually
white blood cells. **Lymphoma** is a cancer of a type of white blood
cell called lymphocytes. There are many types of lymphoma.

#### Hemophilia {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVtb3BoaWxpYQ.._26-pyg}

**Hemophilia** is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect
the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a
lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally
released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce
clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk
of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into
muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-ttw}

-   Blood diseases can affect red blood cells, white blood cells,
    or platelets.
-   Blood diseases include sickle-cell anemia, leukemia, lymphoma,

**Why check your blood pressure?**

It's a good idea to have a blood pressure test as part of a routine
physical, especially in adulthood. High blood pressure is a risk factor
for heart disease and stroke. It's important to know if you have high
blood pressure, so it can be treated. A combination of medications and
lifestyle changes can be successful in lowering your blood pressure.

### Blood Pressure {#12.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgUHJlc3N1cmU._27-rpe}

The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your
cardiovascular system. One measure of the health of your cardiovascular
system is blood pressure. **Blood pressure** occurs when circulating
blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. Since blood pressure
is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the
arteries move in a rhythmic fashion. Blood in arteries is under the
greatest amount of pressure. The pressure of the circulating blood
slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller
blood vessels. Blood in veins is not under much pressure.

#### Healthy Blood Pressure Ranges {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVhbHRoeSBCbG9vZCBQcmVzc3VyZSBSYW5nZXM._27-fqb}

Blood pressure is read as two numbers. The first number is the systolic
pressure. The **systolic** pressure is the pressure on the blood vessels
when the heart beats. This is the time when there is the highest
pressure in the arteries. The **diastolic** pressure, which is the
second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is
resting between beats.

Healthy ranges for blood pressure are:

-   Systolic: less than 120
-   Diastolic: less than 80

Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic. For example, a reading
of 120/80 is said as "one twenty over eighty." These measures of blood
pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day.
Pressure varies with exercise, emotions, sleep, stress, nutrition,
drugs, or disease.

Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115,
rather than 120, have fewer health problems. Clinical trials have shown
that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have
much better long term cardiovascular health. Blood pressure is measured
with a sphygmomanometer ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0yMC1zcGh5Z21vbWFub21ldGVy) ).

**Hypertension** , which is also called "high blood pressure," occurs
when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to
be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or
higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or
higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing
heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious
cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms,
so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For
this reason, hypertension is often called the "silent killer."
Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and
medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk,
spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate.

Some health conditions, as well as a person's lifestyle and genetic
background, can put someone at a higher risk for developing high blood
pressure. As a person cannot alter their genetic background, lifestyle
changes may be necessary to reduce the chance of developing high blood
pressure. These changes include getting enough exercise, limiting the
amount of sodium (salt) in the diet, not being overweight, not drinking
alcohol to excess, and not smoking.

Low blood pressure is not usually a concern, as long as there are no
problems associated with the low pressure. Symptoms associated with low
blood pressure include dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting,
dehydration and unusual thirst, lack of concentration, blurred vision,
nausea, and fatigue.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-rtk}

-   Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the
    walls of blood vessels.
-   Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can increase the risk of

**How do you "fix" arteries?**

When a blood vessel gets clogged, there is no medical equivalent of
"Drano" that will clear it out. There is, however, a procedure known as
angioplasty. A thin tube with a balloon is threaded through the blood
vessels. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the clog
against the artery wall.

### Cardiovascular Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2FyZGlvdmFzY3VsYXIgRGlzZWFzZXM._28-7tx}

A **cardiovascular disease (CVD)** is any disease that affects the
cardiovascular system. But the term is usually used to describe diseases
that are linked to atherosclerosis.

**Atherosclerosis** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0yMS1hdGhlcm9zY2xlcm9zaXM.) ) is an
inflammation of the walls of arteries that causes swelling and a buildup
of material called plaque. **Plaque** is made of cell pieces, fatty
substances, calcium, and connective tissue that builds up around the
area of inflammation. As a plaque grows, it stiffens and narrows the
artery, which decreases the flow of blood through the artery.

up](ck12_12_files/20150911113734092701.jpeg "Atherosclerosis occurs when artery walls become inflamed and plaque builds up")

**Figure 12.51**

Atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to as hardening of the arteries;
plaque build-up decreases the blood flow through the artery.

</div>

Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found
in most major arteries. It does not usually have any early symptoms.
Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol,
smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to
health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart
or the brain. A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart
attack. Blockage of the circulation in the brain can cause a stroke.

Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting
plenty of exercise and not smoking. These three factors are not as hard
to control as you may think. If you smoke, STOP. Start a regular
exercise program and watch what you eat.

A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your cholesterol
levels, which makes more plaque available to line artery walls and
narrow your arteries. Cholesterol and saturated fats are found mostly in
animal products such as meat, eggs, milk, and other dairy products.
Check food labels to find the amount of saturated fat in a product.
Also, avoid large amounts of salt and sugar. Be careful with processed
foods, such as frozen dinners, as they can be high in fat, sugar, salt
and cholesterol. Eat lots of fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables,
smaller portions of lean meats and fish, and whole grains such as oats
and whole wheat. Limit saturated fats like butter, instead choose
unsaturated vegetable oils such as canola oil.

#### Coronary Heart Disease {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29yb25hcnkgSGVhcnQgRGlzZWFzZQ.._28-qeh}

Like any other muscle, your heart needs oxygen. Hearts have arteries
that provide oxygen through the blood. They are known as **coronary
arteries** . **Coronary heart disease** is the end result of the buildup
of plaque within the walls of the coronary arteries.

Coronary heart disease often does not have any symptoms. A symptom of
coronary heart disease is chest pain. Occasional chest pain can happen
during times of stress or physical activity. The pain of angina means
the heart muscle fibers need more oxygen than they are getting. Most
people with coronary heart disease often have no symptoms for many years
until they have a heart attack.

A **heart attack** happens when the blood cannot reach the heart because
a blood vessel is blocked. If cardiac muscle is starved of oxygen for
more than roughly five minutes, it will die. Cardiac muscle cells cannot
be replaced, so once they die, they are dead forever. Coronary heart
disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States.
The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can
cause a heart attack and cause part of the heart muscle to die (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0yMi1ibG9ja2VkLWNvcm9uYXJ5LWFydGVyeQ..)
). Maybe one day stem cells will be used to replace dead cardiac muscle
cells.

**Figure 12.52**

A blockage in a coronary artery stops oxygen from getting to part of the
heart muscle, so areas of the heart that depend on the blood flow from
the blocked artery are starved of oxygen.

</div>

#### Stroke {#12.html#x-ck12-U3Ryb2tl_28-hd2}

Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke.
A **stroke** is a loss of brain function due to a blockage of the blood
supply to the brain. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood
pressure, having a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and
smoking. The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low blood
pressure.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._28-xim}

-   Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the inside of arteries
    become clogged with plaque, a deposit of fatty material.
-   Atherosclerosis can be dangerous when it prevents blood circulation
    to the heart or the brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.

**Why is smoking bad for you?**

Most people associate smoking with lung disease. But that is not the
only health risk of smoking. Smoking is also a major cause of
cardiovascular disease.

### Keeping Your Cardiovascular System Healthy {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBZb3VyIENhcmRpb3Zhc2N1bGFyIFN5c3RlbSBIZWFsdGh5_29-pxo}

There are many risk factors that can cause a person to develop
cardiovascular disease. A **risk factor** is anything that is linked to
an increased chance of developing a disease. Some of the risk factors
for cardiovascular disease you cannot control, but there are many risk
factors you can control.

Risk factors you cannot control include:

-   *Age* : The older a person is, the greater their chance of
    developing a cardiovascular disease.
-   *Gender* : Men under age 64 are much more likely to die of coronary
    heart disease than women, although the gender difference decreases
    with age.
-   *Genetics* : Family history of cardiovascular disease increases a
    person’s chance of developing heart disease.

Risk factors you can control include many lifestyle factors:

-   *Tobacco smoking* : Giving up smoking or never starting to smoke is
    the best way to reduce the risk of heart disease.
-   *Diabetes* : Diabetes can cause bodily changes, such as high
    cholesterol levels, which are are risk factors for
    cardiovascular disease.
-   *High cholesterol levels* : High amounts of "bad cholesterol,"
    increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
-   *Obesity* : Having a very high percentage of body fat, especially if
    the fat is mostly found in the upper body, rather than the hips and
    thighs, increases risk significantly.
-   *High blood pressure* : If the heart and blood vessels have to work
    harder than normal, this puts the cardiovascular system under
    a strain.
-   *Lack of physical activity* : Aerobic activities, such as the one
    pictured below ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0yMy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXBsYXllcg..) ),
    help keep your heart healthy. To reduce the risk of disease, you
    should be active for at least 60 minutes a day, five days a week.
-   *Poor eating habits* : Eating mostly foods that do not have many
    nutrients other than fat or carbohydrate leads to high cholesterol
    levels, obesity, and cardiovascular disease ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOC0yNC1teS1weXJhbWlk) ).

#### What is bad cholesterol? {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBiYWQgY2hvbGVzdGVyb2w__29-8x7}

Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and
from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein,
or LDL, is known as "bad" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is
known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in
the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries
that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can
form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a
narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes
from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad
cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should
be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and
increases HDL cholesterol.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-j9d}

-   A family history of cardiovascular disease increases a person’s
    chance of developing heart disease.
-   Having a poor diet and not getting enough exercise are two major
    causes of cardiovascular disease.

**Why do you breathe?**

We breathe because we need oxygen. Breathing also releases carbon
dioxide from our bodies into the air. The respiratory system is the body
system that brings air containing oxygen into the body and releases
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Recall that oxygen is needed to make
ATP.

### How We Breathe {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IFdlIEJyZWF0aGU._30-6ij}

Most of the time, you breathe without thinking about it. Breathing is
mostly an involuntary action that is controlled by a part of your brain
that also controls your heart beat. If you swim, do yoga, or sing, you
know you can control your breathing, however. Taking air into the body
through the nose and mouth is called **inhalation** . Pushing air out of
the body through the nose or mouth is called **exhalation** . The woman
pictured below is exhaling before she surfaces from the pool water (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wMy1icmVhdGhpbmctY29udHJvbA..) ).

**Figure 12.55**

Being able to control breathing is important for many activities, such
as swimming. The woman in the photograph is exhaling as she exits the
water.

</div>

How do lungs allow air in? Air moves into and out of the lungs by the
movement of muscles. The most important muscle in the process of
breathing is the **diaphragm** , a sheet of muscle that spreads across
the bottom of the rib cage. The diaphragm and rib muscles contract and
relax to move air into and out of the lungs. During inhalation, the
diaphragm contracts and moves downward. The rib muscles contract and
cause the ribs to move outward. This causes the chest volume to
increase. Because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside
the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. This difference in air
pressures causes air to be sucked into the lungs. When the diaphragm and
rib muscles relax, air is pushed out of the lungs. Exhalation is similar
to letting the air out of a balloon.

How does the inhaled oxygen get into the bloodstream? The exchange of
gasses between the lungs and the blood happens in tiny sacs called
**alveoli** . The walls of the alveoli are very thin and allow gases to
pass though them. The alveoli are lined with capillaries ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wNC1hbHZlb2xpLWNhcGlsbGFyaWVz) ).
Oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries that
surround the alveoli. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves in the
opposite direction, from capillary blood to the alveoli. The gases move
by simple diffusion, passing from an area of high concentration to an
area of low concentration. For example, initially there is more oxygen
in the alveoli than in the blood, so oxygen moves by diffusion from the
alveoli into the blood.

During respiration, oxygen gets pulled into the lungs and enters the
blood by passing across the thin alveoli membranes and into the
capillaries. The alveoli are at the end of the long air passages.

#### Breathing and Respiration {#12.html#x-ck12-QnJlYXRoaW5nIGFuZCBSZXNwaXJhdGlvbg.._30-x0p}

The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon dioxide
is called **respiration** . Sometimes breathing is called respiration,
but there is much more to respiration than just breathing. Breathing is
only the movement of oxygen into the body and carbon dioxide out of the
body. The process of respiration also includes the exchange of oxygen
and carbon dioxide between the blood and the cells of the body.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-gya}

-   The diaphragm and rib muscles contract when you inhale and relax
    when you exhale.
-   The process of getting oxygen into the body and releasing carbon
    dioxide is called respiration.

**What are the organs that help you breathe?**

When you think of the processes of breathing, the lungs probably come to
mind. The lungs are the main organ of the respiratory system. However,
many other organs are also needed for the process of respiration to take
place.

### Organs of The Respiratory System {#12.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5zIG9mIFRoZSBSZXNwaXJhdG9yeSBTeXN0ZW0._31-y8o}

Your respiratory system is made up of the tissues and organs that allow
oxygen to enter your body and carbon dioxide to leave your body. Organs
in your respiratory system include your:

-   Nose.
-   Mouth.
-   Larynx.
-   Pharynx.

**Figure 12.57**

The organs of the respiratory system move air into and out of the body.

</div>

What do you think is the purpose of each of these organs?

-   The nose and the nasal cavity filter, warm, and moisten the air
    you breathe. The nose hairs and the mucus produced by the cells in
    the nose catch particles in the air and keep them from entering
    the lungs.
-   Behind the nasal cavity, air passes through the **pharynx** , a
    long tube. Both food and air pass through the pharynx.
-   The **larynx** , also called the "voice box," is found just below
    the pharynx. Your voice comes from your larynx. Air from the lungs
    passes across thin tissues in the larynx and produces sound.
-   The **trachea** , or windpipe, is a long tube that leads down to the
    lungs, where it divides into the right and left **bronchi** . The
    bronchi branch out into smaller bronchioles in each lung. There is
    small flap called the epiglottis that covers your trachea when you
    eat or drink. The muscle controlling the epiglottis is involuntary
    and prevents food from entering your lungs or wind pipe.
-   The bronchioles lead to the alveoli. **Alveoli** are the little sacs
    at the end of the bronchioles ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-QWx2ZW9saUluTHVuZ3M.) ). They look like
    little bunches of grapes. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in
    the alveoli. That means oxygen enters the blood, and carbon dioxide
    moves out of the blood. The gases are exchanged between the blood
    and alveoli by simple diffusion.
-   The **diaphragm** is a sheet of muscle that spreads across the
    bottom of the rib cage. When the diaphragm contracts, the chest
    volume gets larger, and the lungs take in air. When the diaphragm
    relaxes, the chest volume gets smaller, and air is pushed out of
    the lungs.

**Where does oxygen go in your body?**

Once you take in a breath of air, the oxygen doesn't just stay there in
your lungs. It has a lot of traveling to do! Oxygen has to reach each
one of your cells. How do you think the oxygen is moved?

### The Journey of a Breath of Air {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEpvdXJuZXkgb2YgYSBCcmVhdGggb2YgQWly_32-b69}

Breathing is only part of the process of bringing oxygen to where it is
needed in the body. After oxygen enters the lungs, what happens?

1.  The oxygen enters the bloodstream from the **alveoli** , tiny sacs
    in the lungs where gas exchange takes place ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wNS1nYXMtZXhjaGFuZ2U.) ). The
    transfer of oxygen into the blood is through simple diffusion.
2.  The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart.
3.  Oxygen-rich blood is then pumped through the **aorta** , the large
    artery that receives blood directly from the heart.
4.  From the aorta, oxygen-rich blood travels to the smaller arteries
    and, finally, to the **capillaries** , the smallest type of
    blood vessel.
5.  The oxygen molecules move, by diffusion, out of the capillaries and
    into the body cells.
6.  While oxygen moves from the capillaries and into body cells, carbon
    dioxide moves from the cells into the capillaries.
7.  Carbon dioxide is brought, through the blood, back to the heart and
    then to the lungs. Then it is released into the air
    during exhalation.

Why is oxygen needed by each cell in your body? To make ATP, the usable
form of cellular energy. Oxygen is needed in the final stage of cellular
respiration, which is the process of converting glucose into ATP. This
process is much more efficient in the presence of oxygen. Without
oxygen, much less ATP is produced. As ATP is needed for the cells to
function properly, every cell in your body needs oxygen. Getting that
oxygen begins with inhaling. The oxygen moves into your blood, where it
travels to every cell in your body.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._32-xcp}

-   Oxygen enters the lungs, then passes through the alveoli and into
    the blood. The oxygen is carried around the body in blood vessels.
-   Carbon dioxide moves into the blood capillaries and is brought to
    the lungs to be released into the air during exhalation.

This inhaler can help ease the symptoms of asthma. This girl may have
felt an asthma attack coming on. Tightness in the chest and difficulty

asthma can usually be controlled with medicine.

### Diseases of the Respiratory System {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlzZWFzZXMgb2YgdGhlIFJlc3BpcmF0b3J5IFN5c3RlbQ.._33-mdh}

Respiratory diseases are diseases of the lungs, bronchial tubes,
trachea, nose, and throat ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wNi13aG9vcGluZy1jb3VnaA..) ). These
diseases can range from a mild cold to a severe case of pneumonia.
Respiratory diseases are common. Many are easily treated, while others
may cause severe illness or death. Some respiratory diseases are caused
by bacteria or viruses, while others are caused by environmental
pollutants, such as tobacco smoke. Some diseases are genetic and,
therefore, are inherited.

**Figure 12.60**

This boy is suffering from whooping cough (also known as pertussis),
which gets its name from the loud whooping sound that is made when the
person inhales during a coughing fit.

</div>

#### Bronchitis {#12.html#x-ck12-QnJvbmNoaXRpcw.._33-ifz}

**Bronchitis** is an inflammation of the bronchi, the air passages that
conduct air into the lungs. The bronchi become red and swollen with
infection. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses or bacteria,
and may last several days or weeks. It is characterized by a cough that
produces phlegm, or mucus. Symptoms include shortness of breath and
wheezing. Acute bronchitis is usually treated with antibiotics.

#### Asthma {#12.html#x-ck12-QXN0aG1h_33-ufh}

**Asthma** is a chronic illness in which the bronchioles, the tiny
branches into which the bronchi are divided, become inflamed and narrow
( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wNy1hc3RobWEtYnJvbmNoaW9sZXM.) ). The
muscles around the bronchioles contract, which narrows the airways.
Large amounts of mucus are also made by the cells in the lungs. People
with asthma have difficulty breathing. Their chests feel tight, and they
wheeze. Asthma can be caused by different things, such as allergies.
Asthma can also be caused by cold air, warm air, moist air, exercise, or
stress. The most common asthma triggers are illnesses, like the common
cold. Asthma is not contagious and cannot be passed on to other people.
Children and adolescents who have asthma can still lead active lives if
they control their asthma. Asthma can be controlled by taking medication
and by avoiding contact with environmental triggers for asthma, like
smoking.

#### Pneumonia {#12.html#x-ck12-UG5ldW1vbmlh_33-l2v}

**Pneumonia** is an illness that occurs when the alveoli, the tiny sacs
in the lungs where gas exchange takes place, become inflamed and filled
with fluid. When a person has pneumonia, gas exchange cannot occur
properly across the alveoli. Pneumonia can be caused by many things.
Infection by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites can cause pneumonia.
An injury caused by chemicals or a physical injury to the lungs can also
cause pneumonia. Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, chest pain, fever,
and difficulty breathing. Treatment depends on the cause of pneumonia.
Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics.

Pneumonia is a common illness that affects people in all age groups. It
is a leading cause of death among the elderly and people who are
chronically and terminally ill.

#### Tuberculosis {#12.html#x-ck12-VHViZXJjdWxvc2lz_33-csi}

**Tuberculosis (TB)** is a common and often deadly disease caused by a
genus of bacterium called *Mycobacterium* . Tuberculosis most commonly
attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is a
chronic disease, but most people who become infected do not develop the
full disease. Symptoms include a cough, which usually contains mucus and
coughing up blood.

The TB bacteria are spread in the air when people who have the disease
cough, sneeze, or spit, so it is very contagious. To help prevent the
spread of the disease, public health notices, such as the one pictured
below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wOC1wdWJsaWMtaGVhbHRoLW5vdGljZQ..) ),
remind people how to stop the spread of the disease.

#### Lung Cancer {#12.html#x-ck12-THVuZyBDYW5jZXI._33-n5i}

**Lung cancer** is a disease in which the cells found in the lungs grow
out of control. The growing mass of cells can form a tumor that pushes
into nearby tissues. The tumor will affect how these tissues work. Lung
cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men, and the
second most common in women. It is responsible for 1.3 million deaths
worldwide every year ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0wOS1DYW5jZXJvdXMtbHVuZw..) ). The
most common symptoms are shortness of breath, coughing (including
coughing up blood), and weight loss. The most common cause of lung
cancer is exposure to tobacco smoke.

#### Emphysema {#12.html#x-ck12-RW1waHlzZW1h_33-l0r}

**Emphysema** is a chronic lung disease caused by the breakdown of the
lung tissue. Symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath,
especially during exercise, and chronic cough, usually due to cigarette
smoking, and wheezing, especially during expiration. Damage to the
alveoli ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xMC1lbXBoeXNlbWEtY29wZC1sdW5n) ), is
not curable. Smoking is the leading cause of emphysema.

#### Causes of Respiratory Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIFJlc3BpcmF0b3J5IERpc2Vhc2Vz_33-6lr}

Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. A **pathogen** is an
organism that causes disease in another organism. Certain bacteria,
viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common
cold and flu are caused by viruses. The influenza virus that causes the
flu is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xMS1IMW4x) ). Tuberculosis, whooping
cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that
cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by
coughing, sneezing, and spitting. Illnesses caused by bacteria can be
treated with antibiotics. Those caused by viruses cannot.

This represents the influenza virus that causes the swine flu, or H1N1.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children
between the ages of 6 months and 19 years get a flu vaccination each
year.

</div>

Pollution is another common cause of respiratory disease. The quality of
the air you breathe can affect the health of your lungs. Asthma, heart
and lung diseases, allergies, and several types of cancers are all
linked to air quality. Air pollution is not just found outdoors; indoor
air pollution can also be responsible for health problems.

Smoking is the major cause of chronic respiratory disease as well as
cardiovascular disease and cancer. Exposure to tobacco smoke by smoking
or by breathing air that contains tobacco smoke is the leading cause of
preventable death in the United States. Regular smokers die about 10
years earlier than nonsmokers do. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) describes tobacco use as "the single most important
preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important
cause of \[early\] death worldwide." Simply stated: Stopping smoking can
prevent many respiratory diseases.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-qv1}

-   Common diseases and conditions affecting the respiratory system

**Why sneeze into your elbow?**

Sneezing into your elbow can help stop the spread of a respiratory
illness, like the flu or common cold. If you sneeze into your hands, you
may then spread germs when you touch a doorknob or other surfaces.

### Keeping Your Respiratory System Healthy {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBZb3VyIFJlc3BpcmF0b3J5IFN5c3RlbSBIZWFsdGh5_34-zgm}

We know that many respiratory illnesses are caused by bacteria or
viruses. There are steps you can take to help the spread of these
pathogens, and also to prevent you from catching one. Furthermore, many
respiratory illnesses are caused by poor habits, such as smoking. Many
of the diseases related to smoking are called **lifestyle diseases** .
Lifestyle diseases are diseases that are caused by choices that people
make in their daily lives. For example, the choice to smoke can lead to
emphysema, cancer and heart disease in later life. But you can make
healthy choices instead. There are many things you can do to keep
yourself healthy.

#### Avoid Smoking {#12.html#x-ck12-QXZvaWQgU21va2luZw.._34-hwl}

Cigarette smoking can cause serious diseases, so not smoking or quitting
now are the most effective ways to reduce your risk of developing
chronic respiratory diseases, such as lung cancer. Avoiding (or
stopping) smoking is the single best way to prevent many respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases. Also, do your best to avoid secondhand smoke.

#### Eat Well, Exercise Regularly, and Get Rest {#12.html#x-ck12-RWF0IFdlbGwsIEV4ZXJjaXNlIFJlZ3VsYXJseSwgYW5kIEdldCBSZXN0_34-sz5}

Eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and being active every day
can help keep your respiratory system, cardiovascular system and immune
system strong. Getting enough exercise makes your lungs stronger and
better at giving your body the oxygen it needs. It also helps to boost
your body fight germs that could make you sick. These can also, of
course, keep your skeletal and muscular systems strong.

#### Wash Your Hands {#12.html#x-ck12-V2FzaCBZb3VyIEhhbmRz_34-k0p}

Washing your hands often, especially after sneezing, coughing, or
blowing your nose, helps to protect you and others from diseases.
Washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and warm water can help
prevent colds and flu. In one respect, you can think of hand washing as
a survival skill. Some viruses and bacteria can live from 20 minutes to
two hours or more on surfaces like cafeteria tables, doorknobs, and
desks. Washing your hands often can remove many of these pathogens.
Never touch your mouth, nose, or eyes without washing your hands.

#### Avoid Contact with Others When Sick {#12.html#x-ck12-QXZvaWQgQ29udGFjdCB3aXRoIE90aGVycyBXaGVuIFNpY2s._34-hgp}

Do not go to school or to other public places when you are sick. You
risk spreading your illness to other people. You may also get even
sicker if you catch something else. Do not share food and other things
that go in the mouth, as in guzzling milk from the carton or double
dipping chips. You never know what pathogens can be lurking around.
Cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and to dispose
of the tissue yourself. No time to grab a tissue. Cough or sneeze into
the inside of your elbow instead of your hands.

#### Visit Your Doctor {#12.html#x-ck12-VmlzaXQgWW91ciBEb2N0b3I._34-ack}

Getting the recommended vaccinations can help prevent diseases, such as
whooping cough and flu. In fact, a yearly flu vaccine is recommended for
everyone who is at least 6 months of age. The flu vaccine is especially
important for people who are at high risk of developing serious
complications (like pneumonia) if they get sick with the flu. People who
have certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and chronic
lung disease, pregnant women, and people younger than 5 years (and
especially those younger than 2), and people 65 years and older should
also make sure they get the yearly flu vaccine.

Seeking medical help for diseases like asthma can help stop the disease
from getting worse. If you are unsure if you should go to the doctor,
call the doctor's office and ask.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._34-cja}

-   Avoid smoking, get enough exercise, and wash your hands to protect
    your respiratory system from illness.

**What happens to your body's waste?**

There is no space for a landfill in your body to contain wastes. You
must be able to expel wastes from your body. This is the role of the
excretory system.

### Excretion {#12.html#x-ck12-RXhjcmV0aW9u_35-fqg}

So what happens to your body's wastes? Obviously, you must get rid of
them. This is the job of the excretory system. You remove waste as a gas
(carbon dioxide), as a liquid (urine and sweat), and as a solid.
**Excretion** is the process of removing wastes and excess water from
the body.

Recall that carbon dioxide travels through the blood and is transferred
to the lungs where it is exhaled. In the large intestine, the remains of
food are turned into solid waste for excretion. How is waste other than
carbon dioxide removed from the blood? That is the role of the kidneys.

**Urine** is a liquid waste formed by the kidneys as they filter the
blood. If you are getting plenty of fluids, your urine should be almost
clear. But you might have noticed that sometimes your urine is darker
than usual. Do you know why this happens? Sometimes your body is low on
water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine. Therefore,
your urine gets darker than usual. Your body is striving to maintain
**homeostasis** through the process of excretion.

Urine helps remove excess water, salts, and nitrogen from your body.
Your body also needs to remove the wastes that build up from cell
activity and from digestion. If these wastes are not removed, your cells
can stop working, and you can get very sick. The organs of your
**excretory system** help to release wastes from the body.

The organs of the excretory system are also parts of other organ
systems. For example, your lungs are part of the respiratory system.
Your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your body, so they are also part
of the excretory system. More organs of the excretory system are listed
below ( **Table**

  Large intestine   Removes solid waste and some water in the form of feces.   Digestive system

**Why is urine important?**

You might have had to give a urine sample when you've gone to the doctor
for a check-up. Urine is basically your liquid waste. The contents of
your urine can tell the doctor if you have certain illnesses.

### The Urinary System {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFVyaW5hcnkgU3lzdGVt_36-rll}

Sometimes, the urinary system ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xMy11cmluYXJ5LXN5c3RlbQ..) ) is
called the excretory system. But the urinary system is only one part of
the excretory system. Recall that the excretory system is also made up
of the skin, lungs, and large intestine, as well as the kidneys. The
**urinary system** is the organ system that makes, stores, and gets rid
of urine.

**Figure 12.66**

The kidneys filter the blood that passes through them, and the urinary
bladder stores the urine until it is released from the body.

</div>

#### Organs of the Urinary System {#12.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5zIG9mIHRoZSBVcmluYXJ5IFN5c3RlbQ.._36-c0m}

1.  As you can see above ( **Figure**
    [above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xMy11cmluYXJ5LXN5c3RlbQ..) ), the
    kidneys are two bean-shaped organs. **Kidneys** filter and clean the
    blood and form urine. They are about the size of your fists and are
    found near the middle of the back, just below your ribcage.
2.  **Ureters** are tube-shaped and bring urine from the kidneys to the
    urinary bladder.
3.  The **urinary bladder** is a hollow and muscular organ. It is shaped
    a little like a balloon. It is the organ that collects urine.
4.  Urine leaves the body through the **urethra** .

#### What is Urine? {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBVcmluZT8._36-won}

**Urine** is a liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they filter
wastes from the blood. Urine contains mostly water, but it also contains
salts and nitrogen-containing molecules. The amount of urine released
from the body depends on many things. Some of these include the amount
of fluid and food a person consumes and how much fluid they have lost
from sweating and breathing. Urine ranges from colorless to dark yellow
but is usually a pale yellow color. Light yellow urine contains mostly
water. The darker the urine, the less water it contains.

The urinary system also removes a type of waste called **urea** from
your blood. Urea is a nitrogen-containing molecule that is made when
foods containing protein, such as meat, poultry, and certain vegetables,
are broken down in the body. Urea and other wastes are carried in the
bloodstream to the kidneys, where they are removed and form urine.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._36-wmg}

-   The urinary system is made up of the kidneys, the ureters, the
    bladder, and the urethra.
-   Urine is the liquid that is formed by the kidneys when they filter

**Why are the kidneys important?**

These kidney beans are named after a very important organ in your body.
Though you probably can live without these beans, you can't live without
at least one kidney. The kidneys have several essential functions. For
example, kidneys filter your blood, removing wastes and regulating the
amount of water in your body.

### The Kidneys {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEtpZG5leXM._37-hff}

The kidneys ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xNC1raWRuZXktc3RydWN0dXJlcw..) ) are
important organs in maintaining **homeostasis** , the ability of the
body to maintain a stable internal environment despite a changing
environment. Kidneys perform a number of homeostatic functions.

-   They maintain the volume of body fluids.
-   They maintain the balance of salt ions in body fluids.
-   They excrete harmful nitrogen-containing molecules, such as urea,
    ammonia, and uric acid.

**Figure 12.67**

Structures of the kidney; fluid leaks from the capillaries and into the
nephrons where the fluid forms urine then moves to the ureter and on to
the bladder.

</div>

There are many blood vessels in the kidneys ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xNC1raWRuZXktc3RydWN0dXJlcw..) ). The
kidneys remove urea and other wastes from the blood through tiny
filtering units called nephrons. **Nephrons** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xNS1uZXBocm9uLXVyZXRlcg..) ) are
tiny, tube-shaped structures found inside each kidney. Each kidney has
up to a million nephrons. Each nephron collects a small amount of fluid
and waste from a small group of capillaries.

Nitrogen-containing wastes, together with water and other wastes, form
the **urine** as it passes through the nephrons and the kidney. The
fluid within nephrons is carried out into a larger tube in the kidney
called a **ureter** , which carries it to the bladder ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xNS1uZXBocm9uLXVyZXRlcg..) ).

The kidneys never stop filtering waste products from the blood, so they
are always producing urine. The amount of urine your kidneys produce is
dependent on the amount of fluid in your body. Your body loses water
through sweating, breathing, and urination. The water and other fluids
you drink every day help to replace the lost water. This water ends up
circulating in the blood because blood plasma is mostly water.

</div>

#### Formation of Urine {#12.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIFVyaW5l_37-fuj}

The process of urine formation is as follows:

1.  Blood flows into the kidney through the renal artery. The renal
    artery connects to capillaries inside the kidney. Capillaries and
    nephrons lie very close to each other in the kidney.
2.  The blood pressure within the capillaries causes water, salts,
    sugars, and urea to leave the capillaries and move into the nephron.
3.  The water and salts move along through the tube-shaped nephron to a
    lower part of the nephron.
4.  The fluid that remains in the nephron at this point is called urine.
5.  The blood that leaves the kidney in the renal vein has much less
    waste than the blood that entered the kidney.
6.  The urine is collected in the ureters and is moved to the urinary
    bladder, where it is stored.

Nephrons filter about ¼ cup of body fluid per minute. In a 24-hour
period, nephrons filter 180 liters of fluid, and 1.5 liters of the fluid
is released as urine. Urine enters the bladder through the ureters.
Similar to a balloon, the walls of the bladder are stretchy. The
stretchy walls allow the bladder to hold a large amount of urine. The
bladder can hold about 1½ to 2½ cups of urine but may also hold more if
the urine cannot be released immediately.

How do you know when you have to urinate? **Urination** is the process
of releasing urine from the body. Urine leaves the body through the
urethra. Nerves in the bladder tell you when it is time to urinate. As
the bladder first fills with urine, you may notice a feeling that you
need to urinate. The urge to urinate becomes stronger as the bladder
continues to fill up.

#### Brain Control of Urination {#12.html#x-ck12-QnJhaW4gQ29udHJvbCBvZiBVcmluYXRpb24._37-gyi}

The filtering action of the kidneys is controlled by the **pituitary
gland** . The pituitary gland is about the size of a pea and is found
below the brain ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xNi1waXR1aXRhcnk.) ). The pituitary
gland releases hormones that help the kidneys to filter water from the
blood.

The movement of water back into blood is controlled by a hormone called
**antidiuretic hormone** (ADH). ADH is one of the hormones released from
the pituitary gland in the brain. One of the most important roles of ADH
is to control the body’s ability to hold onto water. If a person does
not drink enough water, ADH is released. It causes the blood to reabsorb
water from the kidneys. If the kidneys remove less water from the blood,
what will the urine look like? It will look darker, because there is
less water in it.

When a person drinks a lot of water, then there will be a lot of water
in the blood. The pituitary gland will then release a lower amount of
ADH into the blood. This means less water will be reabsorbed by the
blood. The kidneys then produce a large volume of urine. What color will
this urine be?

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._37-pkp}

-   Water and waste molecules move out of the blood capillaries and into
    the nephrons of the kidney to form the urine.
-   ADH is the hormone released by the pituitary gland and controls how
    water is reabsorbed by the blood from the kidneys.

**Why drink water?**

It's always a good idea to drink plenty of fluids, especially when you
have been exercising. Drinking plenty of water helps to flush away
materials that might form kidney stones. Staying hydrated is the best
way to prevent kidney stones.

### Problems of the Excretory System {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmxlbXMgb2YgdGhlIEV4Y3JldG9yeSBTeXN0ZW0._38-43a}

The urinary system controls the amount of water in the body and removes
wastes. Any problem with the urinary system can also affect many other
body systems.

#### Kidney Stones {#12.html#x-ck12-S2lkbmV5IFN0b25lcw.._38-lqg}

In some cases, certain mineral wastes can form **kidney stones** (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xNy1raWRuZXktc3RvbmU.) ).
Stones form in the kidneys and may be found anywhere in the urinary
system. Often, stones form when the urine becomes concentrated, allowing
minerals to crystallize and stick together. They can vary in size, from
small stones that can flow through your urinary system, to larger stones
that cannot. Some stones cause great pain, while others cause very
little pain. Some stones may need to be removed by surgery or ultrasound
treatments.

What are the symptoms of kidney stones? You may have a kidney stone if
you have pain while urinating, see blood in your urine, and/or feel a
sharp pain in your back or lower abdomen (the area between your chest
and hips). The pain may last for a long or short time. You may also have
nausea and vomiting with the pain. If you have a small stone that passes
on its own easily, you may not experience any symptoms. If you have some
of these symptoms, you should see your doctor.

#### Kidney failure {#12.html#x-ck12-S2lkbmV5IGZhaWx1cmU._38-bks}

**Kidney failure** happens when the kidneys cannot remove wastes from
the blood. If the kidneys are unable to filter wastes from the blood,
the wastes build up in the body. Kidney failure can be caused by an
accident that injures the kidneys, the loss of a lot of blood, or by
some drugs and poisons. Kidney failure may lead to permanent loss of
kidney function. But if the kidneys are not seriously damaged, they may
recover.

Chronic kidney disease is the slow decrease in kidney function that may
lead to permanent kidney failure. A person who has lost kidney function
may need to get kidney dialysis. **Kidney dialysis** is the process of
filtering the blood of wastes using a machine. A dialysis machine (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xOS0xOC1EaWFseXNpcy1tYWNoaW5l)
) filters waste from the blood by pumping the blood through a fake
kidney. The filtered blood is then returned to the patient’s body.

#### Urinary tract infections (UTIs) {#12.html#x-ck12-VXJpbmFyeSB0cmFjdCBpbmZlY3Rpb25zIChVVElzKQ.._38-hwq}

**Urinary tract infections** (UTIs) are bacterial infections of any part
of the urinary tract. When bacteria get into the bladder or kidney and
produce more bacteria in the urine, they cause a UTI. The most common
type of UTI is a bladder infection. Women get UTIs more often than men.
UTIs are often treated with antibiotics.

Most UTIs are not serious, but some infections can lead to serious
problems. Long lasting kidney infections can cause permanent damage,
including kidney scars, poor kidney function, high blood pressure, and
other problems. Some sudden kidney infections can be life threatening,
especially if the bacteria enter the bloodstream, a condition called
septicemia.

What are the signs and symptoms of a UTI?

-   a burning feeling when you urinate,
-   frequent or intense urges to urinate, even when you have little
    urine to pass,
-   pain in your back or side below the ribs,
-   cloudy, dark, bloody, or foul-smelling urine,
-   fever or chills.

You should see your doctor if you have signs of a UTI. Your doctor will
diagnose a UTIs by asking about your symptoms and then testing a sample
of your urine.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._38-0jr}

-   Disorders of the urinary system include kidney stones, kidney
    failure, and urinary tract infections.

**What body system helps you learn?**

As these girls are studying, many processes are taking place. Their eyes
have to take in the words on the page, and their brains have to process
the meaning of the words. The brain also has to assimilate the knowledge
so it can be retrieved at a later time. All these processes are
controlled by the nervous system.

### Introduction to the Nervous System {#12.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIHRoZSBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbQ.._39-wde}

Michelle was riding her scooter when she hit a hole in the street and
started to lose control. She thought she would fall, but, in the blink
of an eye, she shifted her weight and kept her balance. Her heart was
pounding, but at least she didn’t get hurt. How was she able to react so
quickly? Michelle can thank her nervous system for that ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wMS1TY29vdGVy) ).

![Staying balanced on a scooter requires control of the body's muscles
and awareness of the
surroundings](ck12_12_files/20150911113740947696.jpeg "Staying balanced on a scooter requires control of the body's muscles and awareness of the surroundings")

**Figure 12.72**

Staying balanced when riding a scooter requires control over the body’s
muscles. The nervous system controls the muscles and maintains balance.

</div>

The **nervous system,** together with the **endocrine system,** controls
all the other **organ systems.** The nervous system sends one type of
signal around the body, and the endocrine system sends another type of
signal around the body. The endocrine system makes and releases chemical
messenger molecules, or hormones, which tell other body parts that a
change or a reaction is necessary. So what type of signal does the
nervous system send?

Controlling muscles and maintaining balance are just two of the roles of
the nervous system. The nervous system also lets you:

-   Sense your surroundings with your eyes and other sense organs.
-   Sense the environment inside of your body, including temperature.
-   Control your internal body systems and keep them in balance.
-   Prepare your body to fight or flee in an emergency.
-   Use language, think, learn, and remember.

The nervous system works by sending and receiving electrical signals.
The main organs of the nervous system are the brain and the spinal cord.
The signals are carried by **nerves** in the body, similar to the wires
that carry electricity all over a house. The signals travel from all
over the body to the spinal cord and up to the brain, as well as moving
in the other direction. For example, when Michelle started to fall off
her scooter, her nervous system sensed that she was losing her balance.
It responded by sending messages from her brain to muscles in her body.
Some muscles tightened while others relaxed. Maybe these actions moved
her hips or her arms. The nervous system, working together with the
muscular and skeletal systems, allowed Michelle to react to the
situation. As a result, Michelle’s body became balanced again. The
messages released by the nervous system traveled through nerves. Just
like the electricity that travels through wires, nerve quickly carry the
electrical messages around the body.

Think about how quickly all this happens. It has to be really fast,
otherwise Michelle would not have been able to react. What would happen
if a car pulled out unexpectedly in front of Michelle? A signal would
have to go from her eyes to her brain and then to her muscles. What
allows the nervous system to react so fast. It starts with the special
cell of the nervous system, the neuron.

**What do nerve cells look like?**

Note that like most other cells, these nerve cells have a nucleus. They
also have other organelles. However, the long, threadlike extensions of
the nerve cells are unique. This is where the nerve impulses are
transmitted.

### Neurons and Nerve Impulses {#12.html#x-ck12-TmV1cm9ucyBhbmQgTmVydmUgSW1wdWxzZXM._40-uml}

The nervous system is made up of nerves. A **nerve** is a bundle of
nerve cells. A nerve cell that carries messages is called a **neuron** (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wMi1uZXVyb24.) ). The
messages carried by neurons are called **nerve impulses** . Nerve
impulses can travel very quickly because they are electrical impulses.

Think about flipping on a light switch when you enter a room. When you
flip the switch, the electricity flows to the light through wires inside
the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the
light, but the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch.
Nerve impulses travel just as fast through the network of nerves inside
the body.

faster signal
transmission](ck12_12_files/20150911113741382182.jpeg "The axons of many neurons are covered in a myelin sheath to allow for faster signal transmission")

**Figure 12.73**

The axons of many neurons, like the one shown here, are covered with a
fatty layer called myelin sheath. The sheath covers the axon, like the
plastic covering on an electrical wire, and allows nerve impulses to
travel faster along the axon. The node of Ranvier, shown in this
diagram, is any gap in the myelin sheath; it allows faster transmission
of a signal.

</div>

#### What Does a Neuron Look Like? {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBEb2VzIGEgTmV1cm9uIExvb2sgTGlrZT8._40-nvp}

A neuron has a special shape that lets it pass signals from one cell to
another. A neuron has three main parts ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wMi1uZXVyb24.) ):

1.  The cell body.
2.  Many dendrites.
3.  One axon.

The **cell body** contains the nucleus and other organelles. Dendrites
and axons connect to the cell body, similar to rays coming off of the
sun. **Dendrites** receive nerve impulses from other cells. **Axons**
pass the nerve impulses on to other cells. A single neuron may have
thousands of dendrites, so it can communicate with thousands of other
cells but only one axon. The axon is covered with a **myelin sheath** ,
a fatty layer that insulates the axon and allows the electrical signal
to travel much more quickly. The **node of Ranvier** is any gap within
the myelin sheath exposing the axon, and it allows even faster
transmission of a signal.

#### Types of Neurons {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTmV1cm9ucw.._40-niw}

Neurons are usually classified based on the role they play in the body.
Two main types of neurons are sensory neurons and motor neurons.

-   **Sensory neurons** carry nerve impulses from sense organs and
    internal organs to the central nervous system.
-   **Motor neurons** carry nerve impulses from the central nervous
    system to organs, glands, and muscles—the opposite direction.

Both types of neurons work together. Sensory neurons carry information
about the environment found inside or outside of the body to the central
nervous system. The central nervous system uses the information to send
messages through motor neurons to tell the body how to respond to the
information.

#### The Synapse {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN5bmFwc2U._40-xyn}

The place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another is
called a **synapse** . Synapses are also found between neurons and other
types of cells, such as muscle cells. The axon of the sending neuron
does not actually touch the dendrite of the receiving neuron. There is a
tiny gap between them, the synaptic cleft ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wMy1TeW5hcHNl) ).

**Figure 12.74**

This diagram shows a synapse between neurons. When a nerve impulse
arrives at the end of the axon, neurotransmitters are released and
travel to the dendrite of another neuron, carrying the nerve impulse
from one neuron to the next.

</div>

The following steps describe what happens when a nerve impulse reaches
the end of an axon.

1.  When a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon, the axon releases
    chemicals called **neurotransmitters** .
2.  Neurotransmitters travel across the synapse between the axon and the
    dendrite of the next neuron.
3.  Neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite.
4.  The binding allows the nerve impulse to travel through the
    receiving neuron.

Did you ever watch a relay race? After the first runner races, he or she
passes the baton to the next runner, who takes over. Neurons are a
little like relay runners. Instead of a baton, they pass
neurotransmitters to the next neuron. Examples of neurotransmitters are
chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline.

You can watch an animation of nerve impulses and neurotransmitters at
[http://www.mind.ilstu.edu/curriculum/neurons\_intro/neurons\_intro.php](neurons_intro.php)
.

Some people have low levels of the neurotransmitter called serotonin in
their brain. Scientists think that this is one cause of depression.
Medications called antidepressants help bring serotonin levels back to
normal. For many people with depression, antidepressants control the
symptoms of their depression and help them lead happy, productive lives.

**What's the control center of your body?**

Your brain is like the control center of your body. It controls your
breathing and heartbeat. It helps you to think and learn. The brain is
so "central" to all your body systems, it's not surprising that the
brain and spinal cord are called the central nervous system.

### The Central Nervous System {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbnRyYWwgTmVydm91cyBTeXN0ZW0._41-nsl}

The **central nervous system** (CNS) ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wNC1jZW50cmFsLW5lcnZvdXMtc3lzdGVt) )
is the largest part of the nervous system. It includes the **brain** and
the **spinal cord** . The bony skull protects the brain. The spinal cord
is protected within the bones of the spine, which are called
**vertebrae** .

#### The Brain {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJyYWlu_41-rfn}

What weighs about three pounds and contains up to 100 billion cells? The
answer is the human brain. The brain is the control center of the
nervous system. It’s like the pilot of a plane. It tells other parts of
the nervous system what to do.

The brain is also the most complex organ in the body. Each of its 100
billion neurons has synapses connecting it with thousands of other
neurons. All those neurons use a lot of energy. In fact, the adult brain
uses almost a quarter of the total energy used by the body. The
developing brain of a baby uses an even greater amount of the body’s
total energy.

The brain is the organ that lets us understand what we see, hear, or
sense in other ways. It also allows us to use language, learn, think,
and remember. The brain controls the organs in our body and our
movements as well. The brain consists of three main parts, the cerebrum,
the cerebellum, and the brain stem ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wNS1zaWRlLXZpZXctb2YtYnJhaW4.) ).

1.  The **cerebrum** is the largest part of the brain. It sits on top of
    the brain stem. The cerebrum controls functions that we are aware
    of, such as problem-solving and speech. It also controls voluntary
    movements, like waving to a friend. Whether you are doing your
    homework or jumping hurdles, you are using your cerebrum.
2.  The **cerebellum** is the next largest part of the brain. It lies
    under the cerebrum and behind the brain stem. The cerebellum
    controls body position, coordination, and balance. Whether you are
    riding a bicycle or writing with a pen, you are using
    your cerebellum.
3.  The **brain stem** is the smallest of the three main parts of
    the brain. It lies directly under the cerebrum. The brain stem
    controls basic body functions, such as breathing, heartbeat,
    and digestion. The brain stem also carries information back and
    forth between the cerebrum and spinal cord.

**Figure 12.76**

Side view of the brain ( *right* ). Can you find the locations of the
three major parts of the brain? Top view of the brain ( *left* ).

</div>

The cerebrum is divided into a right and left half ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wNS1zaWRlLXZpZXctb2YtYnJhaW4.) ).
Each half of the cerebrum is called a hemisphere. The two hemispheres
are connected by a thick bundle of axons called the **corpus callosum**
. It lies deep inside the brain and carries messages back and forth
between the two hemispheres.

Did you know that the right hemisphere controls the left side of the
body, and the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body? By
connecting the two hemispheres, the corpus callosum allows this to
happen.

Each hemisphere of the cerebrum is divided into four parts, called
lobes. The four lobes are the:

1.  Frontal.
2.  Parietal.
3.  Temporal.
4.  Occipital.

Each lobe has different jobs. Some of the functions are listed below (
**Table** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q2VyZWJydW1Mb2JlRnVuY3Rpb25z)
).

  **Lobe**    **Main Function(s)**

  Parietal    Speech, taste, reading
  Temporal    Hearing, smell

The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons, protected by
the vertebrae. It runs from the brain stem to the lower back. The main
job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between
the body and brain. The spinal cord is like a two-way highway. Messages
about the body, both inside and out, pass through the spinal cord to the
brain. Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the
spinal cord to tell the body what to do.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._41-ccp}

-   The central nervous system is made up of the brain and the
    spinal cord.
-   The brain consists of three main parts: the cerebrum, the
    cerebellum, and the brain stem.

**How does your brain connect to the rest of your body?**

You know you have nerves in your fingers and toes because you can feel
them. But how does your brain know what's going on in these nerves? You
have a network of nerves running from your brain and spinal cord to your
fingers and toes and the rest of your body. This network is known as the
peripheral nervous system.

### The Peripheral Nervous System {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBlcmlwaGVyYWwgTmVydm91cyBTeXN0ZW0._42-lqd}

There are other nerves in your body that are not found in the brain or
spinal cord. The **peripheral nervous system** (PNS) ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wNi1wZXJpcGhlcmFsLW5lcnZvdXMtc3lzdGVt)
) contains all the nerves in the body that are found outside of the
central nervous system. They include nerves of the hands, arms, feet,
legs, and trunk. They also include nerves of the scalp, neck, and face.
Nerves that send and receive messages to the internal organs are also
part of the peripheral nervous system.

**Figure 12.77**

The blue lines in this drawing represent nerves of the peripheral
nervous system. Every peripheral nerve is connected directly or
indirectly to the spinal cord. Notice the thick sciatic nerve. It is the
longest (and thickest) nerve in the body, running from the lower region
of the spinal cord to just above the knee.

</div>

The peripheral nervous system is divided into two parts, the sensory
division and the motor division. How these divisions of the peripheral
nervous system are related to the rest of the nervous system is shown
below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wNy1zZW5zb3J5LWFuZC1tb3Rvci1kaXZpc2lvbnM.)
). Refer to the figure as you read more about the peripheral nervous
system in the text that follows.

**Figure 12.78**

The sensory division interprets messages from sense organs and internal
organs, and the motor division sends messages to internal organs,
glands, and muscles.

</div>

#### The Sensory Division {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNlbnNvcnkgRGl2aXNpb24._42-96i}

The **sensory division** carries messages from sense organs and internal
organs to the central nervous system. Human beings have several senses.
They include sight, hearing, balance, touch, taste, and smell. We have
special sense organs for each of these senses. What is the sense organ
for sight? For hearing?

Sensory neurons in each sense organ receive stimuli, or messages from
the environment that cause a response in the body. For example, sensory
neurons in the eyes send messages to the brain about light. Sensory
neurons in the skin send messages to the brain about touch. Our sense
organs recognize sensations, but they don’t tell us *what* we are
sensing. For example, when you breathe in chemicals given off by baking
cookies, your nose does not tell you that you are smelling cookies.
That’s your brain’s job. The sense organs send messages about sights,
smells, and other stimuli to the brain ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wOC1zZW5zb3J5LWRpdmlzaW9u) ). The
brain then reads the messages and tells you what they mean. A certain
area of the brain receives and interprets information from each sense
organ. For example, information from the nose is received and
interpreted by the temporal lobe of the cerebrum.

#### The Motor Division {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1vdG9yIERpdmlzaW9u_42-uyq}

The **motor division** of the peripheral system carries messages from
the central nervous system to internal organs and muscles. The motor
division is also divided into two parts ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wNy1zZW5zb3J5LWFuZC1tb3Rvci1kaXZpc2lvbnM.)
), the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.

The **somatic nervous system** carries messages that control body
movements. It is responsible for activities that are under your control,
such as waving your hand or kicking a ball. The girl pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0wOS1WaW9saW4tcGxheWluZw..)
) is using her somatic nervous system to control the muscles needed to
play the violin. Her brain sends messages to motor neurons that move her
hands so she can play. Without the messages from her brain, she would
not be able to move her hands and play the violin.

**Figure 12.80**

These women's central nervous systems are controlling the movements of
their hands and arms as they play the violin. Their brains send commands
to their somatic nervous system, which controls the muscles of their
hands and arms.

</div>

The **autonomic nervous system** carries nerve impulses to internal
organs. It controls activities that are not under your control, such as
sweating and digesting food. The autonomic nervous system has two parts:

1.  The **sympathetic division** controls internal organs and glands
    during emergencies. It prepares the body for fight or flight (
    **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xMC1maWdodC1mbGlnaHQ.) ). For
    example, it increases the heart rate and the flow of blood to the
    legs, so you can run away from danger.
2.  The **parasympathetic division** controls internal organs and glands
    during the rest of the time. It controls processes like digestion,
    heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency.

The woman pictured here is just pretending to be frightened, but
assuming that she really was scared, think of which division of the
autonomic nervous system would prepare her body for an emergency.

</div>

Have you ever become frightened and felt your heart start pounding? How
does this happen? The answer is your autonomic nervous system. The
sympathetic division prepared you to deal with a possible emergency by
increasing your heart rate. The fact that this happened in the blink of
an eye shows how amazing the nervous system is.

**How have you used your vision today?**

Maybe you were just doing some schoolwork. Or walking down the hallway.
No matter what you were doing, you were probably using your sense of
sight. You may depend on your sense of sight so much that it's hard to
think of anything you do without it, except sleep. Why is sight so
important?

### The Nature of Human Vision {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE5hdHVyZSBvZiBIdW1hbiBWaXNpb24._43-mvt}

Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a
typical school day. As soon as they open their eyes in the morning, they
might look at the clock to see what time it is. Then, they might look
out the window to see what the weather is like. They probably look in a
mirror to comb their hair. In school, they use their eyes to read the
board, their textbooks, and the expressions on their friends' faces.
After school, they might keep their eye on the ball while playing
basketball ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xMS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXNpZ2h0) ). Then,
they might read their homework assignment and text messages from their
friends.

**Figure 12.82**

All eyes are on the ball in this basketball game. Think about how we use
the sense of sight in other games.

</div>

Sight, or **vision** , is the ability to see light. It depends on the
eyes detecting light and forming images. It also depends on the brain
making sense of the images, so that we know what we are seeing. Human
beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals.
It’s not surprising, then, that we have a better sense of vision than
many other animals. Not only can we normally see both distant and
close-up objects clearly, but we can also see in three dimensions and in
color.

But humans do not have the best vision. You may think you see things
fairly clearly. Imagine if you could see even better. How about 8 times
better? Raptors, or birds of prey, including the eagles, hawks and
falcons can see up to 8 times more clearly than the sharpest human eye.
A golden eagle for example can see a rabbit from a mile away. Why do you
think they have such a good sense of vision? Other animals also have
much better night vision then us.

#### Seeing in Three Dimensions {#12.html#x-ck12-U2VlaW5nIGluIFRocmVlIERpbWVuc2lvbnM._43-tj9}

Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie, like the boy pictured
below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xMi10aHJlZS1kaW1lbnNpb25hbC12aXNpb24.)
)? If you did, then you know that the glasses make people and objects in
the movie appear to jump out of the screen. They make images on the flat
movie screen seem more realistic because they give them depth. That’s
the difference between seeing things in two dimensions and three
dimensions.

**Figure 12.83**

This boy is wearing 3-D glasses; when you look at objects and people in
the real world, your eyes automatically see in three dimensions.

</div>

We are able to see in three dimensions because we have two eyes facing
the same direction but a few inches apart. As a result, we see objects
and people with both eyes at the same time but from slightly different
angles.

Hold up a finger a few inches away from your face, and look at it, first
with one eye and then with the other. You’ll notice that your finger
appears to move. Now hold up your finger at arm’s length, and look at it
with one eye and then the other. Your finger seems to move less than it
did when it was closer. Although you aren’t aware of it, your brain
constantly uses such differences to determine the distance of objects.

#### Seeing in Color {#12.html#x-ck12-U2VlaW5nIGluIENvbG9y_43-ctb}

For animals like us that see in color, it may be hard to imagine a world
that appears to be mainly shades of gray. You can get an idea of how
many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture
of colorful objects. For example, look at the apple on the tree pictured
below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xMy1jb2xvci12aXNpb24.) ). In the top
picture, they appear in color, the way you would normally see them. In
the bottom picture they appear without color, in shades of gray (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xNC1CVy12aXNpb24.) ).

**Figure 12.85**

This black-and-white picture gives an idea of how many animals see the
world. Dogs and cats would see the green and red colors as shades of
gray; they are able to see blue, but red and green appear the same to
them. Many animals see just one or two colors. Some see colors that we
cannot see. Apes and chimps see the same colors as us.

</div>

But whereas many animals cannot see colors, some animals see colors that
we cannot. The range of color vision of bees and butterflies for
example, extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see. The
leaves of the flowers they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns
which guide the insects deep into the flower.

#### Evolution and Primate Vision {#12.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIGFuZCBQcmltYXRlIFZpc2lvbg.._43-ylk}

Why do you think primates, including humans, evolved the ability to see
in three dimensions and in color? To answer that question, you need to
know a little about primate evolution. Millions of years ago, primate
ancestors lived in trees. To move about in the trees, they needed to be
able to judge how far away the next branch was. Otherwise, they might
have a dangerous fall. Being able see in depth was important. It was an
adaptation that would help tree-living primates survive.

Primate ancestors also mainly ate fruit. They needed to be able to spot
colored fruits in the leafy background of the trees ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xNS1yaXBlLWNoZXJyaWVz) ). They also
had to be able to judge which fruits were ripe and which were still
green. Ripe fruits are usually red, orange, yellow, or purple. Being
able to see in color was important for finding food. It was an
adaptation that would help fruit-eating primates survive.

**How do you see the board?**

As you are sitting in the classroom, you may at first be focused on a
paper directly in front of you. Then you may look to the front of the
room to see a math problem worked out on the board. How can your eyes
focus directly in front of you and then, a second later, at a distance?
Your eyes are rather amazing!

vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens
and the retina of the eye, and the hyaloid canal is a small transparent
canal running through the vitreous humor from the optical disc to the
lens.

Vision involves sensing and focusing light from people and objects. The
steps involved are as follows:

1.  First, light passes through the cornea of the eye. The **cornea** is
    a clear, protective covering on the outside of the eye.
2.  Next, light passes through the pupil. The **pupil** is a black
    opening in the eye that lets light enter the eye.
3.  After passing into the eye through the pupil, light passes through
    the lens. The **lens** of the eye is a clear, curved structure.
    Along with the cornea, the lens helps focus light at the back of
    the eye. This is pictured below ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0xNy1sZW5z) ).
4.  The lens must bend light from nearby objects more than it bends
    light from far-away objects. The lens changes shape to bend the
    light by just the right amount to bring objects into focus.
5.  The lens focuses light on the **retina** , which covers the back of
    the inside of the eye. The retina has light-sensing photoreceptor
    cells called rods and cones. **Rods** let us see in dim light.
    **Cones** let us detect light of different colors.
6.  When light hits rods and cones, it causes chemical changes. The
    chemical changes start nerve impulses. The nerve impulses travel to
    the brain through the **optic nerve** .
7.  The brain makes sense of the nerve impulses and tells you what you
    are seeing.

**Figure 12.88**

Light from objects at different distances is focused by the lens of the
eye. Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is
focused on the back of the eye no matter how far the object is from the
lens.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._44-h8s}

-   Light entering the eye is focused by the lens on the retina, which
    sends messages to the brain through the optic nerve.
-   Muscles in the eye control the shape of the lens so the light is

**Why get an eye exam?**

During a routine eye exam, your vision will be evaluated to see if you
need glasses or contacts. Also, the eye doctor checks your eyes for
diseases that could lead to vision loss. About one of every two people
end up needing some sort of vision correction during their lifetime.

### Vision Correction {#12.html#x-ck12-VmlzaW9uIENvcnJlY3Rpb24._45-aop}

You probably know people who need eyeglasses or contact lenses to see
clearly. Maybe you need them yourself. Lenses are used to correct vision
problems. Two of the most common vision problems are myopia and
hyperopia.

#### Myopia {#12.html#x-ck12-TXlvcGlh_45-iny}

**Myopia** is also called nearsightedness. It affects about one third of
people. People with myopia can see nearby objects clearly, but distant
objects appear blurry. The picture below shows how a person with myopia
might see two boys that are a few meters away ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yMS1teW9waWE.) ).

**Figure 12.89**

On the left, you can see how a person with normal vision sees two boys.
The right image shows how a person with myopia sees the boys.

</div>

In myopia, the eye is too long. Below, you can see how images are
focused on the retina of someone with myopia ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yMi1jb3JyZWN0aXZlLWxlbnNlcw..) ).
Myopia is corrected with a **concave** lens, which curves inward like
the inside of a bowl. The lens changes the focus, so images fall on the
retina as they should.

individuals with myopia and
hyperopia](ck12_12_files/20150911113745792295.jpeg "This illustrations shows how light rays are improperly focused in individuals with myopia and hyperopia")

**Figure 12.90**

The eye of a person with myopia is longer than normal. As a result,
images are focused in front of the retina ( *top left* ). A concave lens
is used to correct myopia to help focus images on the retina ( *top
right* ). Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when objects are focused
in back of the retina ( *bottom left* ). It is corrected with a convex
lens ( *bottom right* ).

</div>

Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is
some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents
need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too.
Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a
computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to
develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during
childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However,
nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or
health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is
difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the
whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Eyeglasses or contact lenses can easily help with myopia. Depending on
the amount of myopia, you may only need to wear glasses or contact
lenses for certain activities, like watching a movie or driving a car.
Or, if you are very nearsighted, they may need to be worn all the time.

#### Farsightedness {#12.html#x-ck12-RmFyc2lnaHRlZG5lc3M._45-w34}

Farsightedness is also known as **hyperopia** . It affects about one
fourth of people. People with hyperopia can see distant objects clearly,
but nearby objects appear blurry. In hyperopia, the eye is too short.
This results in images being focused in back of the retina ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yMi1jb3JyZWN0aXZlLWxlbnNlcw..) ).
Hyperopia is corrected with a **convex** lens, which curves outward like
the outside of a bowl. The lens changes the focus so that images fall on
the retina as they should.

Common signs of farsightedness include difficulty in concentrating and
maintaining a clear focus on close objects, eye strain, fatigue and
headaches after close work, and aching or burning eyes, especially after
intense concentration on close work.

In addition to lenses, many cases of myopia and hyperopia can be
corrected with surgery. For example, a procedure called LASIK
(Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis) uses a laser to permanently
change the shape of the cornea so light is correctly focused on the
retina.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._45-no6}

-   Vision problems such as myopia and hyperopia can be corrected with
    lenses that help focus light on the retina.
-   Myopia is corrected with a concave lens, while hyperopia is
    corrected with a convex lens.

**Feeling dizzy?**

Have you ever gotten off a spinning ride at an amusement park and felt
dizzy? Why does this happen? It actually all goes back to your ears!
When you stop spinning, the fluid in the canals of your ears is still
moving. Sensing the position of the liquid in the canals usually helps
you keep balance, so spinning the fluid throws you off balance.

### Hearing and Balance {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVhcmluZyBhbmQgQmFsYW5jZQ.._46-f3q}

What do listening to music and riding a bike have in common? It might
surprise you to learn that both activities depend on your ears. The ears
do more than just detect sound. They also sense the position of the body
and help maintain balance.

#### Hearing {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVhcmluZw.._46-03n}

**Hearing** is the ability to sense sound. Sound travels through the air
in waves, much like the waves you see in the water pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfcmlwcGxl) ). Sound waves in
air cause vibrations inside the ears. The ears sense the vibrations.

**Figure 12.91**

Sound waves travel through the air in all directions away from a sound,
like waves traveling through water away from where a pebble was dropped.

The human ear is pictured below ( **Figure**

about it, trace the path of sound waves through the ear. Assume a car
horn blows in the distance. Sound waves spread through the air from the
horn. Some of the sound waves reach your ear. The steps below show what
happens next. They explain how your ears sense the sound.

**Figure 12.92**

Read the names of the parts of the ear in the text; then find each of
the parts in the diagram. Note that the round window is distinct from
the oval window.

</div>

1.  The sound waves travel to the **ear canal** ( *external auditory
    canal* in the figure). This is a tube-shaped opening in the ear.
2.  At the end of the ear canal, the sound waves hit the **eardrum** (
    *tympanic membrane* ). This is a thin membrane that vibrates like
    the head of a drum when sound waves hit it.
3.  The vibrations pass from the eardrum to the **hammer** (
    *malleus* ). This is the first of three tiny bones that pass
    vibrations through the ear.
4.  The hammer passes the vibrations to the **anvil** ( *incus* ), the
    second tiny bone that passes vibrations through the ear.
5.  The anvil passes the vibrations to the **stirrup** ( *stapes* ), the
    third tiny bone that passes vibrations through the ear.
6.  From the stirrup, the vibrations pass to the **oval window** . This
    is another membrane like the eardrum.
7.  The oval window passes the vibrations to the **cochlea** . The
    cochlea is filled with liquid that moves when the vibrations pass
    through, like the waves in water when you drop a pebble into a pond.
    Tiny hair cells line the cochlea and bend when the liquid moves.
    When the hair cells bend, they release neurotransmitters.
8.  The neurotransmitters trigger nerve impulses that travel to the
    brain through the auditory nerve ( *cochlear nerve* ). The brain
    reads the sound and “tells” you what you are hearing.

No doubt you’ve been warned that listening to loud music or other loud
sounds can damage your hearing. It’s true. In fact, repeated exposure to
loud sounds is the most common cause of hearing loss. The reason? Very
loud sounds can kill the tiny hair cells lining the cochlea. The hair
cells do not generally grow back once they are destroyed, so this type
of hearing loss is permanent. You can protect your hearing by avoiding
loud sounds or wearing earplugs or other ear protectors.

#### Balance {#12.html#x-ck12-QmFsYW5jZQ.._46-zfm}

Did you ever try to stand on one foot with your eyes closed? Try it and
see what happens, but be careful! It’s harder to keep your balance when
you can’t see. Your eyes obviously play a role in balance. But your ears
play an even bigger role. The gymnast pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yNi1neW1uYXN0LWJhbGFuY2U.) ) may not
realize it, but her ears—along with her cerebellum—are mostly
responsible for her ability to perform on the balance beam.

**Figure 12.93**

This gymnast is using the semicircular canals in her ears, along with
the cerebellum in her brain, to help keep her balance on the balance

</div>

The parts of the ears involved in balance are the **semicircular
canals** . Above, the semicircular canals are colored purple (
**Figure** [above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yNS1wYXJ0cy1vZi1lYXI.) ).
The canals contain liquid and are like the bottle of water pictured
below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yNy13YXRlci1ib3R0bGUtc2VtaWNpcmN1bGFyLWNhbmFscw..)
). When the bottle tips, the water surface moves up and down the sides
of the bottle. When the body tips, the liquid in the semicircular canals
moves up and down the sides of the canals. Tiny hair cells line the
semicircular canals. Movement of the liquid inside the canals causes the
hair cells to send nerve impulses. The nerve impulses travel to the
cerebellum in the brain along the vestibular nerve. In response, the
cerebellum sends commands to muscles to contract or relax so that the
body stays balanced.

**What if you felt no pain?**

It might sound good to you to have a condition where you feel no pain.
But actually this type of condition would be very dangerous. What would
happen if you strained your back but felt no pain? Instead of resting
your back, you might injure it further.

### Touch {#12.html#x-ck12-VG91Y2g._47-yfc}

When you look at the prickly cactus pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yOC1jYWN0dXM.) ), does the word
"ouch" come to mind? Touching the cactus would be painful. **Touch** is
the sense of pain, pressure, or temperature. Touch depends on sensory
**neurons** , or nerve cells, in the skin. The skin on the palms of the
hands, soles of the feet, and face has the most sensory neurons and is
especially sensitive to touch. The tongue and lips are very sensitive to
touch as well. Neurons that sense pain are also found inside the body in
muscles, joints, and organs. If you have a stomach ache or pain from a
sprained ankle, it’s because of these sensory neurons found inside of
your body.

neurons to the brain, as well as how the brain responds to the messages.
Suppose you wanted to test the temperature of the water in a lake before
jumping in. You might stick one bare foot in the water. Neurons in the
skin on your foot would sense the temperature of the water and send a
message about it to your central nervous system. The frontal lobe of the
cerebrum would process the information. It might decide that the water
is really cold and send a message to your muscles to pull your foot out
of the water.

In some cases, messages about pain or temperature don’t travel all the
way to and from the brain. Instead, they travel only as far as the
spinal cord, and the spinal cord responds to the messages by giving
orders to the muscles. This allows you to respond to pain more quickly.
When messages avoid the brain in this way, it forms a **reflex arc** ,
like the one shown below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0yOS1yZWZsZXgtYXJj) ).

kick your leg—without even thinking about it. The nerve impulse from
your knee travels to the spinal cord, and the spinal cord sends a

#### Touch Receptors {#12.html#x-ck12-VG91Y2ggUmVjZXB0b3Jz_47-wuj}

Our sense of touch is controlled by a huge network of nerve endings and
touch receptors. This system is responsible for all the sensations we
feel, including cold, hot, smooth, rough, pressure, tickle, itch, pain,
vibrations, and more. There are four main types of receptors:
mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, pain receptors, and proprioceptors.

-   Mechanoreceptors perceive sensations such as pressure, vibrations,
    and texture. Your brain gets an enormous amount of information about
    the texture of objects through your fingertips because the ridges
    that make up your fingerprints are full of these
    sensitive receptors.
-   Thermoreceptors perceive sensations related to the temperature
    of objects. There are two basic categories of thermoreceptors: hot
    receptors and cold receptors. The highest concentration of
    thermoreceptors can be found in the face and ears.
-   Pain receptors, or nociceptor detect pain or stimuli that can or
    does cause damage to the skin and other tissues of the body. There
    are over three million pain receptors throughout the body, found in
    skin, muscles, bones, blood vessels, and some organs.
-   Proprioceptors detect the position of different parts of the body in
    relation to each other and the surrounding environment. These
    receptors are found in joints, tendons and muscles, and allow us to
    do fundamental things such as feeding or clothing ourselves.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._47-uto}

-   Sensory neurons in the skin sense pain, pressure, and temperature.
-   When sensory messages only travel as far as the spinal cord, and
    skip the brain, this is called a reflex arc.

**Why are your senses of taste and smell important?**

Imagine you open a gallon of milk, and you suddenly smell a foul odor.
Your sense of smell has informed you that the milk has spoiled. So you
pour the spoiled milk down the kitchen sink. Your sense of smell has
possibly kept you from getting sick!

### Taste and Smell {#12.html#x-ck12-VGFzdGUgYW5kIFNtZWxs_48-os5}

The senses of taste and smell are more complicated than many people
might think and have a surprisingly large impact on behavior, perception
and overall health. Imagine your sense of smell disappearing as you age.
Though this doesn't usually happen, it could provide clues about
diseases of the nervous system. What about differences in taste? Do all
foods taste the same to all people? Are there some foods you would never
eat because you don't like the taste? Does this food taste good to other
people? Genetic differences in taste could help predict what we eat, how
well our metabolism works, and even whether or not we're overweight.
These two senses actually work together to provide some of the basic
sensations of everyday life.

#### Taste {#12.html#x-ck12-VGFzdGU._48-rsl}

Your sense of taste is controlled by sensory **neurons** , or nerve
cells, on your tongue that sense the chemicals in food. The neurons are
grouped in bundles within **taste buds** . Each taste bud actually has a
pore that opens out to the surface of the tongue enabling molecules and
ions taken into the mouth to reach the receptor cells inside. There are
five different types of taste neurons on the tongue. Each type detects a
different taste. The tastes are:

1.  Sweet, which is produced by the presence of sugars, such as the
    common table sugar sucrose, and a few other substances.
2.  Salty, which is produced primarily by the presence of sodium ions.
    Common salt is sodium chloride, NaCl. The use of salt can donate the
    sodium ion producing this taste.
3.  Sour, which is the taste that detects acidity. The most common food
    group that contains naturally sour foods is fruit, such as lemon,
    grape, orange, and sometimes melon. Children show a greater
    enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy such as Lemon
    Drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst,
    is popular. Many of these candies contain citric acid.
4.  Bitter is an unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable taste. Common bitter
    foods and beverages include coffee, unsweetened cocoa, beer (due to
    hops), olives, and citrus peel.
5.  **Umami** , which is a meaty or savory taste. This taste can be
    found in fish, shellfish, cured meats, mushrooms, cheese, tomatoes,
    grains, and beans.

A single taste bud contains 50–100 taste cells representing all 5 taste
sensations. A stimulated taste receptor cell triggers action potentials
in a nearby sensory neuron, which send messages to the brain about the
taste. The brain then decides what tastes you are sensing.

#### Smell {#12.html#x-ck12-U21lbGw._48-bxl}

Your sense of smell also involves sensory neurons that sense chemicals.
The neurons are found in the nose, and they detect chemicals in the air.
Unlike taste neurons, which can detect only five different tastes, the
sensory neurons in the nose can detect thousands of different odors.
Have you ever noticed that you lose your sense of taste when your nose
is stuffed up? That’s because your sense of smell greatly affects your
ability to taste food. As you eat, molecules of food chemicals enter
your nose (actually your nasal cavity). You experience the taste and
smell at the same time. Being able to smell as well as taste food
greatly increases the number of different flavors you are able to sense.
For example, you can use your sense of taste alone to learn that a food
is sweet, but you have to also use your sense of smell to learn that the
food tastes like strawberry cheesecake.

Specific scents are often associated with our memories of places and
events. That's because scents are more novel or specific than shapes or
other things you might see. So an odor similar to that of your
grandmother's kitchen or pantry might be more quickly associated with
your memories of that place than a similar sight, which might be more
generalized.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._48-d1r}

-   Sensory neurons on the tongue detect five types of tastes: sweet,
    salty, sour, bitter, and umami.
-   Sensory neurons that sense chemicals in your nose allow you to
    detect smells.

**Why get vaccinations?**

Like this girl, many people are a little afraid of needles. But this is
no reason to avoid vaccinations. Vaccinations can help you avoid serious
diseases. For example, a vaccination to prevent meningitis, a serious
infection of the nervous system, is now available.

### Diseases of the Nervous System {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlzZWFzZXMgb2YgdGhlIE5lcnZvdXMgU3lzdGVt_49-oli}

The nervous system controls sensing, feeling, and thinking. It also
controls movement and just about every other body function. That’s why
problems with the nervous system can affect the entire body. Diseases of
the nervous system include brain and spinal cord infections. Other
problems of the nervous system range from very serious diseases, such as
tumors, to less serious problems, such as tension headaches. Some of
these diseases are present at birth. Others begin during childhood or
adulthood.

#### Central Nervous System Infections {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2VudHJhbCBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbSBJbmZlY3Rpb25z_49-tiv}

When you think of infections, you probably think of an ear infection or
strep throat. You probably don’t think of a brain or spinal cord
infection. But bacteria and viruses can infect these organs as well as
other parts of the body. Infections of the brain and spinal cord are not
very common. But when they happen, they can be very serious. That’s why
it’s important to know their symptoms.

#### Encephalitis {#12.html#x-ck12-RW5jZXBoYWxpdGlz_49-ntq}

**Encephalitis** is a brain infection ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0zMi1FbmNlcGhhbGl0aXM.) ). If you have
encephalitis, you are likely to have a fever and headache or feel drowsy
and confused. The disease is most often caused by viruses. The immune
system tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight
off other infections. But sometimes this can do more harm than good. The
immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain. With no room
to expand, the brain pushes against the skull. This may injure the brain
and even cause death. Medicines can help fight some viral infections of
the brain, but not all infections.

#### Meningitis {#12.html#x-ck12-TWVuaW5naXRpcw.._49-oft}

**Meningitis** is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and
spinal cord. If you have meningitis, you are likely to have a fever and
a headache. Another telltale symptom is a stiff neck. Meningitis can be
caused by viruses or bacteria. Viral meningitis often clears up on its
own after a few days. Bacterial meningitis is much more serious (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0zMy1iYWN0ZXJpYWwtbWVuaW5naXRpcw..) ).
It may cause brain damage and death. People with bacterial meningitis
need emergency medical treatment. They are usually given antibiotics to
kill the bacteria.

These bacteria, shown at more than 1,000 times their actual size, are
the cause of bacterial meningitis. Despite their tiny size, they can
cause very serious illness.

</div>

A vaccine to prevent meningitis recently became available. It can be
given to children as young as two years old. Many doctors recommend that
children receive the vaccine no later than age 12 or 13, or before they
begin high school.

#### Reye's Syndrome {#12.html#x-ck12-UmV5ZSdzIFN5bmRyb21l_49-fxi}

A condition called **Reye’s syndrome** can occur in young people that
take aspirin when they have a viral infection. The syndrome causes
swelling of the brain and may be fatal. Fortunately, Reye’s syndrome is
very rare. The best way to prevent it is by not taking aspirin when you
have a viral infection. Products like cold medicines often contain
aspirin. So, read labels carefully when taking any medicines (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0zNC1hc3BpcmluLXdhcm5pbmctbGFiZWw.) ).

Since 1988, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required that all
aspirin and aspirin-containing products carry a warning about Reye’s
syndrome.

#### Other Nervous System Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgTmVydm91cyBTeXN0ZW0gRGlzZWFzZXM._49-9ep}

Like other parts of the body, the nervous system may develop tumors. A
**tumor** is a mass of cells that grows out of control. A tumor in the
brain may press on normal brain tissues. This can cause headaches,
difficulty speaking, or other problems, depending on where the tumor is
located. Pressure from a tumor can even cause permanent brain damage. In
many cases, brain tumors can be removed with surgery. In other cases,
tumors can’t be removed without damaging the brain even more. In those
cases, other types of treatments may be needed.

**Cerebral palsy** is a disease caused by injury to the developing
brain. The injury occurs before, during, or shortly after birth.
Cerebral palsy is more common in babies that have a low weight at birth.
But the cause of the brain injury is not often known. The disease
usually affects the parts of the brain that control body movements.
Symptoms range from weak muscles in mild cases to trouble walking and
talking in more severe cases. There is no known cure for cerebral palsy.

**Epilepsy** is a disease that causes seizures. A seizure is a period of
lost consciousness that may include violent muscle contractions. It is
caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The cause of
epilepsy may be an infection, a brain injury, or a tumor. The seizures
of epilepsy can often be controlled with medicine. There is no known
cure for the disease, but children with epilepsy may outgrow it by
adulthood.

A headache is a very common nervous system problem. Headaches may be a
symptom of serious diseases, but they are more commonly due to muscle
tension. A tension headache occurs when muscles in the shoulders, neck,
and head become too tense. This often happens when people are “stressed
out.” Just trying to relax may help relieve this type of headache. Mild
pain relievers such as ibuprofen may also help.

**Figure 12.100**

Sometimes relaxation is the best “medicine” for a tension headache and
to help muscles get rid of pain.

</div>

A **migraine** is a more severe type of headache. It occurs when blood
vessels in the head dilate, or expand. This may be triggered by certain
foods, bright lights, weather changes, or other factors. People with
migraines may also have nausea or other symptoms. Fortunately, migraines
can often be relieved with prescription drugs.

There are many other nervous system diseases. They include multiple
sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s
disease. However, these diseases rarely, if ever, occur in young people.
Their causes and symptoms are listed below ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6SW5jdXJhYmxlTmVydm91c0Rpc2Vhc2Vz) ). The
diseases have no known cure, but medicines may help control their
symptoms.

**No diving?**

Make sure you always heed the advice of signs that say "no diving."
Diving in shallow water can lead to serious injuries to your nervous
system.

### Injuries of the Nervous System {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5qdXJpZXMgb2YgdGhlIE5lcnZvdXMgU3lzdGVt_50-62v}

Injuries to the central nervous system may damage tissues of the brain
or spinal cord. If an injury is mild, a person may have a full recovery.
If an injury is severe, it may cause permanent disability or even death.
Brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur because of car
crashes or sports accidents. The best way to deal with such injuries is
to try to prevent them.

#### Brain Injuries {#12.html#x-ck12-QnJhaW4gSW5qdXJpZXM._50-hv4}

Brain injuries can range from mild to extremely severe, but even mild
injuries need medical attention. Brain injuries can result from falls,
car accidents, violence, sports injuries, and war and combat. Falls are
the most common cause of brain injuries, particularly in older adults
and young children.

The mildest and most common type of brain injury is a **concussion** .
This is a bruise on the surface of the brain. It may cause temporary
problems such as headache, drowsiness, and confusion. Most concussions
in young people occur when they are playing sports, especially contact
sports like football. Other sports, like soccer, boxing, baseball,
lacrosse, skateboarding, and hockey can also result in concussions. A
concussion normally heals on its own in a few days.

A single concussion is unlikely to cause permanent damage. But repeated
concussions may lead to lasting problems. People who have had two or
more concussions may have life-long difficulties with memory, learning,
speech, or balance. For this reason, concussions are treated very
seriously among athletes and in professional sports. You can see an
animation of how a concussion occurs by visiting
[http://www.pennmedicine.org/encyclopedia/em\_DisplayAnimation.aspx?gcid=000034&ptid=17](em_DisplayAnimation.aspx?gcid=000034&ptid=17)
.

A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain
damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical
force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain
dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a
shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As
a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body
movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured.
Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems
with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other
treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or
at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Symptoms of severe brain injuries include

-   the loss of consciousness from several minutes to hours,
-   profound confusion,
-   slurred speech,
-   the inability to awaken from sleep,
-   seizures,
-   loss of coordination,
-   persistent headache or headache that worsens.

#### Spinal Cord Injuries {#12.html#x-ck12-U3BpbmFsIENvcmQgSW5qdXJpZXM._50-ebs}

A spinal cord injury is damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves
at the end of the spinal canal. This injury often causes permanent
changes in strength, sensation and other body functions below the site
of the injury.

Spinal cord injuries make it difficult for messages to travel between
the brain and body. They may cause a person to lose the ability to feel
or move parts of the body. This is called **paralysis** . Whether
paralysis occurs—and what parts of the body are affected if it
does—depends on the location and seriousness of the injury. In addition
to car crashes and sports injuries, diving accidents are a common cause
of spinal cord injuries. Quadriplegia means your arms, hands, trunk,
legs and pelvic organs are all affected by your spinal cord injury.
Paraplegia means the paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs
and pelvic organs. These people can still use their arms and hands.

Some people recover from spinal cord injuries. But many people are
paralyzed for life. Thanks to the work of Christopher Reeve ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0zNi1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1yZWV2ZQ..) ),
more research is being done on spinal cord injuries now than ever
before. For example, scientists are trying to discover ways to regrow
damaged spinal cord neurons.

**Figure 12.101**

Former "man of steel" *Superman* star Christopher Reeve (September 25,
1952 – October 10, 2004) was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall from
a horse. The injury crushed his spinal cord so his brain could no longer
communicate with his body.

</div>

If you suspect that someone has a back or neck injury:

-   don't move the injured person as permanent paralysis and other
    serious complications may result,
-   call 911 or your local emergency medical assistance number,
-   keep the person very still,
-   place heavy towels on both sides of the neck or hold the head and
    neck to prevent them from moving, until emergency care arrives,
-   provide basic first aid, such as stopping any bleeding and making
    the person comfortable, without moving the head or neck.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._50-84k}

-   Mild brain injuries, such as a concussion, normally heal on their
    own, while serious brain injuries can cause permanent physical and
    mental disabilities.
-   Spinal cord injuries can lead to paralysis, when a person loses the
    ability to feel or move parts of the body.

**Do you like doing puzzles?**

Activities that challenge your brain, such as working on a Sudoku
puzzle, are good for the health of your nervous system. Just like you
need to work out your body to stay in shape, your brain also needs a
good work out regularly in order to stay sharp.

### Keeping the Nervous System Healthy {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyB0aGUgTmVydm91cyBTeXN0ZW0gSGVhbHRoeQ.._51-jq2}

The nervous system is such an important part of your body. You want it
to work at its best so that you can be at your best. Your nervous system
contains what is probably the most important part of your body, which,
of course, is your brain. Your brain allows you to learn. It allows you
to feel emotions like love, anger, and sadness. Your brain gives you the
ability to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell. It works together with
the nerves and spinal cord to send the signals that make your body move.
Your nervous system lets you do things like run, jump, play sports, and
do your homework.

There are many choices you can make to keep your nervous system healthy.
One obvious choice is to avoid using alcohol or other drugs. Not only
will you avoid the injury that drugs themselves can cause, but you will
also be less likely to get involved in other risky behaviors that could
harm your nervous system. Another way to keep the nervous system healthy
is to eat a variety of healthy foods. The **minerals** sodium, calcium,
and potassium, and **vitamins** B ~1~ and B ~12~ are important for a
healthy nervous system. Some foods that are good sources for these
minerals and vitamins include milk, whole grains, beef steak, and kidney
beans (shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC0zOS1udXRyaWVudC1zb3VyY2Vz) ). Your
brain also needs healthy fats like those in nuts and fish. Recall that
fats insulate the axons of neurons. These fats help build new
connections between nerves and brain cells. These fats may improve
memory and increase learning and intelligence. Water is also important
for the nervous system, so drink plenty of water and other fluids. This
helps prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion and memory
problems. And get plenty of rest. Your brain requires plenty of rest so
it can strengthen circuits that help with memory. A good night’s sleep
will help keep your brain functioning at its best.

**Figure 12.102**

These foods are sources of nutrients needed for a healthy nervous
system.

</div>

Daily physical activity is also important for nervous system health.
Regular exercise makes your heart more efficient at pumping blood to
your brain. As a result, your brain gets more oxygen, which it needs to
function normally. The saying “use it or lose it” applies to your brain
as well as your body. This means that mental activity, not just physical
activity, is important for nervous system health. Doing crossword
puzzles, reading, and playing a musical instrument are just a few ways
you can keep your brain active.

You can also choose to practice safe behaviors to protect your nervous
system from injury. To keep your nervous system safe, choose to:

-   Wear safety goggles or sunglasses to protect your eyes from injury.
-   Wear hearing protectors, such as ear plugs to protect your ears from
    loud sounds.
-   Wear a safety helmet for activities like bike riding and skating (
    **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMC00MC1CaWtlLUhlbG1ldA..) ).
-   Wear a safety belt every time you ride in a motor vehicle.
-   Avoid unnecessary risks, such as performing dangerous stunts on
    your bike.
-   Never dive into water that is not approved for diving. If the water
    is too shallow, you could seriously injure your brain or
    spinal cord. A few minutes of fun could turn into a lifetime in
    a wheelchair.

**Figure 12.103**

Bicycle helmets help protect from head injuries. Making healthy choices
like this can help prevent nervous system injuries that could cause
lifelong disability.

</div>

Furthermore, make sure to exercise your nervous system on a daily basis.
The simple act of writing requires that you use all the major components
of your motor and sensory pathways. These include a number of different
sensory receptors, peripheral nerves, synaptic connections within your
spinal cord, major tracts within your spinal cord, and nerve tissue
throughout your brain. All these components need to be utilized with
great precision and coordination to produce neatly written words. What
should you do? Spend a few minutes each day writing on paper as neatly
as you can. This takes a lot more effort on the part of the nervous
system than typing on a keyboard, as typing on a keyboard doesn't
require as much fine motor control as writing on paper. If you don't
want to write, then draw. Drawing with precision also requires use of
all the major components of the sensory and motor divisions of the
nervous system.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._51-ujl}

-   The minerals, calcium and potassium, and vitamins B1 and B12 are
    important for a healthy nervous system.
-   You can make choices that will help keep your nervous system healthy

**What are germs?**

You know germs can make you sick. They can live anywhere, from on your
doorknob to in your food. A more scientific word for germ is pathogen.

### Pathogens {#12.html#x-ck12-UGF0aG9nZW5z_52-vqy}

Has this ever happened to you? A student sitting next to you in class
has a cold. The other student is coughing and sneezing, but you feel
fine. Two days later, you come down with a cold, too. Diseases like
colds are contagious. Contagious diseases are also called infectious
diseases. An **infectious disease** is a disease that spreads from
person to person.

Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. A **pathogen** is a living
thing or virus that causes disease. Pathogens are commonly called
“germs.” They can travel from one person to another.

#### Types of Pathogens {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUGF0aG9nZW5z_52-mhl}

Living things that cause human diseases include bacteria, fungi, and
protozoa. Most infectious diseases caused by these organisms can be
cured with medicines. For example, medicines called antibiotics can cure
most diseases caused by bacteria. Bacteria are one-celled organisms
without a nucleus. Although most bacteria are harmless, some cause
diseases.

Worldwide, the most common disease caused by bacteria is tuberculosis
(TB). TB is a serious disease of the lungs. Another common disease
caused by bacteria is strep throat. You may have had strep throat
yourself. Bacteria that cause strep throat are shown below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wMS1TdHJlcHRvY29jY3Vz) ). Some types
of pneumonia and many cases of illnesses from food are also caused by
bacteria.

**Figure 12.104**

The structures that look like strings of beads are bacteria. They belong
to the genus *Streptococcus* . Bacteria of this genus cause diseases
such as strep throat and pneumonia. They are shown here 900 times bigger
than their actual size.

</div>

Fungi are simple eukaryotic organisms that consist of one or more cells.
They include mushrooms and yeasts. Human diseases caused by fungi
include ringworm and athlete’s foot. Both are skin diseases that are not
usually serious. A ringworm infection is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wMi1yaW5nd29ybS1pbmZlY3Rpb24.) ). A
more serious fungus disease is histoplasmosis. It is a lung infection.
Though fungal infections can be annoying, they are rarely as serious or
deadly as bacterial or viral infections.

Ringworm isn’t a worm at all. It’s a disease caused by a fungus. The
fungus causes a ring-shaped rash on the skin, like the one shown here.

</div>

Protozoa are one-celled organisms with a nucleus, making them eukaryotic
organisms. They cause diseases such as malaria. Malaria is a serious
disease that is common in warm climates. The protozoa infect people when
they are bit by a mosquito. More than a million people die of malaria
each year. Other protozoa cause diarrhea. An example is *Giardia
lamblia* ( **Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wMy1naWFyZGlh)
).

This picture shows a one-celled organism called *Giardia lamblia* . It
is a protozoan that causes diarrhea.

</div>

Viruses are nonliving collections of protein and DNA that must reproduce
inside of living cells. Viruses cause many common diseases. For example,
viruses cause colds and the flu. Cold sores are caused by the virus
*Herpes simplex* ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wNC1IZXJwZXM.) ). Antibiotics do not
affect viruses, because antibiotics only kill bacteria. But medicines
called antiviral drugs can treat many diseases caused by viruses. Keep
in mind that viruses are nonliving, so can they be killed?

#### How Pathogens Spread {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IFBhdGhvZ2VucyBTcHJlYWQ._52-jc4}

Different pathogens spread in different ways. Some pathogens spread
through food. They cause food borne illnesses, which are discussed in a
previous concept. Some pathogens spread through water. *Giardia lamblia*
is one example. Water can be boiled to kill *Giardia* and most other
pathogens.

Several pathogens spread through sexual contact. HIV is one example,
which is discussed in the next concept. Other pathogens that spread
through sexual contact are discussed in a separate concept.

Many pathogens that cause respiratory diseases spread by droplets in the
air. Droplets are released when a person sneezes or coughs. Thousands of
tiny droplets are released when a person sneezes ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wNS1zbmVlemUtZHJvcGxldHM.) ). Each
droplet can contain thousands of pathogens. Viruses that cause colds and
the flu can spread in this way. You may get sick if you breathe in the
pathogens.

**Figure 12.108**

As this picture shows, thousands of tiny droplets are released into the
air when a person sneezes. Each droplet may carry thousands of
pathogens. You can’t normally see the droplets from a sneeze because
they are so small. However, you can breathe them in, along with any
pathogens they carry. This is how many diseases of the respiratory
system are spread.

</div>

#### Pathogens on Surfaces {#12.html#x-ck12-UGF0aG9nZW5z_52IG9uIFN1cmZhY2Vz-eb4}

Other pathogens spread when they get on objects or surfaces. A fungus
may spread in this way. For example, you can pick up the fungus that
causes athlete’s foot by wearing shoes that an infected person has worn.
You can also pick up this fungus from the floor of a public shower or
other damp areas. After acne, athlete’s foot is the most common skin
disease in the United States. Therefore, the chance of coming in contact
with the fungus in one of these ways is fairly high.

Bacteria that cause the skin disease impetigo, which causes blisters,
can spread when people share towels or clothes. The bacteria can also
spread through direct skin contact in sports like wrestling.

#### Pathogens and Vectors {#12.html#x-ck12-UGF0aG9nZW5z_52IGFuZCBWZWN0b3Jz-yf6}

Still other pathogens are spread by **vectors** . A vector is an
organism that carries pathogens from one person or animal to another.
Most vectors are insects, such as ticks and mosquitoes. These insects
tend to transfer protozoan or viral parasites. When an insect bites an
infected person or animal, it picks up the pathogen. Then the pathogen
travels to the next person or animal it bites. Ticks carry the bacteria
that cause Lyme disease. Mosquitoes ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wNi12ZWN0b3Jz) ) carry West Nile
virus. Both pathogens cause fever, headache, and tiredness. If the
diseases are not treated, more serious symptoms may develop. Other
diseases spread by mosquitoes include Dengue Fever and Yellow Fever.

Some diseases are spread by insects. The type of mosquito shown here can
spread West Nile virus. The virus doesn’t make the mosquito sick. The
mosquito just carries the virus from one person or animal to another.
The mosquito is a vector.

</div>

The first case of West Nile virus in North America occurred in 1999.
Within just a few years, the virus had spread throughout most of the
United States. Birds as well as humans can be infected with the virus.
Birds often fly long distances. This is one reason why West Nile virus
spread so quickly.

**What does a red ribbon symbolize?**

This red ribbon is a symbol for support of HIV-positive people and those
living with AIDS. As of 2010, an estimated 34 million people are living
with HIV worldwide.

### HIV Infection and AIDS {#12.html#x-ck12-SElWIEluZmVjdGlvbiBhbmQgQUlEUw.._53-iw3}

**HIV** , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. **AIDS** stands
for "acquired immune deficiency syndrome." It is a condition that causes
death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15
years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS
can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20
years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after
50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span.

#### How HIV Spreads {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IEhJViBTcHJlYWRz_53-kpg}

HIV spreads through contact between an infected person’s body fluids and
another person's bloodstream or mucus membranes, which are found in the
mouth, nose, and genital areas. Body fluids that may contain HIV are
blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast milk. The virus can spread
through sexual contact or shared drug needles. It can also spread from
an infected mother to her baby during childbirth or breastfeeding.
Saliva can carry the HIV virus, but it won't spread it, unless the
saliva gets into the bloodstream. Other body fluids such as urine and
sweat do not contain the virus. HIV does not spread in any fluid in
which the host cells cannot survive.

Some people think they can become infected with HIV by donating blood or
receiving donated blood. This is not true. The needles used to draw
blood for donations are always new. Therefore, they cannot spread the
virus. Donated blood is also tested to make sure it is does not contain
HIV.

HIV is not transmitted by day-to-day contact in the workplace, schools,
or social settings. HIV is not transmitted through shaking hands,
hugging, or a casual kiss. You cannot become infected from a toilet
seat, a drinking fountain, a door knob, dishes, drinking glasses, food,
or pets.

#### HIV and the Immune System {#12.html#x-ck12-SElWIGFuZCB0aGUgSW1tdW5lIFN5c3RlbQ.._53-i9l}

How does an HIV infection develop into AIDS? HIV destroys white blood
cells called **helper T cells** . The cells are produced by the immune
system. This is the body system that fights infections and other
diseases.

HIV invades helper T cells and uses them to produce more virus particles
( **Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfSElW) ). Then, the virus
kills the helper T cells. As the number of viruses in the blood rises,
the number of helper T cells falls. Without helper T cells, the immune
system is unable to protect the body. The infected person cannot fight
infections and other diseases because they do not have T cells. This is
why people do not die from HIV. Instead, they die from another illness,
like the common cold, that they cannot fight because they do not have
helper T cells.

Medications can slow down the increase of viruses in the blood. But the
medications cannot remove the viruses from the body. At present, there
is no cure for HIV infection. A vaccine against HIV could stop this
disease, and such a vaccine is in development, though it could take many
years before it can be given to prevent this virus.

#### AIDS {#12.html#x-ck12-QUlEUw.._53-mnt}

AIDS is not really a single disease. It is a set of symptoms and other
diseases. It results from years of damage to the immune system by HIV.
AIDS occurs when helper T cells fall to a very low level, making it
difficult for the affected person to fight various diseases and other
infections. These people develop infections or cancers that people with
a healthy immune systems can easily resist. These diseases are usually
the cause of death of people with AIDS.

The first known cases of AIDS occurred in 1981. Since then, AIDS has led
to the deaths of more than 35 million people worldwide. Many of them
were children. The greatest number of deaths occurred in Africa. It is
also where medications to control HIV are least available. There are
currently more people infected with HIV in Africa than any other part of
the world. Well over 30 million people are living with HIV worldwide.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._53-fy6}

-   HIV causes AIDS by destroying disease-fighting cells produced by the
    immune system.
-   HIV spreads through contact between an infected person’s body fluids
    and another person's bloodstream or mucus membranes; body fluids
    that may contain HIV include blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and
    breast milk.

**What is this girl doing to prevent the spread of the flu?**

Notice how this girl is covering her nose and mouth with a tissue as she
sneezes. This is a good habit that helps prevent her from passing on the
flu virus to other people. Notice she is also staying home and resting
instead of going out and possibly infecting others with her illness.

### Preventing Infectious Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBJbmZlY3Rpb3VzIERpc2Vhc2Vz_54-m3f}

**Infectious diseases** are diseases that spread from person to person.
They are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses or fungi. What
can you do to avoid infectious diseases? Eating right and getting plenty
of sleep are a good start. These habits will help keep your immune
system healthy. With a healthy immune system, you will be able to fight
off many pathogens. The next best way is to avoid pathogens. Though this
is difficult, there are steps you can take to limit your exposure to
pathogens.

Here are the ten best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

1.  Wash your hands frequently.
2.  Don't share personal items.
3.  Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
4.  Get vaccinated.
5.  Use safe cooking practices.
6.  Be a smart traveler.
7.  Practice safe sex.
8.  Don’t pick your nose (or your mouth or eyes either).
9.  Exercise caution with animals.
10. Watch the news, and be aware of disease outbreaks.

#### Avoiding Pathogens {#12.html#x-ck12-QXZvaWRpbmcgUGF0aG9nZW5z_54-qqh}

You can also take steps to avoid pathogens in the first place. The best
way to avoid pathogens is to wash your hands often. You should wash your
hands after using the bathroom or handling raw meat or fish. You should
also wash your hands before eating or preparing food. In addition, you
should also wash the food that your eat, and the utensils and countertop
where food is prepared. In addition, you should wash your hands after
being around sick people. The correct way to wash your hands is
demonstrated below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wOC1oYW5kLXdhc2hpbmc.) ). If soap and
water aren’t available, use some hand sanitizer.

**Figure 12.111**

This picture shows the proper way to wash your hands. Frequent hand
washing helps prevent the spread of pathogens.

</div>

The best way to prevent diseases spread by vectors is to avoid contact
with the vectors. Recall that a vector is an organism that carries
pathogens from one person or animal to another. For example, ticks and
mosquitoes are vectors, so you should wear long sleeves and long pants
when appropriate to avoid tick and mosquito bites. Using insect
repellent can also reduce your risk of insect bites.

Many infectious diseases can be prevented with vaccinations.
Immunization can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many
diseases. You will read more about vaccinations in another concept.
Vaccinations can help prevent measles, mumps, chicken pox, and several
other diseases.

If you do develop an infectious disease, try to avoid infecting others.
Stay home from school until you are well. Also, take steps to keep your
germs to yourself. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you
sneeze or cough, and wash your hands often to avoid spreading pathogens
to other people. Don't go to work or school if you're vomiting, have
diarrhea or are running a fever (and if you are, drink plenty of
fluids). Also, to avoid infectious diseases, don't share personal items;
use your own toothbrush, comb, and razor. And avoid sharing drinking
glasses or dining utensils.

Watching the news will allow you to make informed decisions. If an
outbreak of bad beef due to a bacterial infection is in the news, don't
buy beef for a while. If tomatoes are making people sick, don't eat
tomatoes until the outbreak is over. If a place has an unhealthy water
supply, boil the water or drink bottled water. Local news can tell you
of restaurants to avoid due to unhealthy conditions. And so on.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._54-qmi}

-   A healthy lifestyle and frequent hand washing can help reduce your
    risk of infectious diseases.
-   To avoid infecting others when you are sick, stay home from school,
    cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough,
    and wash your hands often.

**Why is tanning bad for your health?**

It might be fun to lay out in the sun like these two girls are doing.
But getting too much sun can be very dangerous. Overexposure to sunlight
raises your risk for skin cancer.

### Cancer {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2FuY2Vy_55-dui}

**Cancer** is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control.
Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of
control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is
usually caused by mutations. **Mutations** are random errors in genes.
Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the
cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide
uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A
**tumor** is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm
normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a
**carcinogen** . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.

#### Pathogens {#12.html#x-ck12-UGF0aG9nZW5z_55-vfa}

Pathogens that cause cancer include the human papilloma virus (HPV) (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0wOS1IUFY.) ) and the
hepatitis B virus. HPV is spread through sexual contact. It can cause
cancer of the reproductive system in females. The hepatitis B virus is
spread through sexual contact or contact with blood containing the
virus. It can cause cancer of the liver.

The mutations that cause cancer may occur when people are exposed to
pathogens, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is shown here.

#### Chemicals {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWxz_55-cqb}

Many different chemical substances cause cancer. Dozens of chemicals in
tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xMC1jaGVtaWNhbC1jYXJpbm9nZW5z) ). In
fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens.
Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat,
and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other
chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene,
cadmium, and nickel.

#### Radiation {#12.html#x-ck12-UmFkaWF0aW9u_55-3ez}

Forms of radiation that cause cancer include ultraviolet (UV) radiation
and radon ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xMS1yYWRpYXRpb24.) ). **UV
radiation** is part of sunlight. It is the leading cause of skin cancer.
**Radon** is a natural radioactive gas that seeps into buildings from
the ground. It can cause lung cancer.

#### Common Types of Cancer {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29tbW9uIFR5cGVzIG9mIENhbmNlcg.._55-rpl}

Cancer is usually found in adults, especially in adults over the age of
50. The most common type of cancer in adult males is cancer of the
prostate gland. The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive
system. Prostate cancer makes up about one third of all cancers in men.
The most common type of cancer in adult females is breast cancer. It
makes up about one third of all cancers in women. In both men and women,
lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer. Most cases of lung
cancer happen in people who smoke.

Cancer can also be found in children. But childhood cancer is rare.
Leukemia is the main type of cancer in children. It makes up about one
third of all childhood cancers. It happens when the body makes abnormal
white blood cells.

Sometimes cancer cells break away from a tumor. If they enter the
bloodstream, they are carried throughout the body. Then, the cells may
start growing in other tissues. This is usually how cancer spreads from
one part of the body to another. Once this happens, cancer is very hard
to stop or control.

#### Treating Cancer {#12.html#x-ck12-VHJlYXRpbmcgQ2FuY2Vy_55-8ci}

If leukemia is treated early, it usually can be cured. In fact, many
cancers can be cured, which is known as remission, if treated early.
Treatment of cancer often involves removing a tumor with surgery. This
may be followed by other types of treatments. These treatments may
include drugs (known as chemotherapy) and radiation therapy, which kill
cancer cells.

The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. This is
why it is important to know the warning signs of cancer. Having warning
signs does not mean that you have cancer. However, you should see a
doctor to be sure. Everyone should know the warning signs of cancer.
Detecting and treating cancer early can often lead to a cure. Some
warning signs of cancer include:

-   Change in bowel or bladder habits.
-   Sores that do not heal.
-   Unusual bleeding or discharge.
-   Lump in the breast or elsewhere.
-   Chronic indigestion.
-   Difficulty swallowing.
-   Obvious changes in a wart or mole.
-   Persistent cough or hoarseness.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._55-23w}

-   Cancer is caused by mutations, which can be caused by pathogens,
    chemicals, or radiation.
-   Cancer can be treated with surgery, drugs, and radiation.

**What do these foods have in common?**

These foods are all high in sugar. A person with diabetes has to avoid
these types of foods.

### Diabetes {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlhYmV0ZXM._56-uka}

**Diabetes** is a non-infectious disease in which the body is unable to
control the amount of sugar in the blood. People with diabetes have high
blood sugar, either because their bodies do not produce enough insulin,
or because their cells do not respond to insulin. **Insulin** is a
hormone that helps cells take up sugar from the blood. Without enough
insulin, the blood contains too much sugar. This can damage blood
vessels and other cells throughout the body. The kidneys work hard to
filter out and remove some of the extra sugar. This leads to frequent
urination and excessive thirst.

There are two main types of diabetes, type 1 diabetes and type 2
diabetes. Type 1 diabetes makes up about 5-10% of all cases of diabetes
in the United States. Type 2 diabetes accounts for most of the other
cases. Both types of diabetes are more likely in people that have
certain genes. Having a family member with diabetes increases the risk
of developing the disease.

Either type of diabetes can increase the chances of having other health
problems. For example, people with diabetes are more likely to develop
heart disease and kidney disease. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are similar
in these ways. However, the two types of diabetes have different causes.

#### Type 1 Diabetes {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZSAxIERpYWJldGVz_56-feh}

**Type 1 diabetes** occurs when the immune system attacks normal cells
of the pancreas. Since the cells in the pancreas are damaged, the
pancreas cannot make insulin. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in
childhood or adolescence.

People with type 1 diabetes must frequently check the sugar in their
blood. They use a meter to monitor their blood sugar ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xMi1CbG9vZC1zdWdhci1tZXRlcg..) ).
Whenever their blood sugar starts to get too high, they need a shot of
insulin. The insulin brings their blood sugar back to normal. There is
no cure for type 1 diabetes. Therefore, insulin shots must be taken for
life. Most people with this type of diabetes learn how to give
themselves insulin shots.

#### Type 2 Diabetes {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZSAyIERpYWJldGVz_56-rvr}

**Type 2 diabetes** occurs when body cells are no longer sensitive to
insulin. The pancreas may still make insulin, but the cells of the body
cannot use it efficiently. Being overweight and having high blood
pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. Type 2
diabetes usually develops in adulthood, but it is becoming more common
in teens and children. This is because more young people are overweight,
due to a high sugar and fat diet, now than ever before.

Some cases of type 2 diabetes can be cured with weight loss. However,
most people with the disease need to take medicine to control their
blood sugar. Regular exercise and balanced eating also help, and should
be a regular part of the treatment for these people. Like people with
type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes must frequently check their
blood sugar.

#### Symptoms {#12.html#x-ck12-U3ltcHRvbXM._56-isf}

Common symptoms of diabetes include the following:

-   frequent urination
-   feeling very thirsty
-   feeling very hungry, even though you are eating
-   extreme fatigue
-   blurry vision
-   cuts or bruises that are slow to heal
-   weight loss, even though you are eating more (type 1)
-   tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands or feet (type 2)

#### Complications {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGxpY2F0aW9ucw.._56-9g8}

Complications of diabetes can include the following:

-   eye complications
-   foot complications
-   skin complications
-   high blood pressure
-   hearing issues
-   nerve damage
-   kidney disease
-   artery disease
-   stroke
-   stress

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._56-cyl}

-   In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, the
    hormone that helps take up sugar from the blood.
-   In type 2 diabetes, the body cells cannot use insulin properly.

**Does pollen make you sneeze?**

If so, you are not alone. It is one of the most common allergies. The
runny nose and sneezing associated with allergies results from the
immune system working improperly.

### Diseases of the Immune System {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlzZWFzZXMgb2YgdGhlIEltbXVuZSBTeXN0ZW0._57-npv}

The immune system usually protects you from pathogens and other causes
of disease. When the immune system is working properly, it keeps you
from getting sick. But the immune system is like any other system of the
body. It can break down or develop diseases.

AIDS is an infectious disease of the immune system caused by a virus.
Some diseases of the immune system are noninfectious. They include
autoimmune diseases and allergies.

#### Autoimmune Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-QXV0b2ltbXVuZSBEaXNlYXNlcw.._57-byn}

Does it make sense for an immune system to attack the cells it is meant
to protect? No, but an immune system that does not function properly
will attack its own cells. An **autoimmune disease** is a disease in
which the immune system attacks the body’s own cells.

One example is **type 1 diabetes** . In this disease, the immune system
attacks cells of the pancreas. Other examples are multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis. In **multiple sclerosis** , the immune system
attacks nerve cells. This causes weakness and pain. In **rheumatoid
arthritis** , the immune system attacks the cells of joints. This causes
joint damage and pain.

Autoimmune diseases cannot be cured. But they can be helped with
medicines that weaken the immune system’s attack on normal cells. Other
autoimmune diseases include celiac disease (damages to the small
intestine), inflammatory bowel disease (damage to the digestive tract),
psoriasis (damage to the skin), and lupus (damage to the joints, skin,
kidneys, heart, and lungs).

#### Allergies {#12.html#x-ck12-QWxsZXJnaWVz_57-8we}

An **allergy** occurs when the immune system attacks a harmless
substance that enters the body from the outside. A substance that causes
an allergy is called an allergen. It is the immune system, not the
allergen, that causes the symptoms of an allergy.

Did you ever hear of hay fever? It’s not really a fever at all. It’s an
allergy to plant pollens. People with this type of allergy have symptoms
such as watery eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. A common cause of hay
fever is the pollen of ragweed. Many people are also allergic to poison
ivy ( **Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xNC1wb2lzb24taXZ5)
). Skin contact with poison ivy leads to an itchy rash in people who are
allergic to the plant.

Poison ivy plants are wild vines with leaves in groups of three. They
grow in wooded areas in most of the United States. Contact with poison

</div>

Some people are allergic to certain foods. Nuts and shellfish are common
causes of food allergies. Other common causes of allergies include:

-   Drugs, such as penicillin.
-   Mold.
-   Dust.
-   The dead skin cells of dogs and cats, called dander.
-   Stings of wasps and bees.

Most allergies can be treated with medicines. Medicines used to treat
allergies include antihistamines and corticosteroids. These medicines
help control the immune system when it attacks an allergen. Sometimes,
allergies cause severe symptoms, a condition known as anaphylaxis‎. For
example, they may cause the throat to swell so it is hard to breathe.
Severe allergies may be life threatening. They require emergency medical
care.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._57-3yo}

-   Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks normal
    body cells.
-   Allergies occur when the immune system attacks harmless substances
    that enter the body from the outside.

**How can you reduce your risk of developing cancer?**

You can reduce your risk of developing cancer by staying away from
certain hazards. For example, the use of tanning beds can lead to skin
cancer.

### Preventing Noninfectious Diseases {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBOb25pbmZlY3Rpb3VzIERpc2Vhc2Vz_58-wcz}

Noninfectious diseases can't be passed from one person to another.
Instead, these types of diseases are caused by factors such as the
environment, genetics, and lifestyle. Examples of inherited
noninfectious conditions include cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome. If
you're born with these conditions, you must learn how to manage the
symptoms. Examples of conditions caused by environmental or lifestyle
factors include heart disease and skin cancer. We can't change our
genetic codes, but there are plenty of ways to prevent other
noninfectious diseases. For example, cutting down on exposure to
cigarette smoke and the sun's rays will prevent certain types of cancer.

It is a fact that most chronic noninfectious diseases can be prevented.
The chronic noninfectious diseases that cause the most deaths in many
developed countries are largely preventable. These diseases are heart
disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer, and though they do have some
genetic components, they also have many lifestyle components. For
example, some cancers have genetic risks, but people at high risk for
cancers can have screening examinations to catch them early or sometimes
can take other steps to prevent the cancers. Heart disease, stroke and
diabetes are mostly linked to lifestyle choices, even when family
history puts a person at higher risk for the diseases.

Most allergies can be prevented by avoiding the substances that cause
them. For example, you can avoid pollens by staying indoors as much as
possible. You can learn to recognize plants like poison ivy and not
touch them. A good way to remember how to avoid poison ivy is "leaves of
three, let it be." Some people receive allergy shots to help prevent
allergic reactions. The shots contain tiny amounts of allergens, which
are the substances that cause an allergic reaction. After many months or
years of shots, the immune system gets used to the allergens and no
longer responds to them.

Type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented. But
choosing a healthy lifestyle can help prevent type 2 diabetes. Getting
plenty of exercise, avoiding high-fat foods, and staying at a healthy
weight can reduce the risk of developing this type of diabetes. This is
especially important for people who have family members with the
disease.

Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types
of cancer. In addition, you can lower the risk of cancer by avoiding
**carcinogens** , which are substances that cause cancer. For example,
you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by not smoking. You can reduce
your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen
that offers the most protection is explained below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xNS1TdW5zY3JlZW4.) ). Some people
think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth.
Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV
radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether
the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun.

Overall, people in many developed countries are contributing to higher
rates of noninfectious diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes and
cancer) by taking advantage of technology and social environments that
encourage a less active lifestyle, and also encourages faster and
cheaper meals. For example, many children now spend more time on their
computer or watching TV then playing outdoors. The "faster and cheaper"
meals are usually less healthy than other meals. Even though many people
are living longer, they can choose to live more healthily by adopting
regular exercise routines and healthy eating habits.

**What is your nose good for?**

Your nose does a lot of work for you! Obviously, it helps you breathe
and provides your sense of smell. But you might not realize that your
nose also helps to fight off disease.

### The Immune System's First Line of Defense {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEltbXVuZSBTeXN0ZW0ncyBGaXJzdCBMaW5lIG9mIERlZmVuc2U._59-5m9}

It is the immune system's job to protect the body. Your body has many
ways to protect you from pathogens. Your body’s defenses are like a
castle. The outside of a castle was protected by a moat and high walls.
Inside the castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any enemies that
made it across the moat and over the walls. Like a castle, your body has
a series of defenses. Only pathogens that get through all the defenses
can harm you.

The first line of defence includes both physical and chemical barriers
that are always ready and prepared to defend the body from infection.
Pathogens must make it past this first line of defense to cause harm. If
this defense is broken, the second line of defense within your body is
activated.

Your body’s first line of defense is like a castle’s moat and walls. It
keeps most pathogens out of your body. This is a non-specific type of
defense, in that it tries to keep all pathogens out. The first line of
defense includes different types of barriers. Being the "first line", it
starts with the skin. The first line also includes tears, mucus, cilia,
stomach acid, urine flow, and friendly bacteria.

#### Skin and Mucous Membranes {#12.html#x-ck12-U2tpbiBhbmQgTXVjb3VzIE1lbWJyYW5lcw.._59-ulf}

The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. The skin is the
body’s largest organ. In adults, it covers an area of about 16 to 22
square feet! The skin is also the body’s most important defense against
disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside
world. The skin has several layers that stack on top of each other (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xNi1Ta2luLWxheWVy) ). The
outer layer is tough and waterproof. It is very difficult for pathogens
to get through this layer of skin.

![The skin's many layers helps keep most pathogens
out](ck12_12_files/20150911113756338150.jpeg "The skin's many layers helps keep most pathogens out")

**Figure 12.119**

This drawing shows that the skin has many layers. The outer layer is so
tough that it keeps out most pathogens.

</div>

The mouth and nose are not lined with skin. Instead, they are lined with
**mucous membranes** . Other organs that are exposed to the outside
world, including the lungs and stomach, are also lined with mucous
membranes. Mucous membranes are not tough like skin, but they have other
defenses.

One defense of mucous membranes is the mucus they release. **Mucus** is
a sticky, moist substance that covers mucous membranes. Most pathogens
get stuck in the mucus before they can do harm to the body. Many mucous
membranes also have cilia. Cilia in the lungs are pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xNy1jaWxpYQ..) ).
**Cilia** are tiny finger-like projections. They move in waves and sweep
mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. When you clear your
throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body.

**Figure 12.120**

This is what the cilia lining the lungs look like when they are
magnified. Their movements constantly sweep mucus and pathogens out of
the lungs. Do they remind you of brushes?

</div>

#### Chemicals {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWxz_59-zso}

Most body fluids that you release from your body contain chemicals that
kill pathogens. For example, mucus, sweat, tears, and saliva contain
enzymes called lysozymes that kill pathogens. These enzymes can break
down the cell walls of bacteria to kill them.

The stomach also releases a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid.
This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water.
Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens can grow in it.

#### Helpful Bacteria {#12.html#x-ck12-SGVscGZ1bCBCYWN0ZXJpYQ.._59-gsi}

You are not aware of them, but your skin is covered by millions (or
more!) of bacteria. Millions more live inside your body. Most of these
bacteria help defend your body from pathogens. How do they do it? They
compete with harmful bacteria for food and space. This prevents the
harmful bacteria from multiplying and making you sick.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._59-ifg}

-   Your body’s first line of defense includes the skin and other
    barriers that keep pathogens out of your body.

**Have you ever sprained your ankle?**

Did you notice redness and swelling near the injury? These symptoms
indicate that your body is attempting to fight off infection.

### The Immune System's Second Line of Defense {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEltbXVuZSBTeXN0ZW0ncyBTZWNvbmQgTGluZSBvZiBEZWZlbnNl_60-vui}

The little girl pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0xOC1zY3JhcGVkLWtuZWU.) ) has a
scraped knee. A scrape is a break in the skin that may let pathogens
enter the body. If bacteria enter through the scrape, they could cause
an infection. These bacteria would then face the body’s second line of
defense. The second line of defense is also nonspecific, fighting many
types of pathogens.

#### Inflammation {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5mbGFtbWF0aW9u_60-6kh}

The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the
inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the
area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation.
**Inflammation** is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries.
Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other
tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate,
or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes
the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood
cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of
blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

#### White Blood Cells {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hpdGUgQmxvb2QgQ2VsbHM._60-nyl}

What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation? The main
role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body. There are
actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood
cells have very specific functions. They attack only certain pathogens.
Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find. These white blood
cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed. They are called
**phagocytes** , which means “eating cells.” Neutrophils are a type of
phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes “eat” dead cells. They
surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the
phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it. This process is
called **phagocytosis** .

White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A **fever** is
a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is
98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce
fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the
pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature
to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white
blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._60-n8z}

-   If pathogens enter your body, inflammation occurs.
-   White blood cells called phagocytes travel to areas of the body that
    are inflamed.

**Do you still have your tonsils?**

Many people have their tonsils removed because they can hold on to germs
that cause throat infections. Although sometimes they can do more harm
than good, tonsils are there to help you. They trap pathogens so that
they can be destroyed before they enter farther into your body.

### The Lymphatic System and the Immune Response {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEx5bXBoYXRpYyBTeXN0ZW0gYW5kIHRoZSBJbW11bmUgUmVzcG9uc2U._61-dw1}

If pathogens get through the body’s first two lines of defense, a third
line of defense takes over. This third line of defense involves the
immune system. It is called an **immune response** , and is a specific
type of response. The immune system has a special response for each type
of pathogen.

The **immune system** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0yMC1pbW11bmUtc3lzdGVt) ) is also part
of the lymphatic system—named for **lymphocytes** , which are the type
of white blood cells involved in an immune response. They include
several lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes.

#### Lymph and Lymph Vessels {#12.html#x-ck12-THltcGggYW5kIEx5bXBoIFZlc3NlbHM._61-nsp}

Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the
cardiovascular system, which you can read about in a previous concept.
Lymph vessels are like blood vessels, except they move lymph instead of
blood. **Lymph** is a yellowish liquid that leaks out of tiny blood
vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. Where there is more
inflammation, there is usually more lymph in tissues. This lymph may
contain many pathogens.

The lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph
vessels. It then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Lymph is
not pumped through lymph vessels like blood is pumped through blood
vessels by the heart. Instead, muscles around the lymph vessels contract
and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also
contract to help move the lymph along. The lymph finally reaches the
main lymph vessels in the chest. Here, the lymph drains into two large
veins. This is how the lymph returns to the bloodstream.

Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, pathogens are removed from it at
lymph nodes. **Lymph nodes** are small, oval structures located along
the lymph vessels. They act like filters. Any pathogens filtered out of
the lymph at lymph nodes are destroyed by lymphocytes in the nodes.

#### Lymphocytes {#12.html#x-ck12-THltcGhvY3l0ZXM._61-rm2}

Lymphocytes ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0yNS1seW1waG9jeXRl) ), a type of white
blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response. There are trillions
of lymphocytes in the human body. They make up about one quarter of all
white blood cells. Usually, fewer than half of the body’s lymphocytes
are in the blood. The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph
organs.

**Figure 12.124**

This image of a lymphocyte was made with an electron microscope. The
lymphocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size.

</div>

There are two main types of lymphocytes:

1.  B cells.
2.  T cells.

Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are
named for the sites where they grow larger. The "B" in B cells stands
for “bone.” B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The "T" in T cells
stands for “thymus.” T cells mature in the thymus gland.

B and T cells must be “switched on” in order to fight a specific
pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to
fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific
pathogens? Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface.
These proteins are called antigens. An **antigen** is any protein that
causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the
body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other
pathogens. Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong
in your body.

**What happens when your body recognizes an invader?**

When your immune system detects an invading pathogen, it goes on the
attack! Notice how this T-cell is setting out to destroy a cancer cell.

### B and T Cell Response {#12.html#x-ck12-QiBhbmQgVCBDZWxsIFJlc3BvbnNl_62-uxu}

Some defenses, like your skin and mucous membranes, are not designed to
ward off a specific pathogen. They are just general defenders against
disease. Your body also has defenses that are more specialized. Through
the help of your immune system, your body can generate an army of cells
to kill that one specific pathogen.

There are two different types of specific immune responses. One type
involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. Recall that **B
cells** and **T cells** are types of white blood cells that are key in
the immune response. Whereas the immune system's first and second line
of defense are more generalized or non-specific, the immune response is
specific. It can be described as a specific response to a specific
pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one pathogen at a time.
These methods involve B and T cells.

#### B Cell Response {#12.html#x-ck12-QiBDZWxsIFJlc3BvbnNl_62-aoe}

B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in
the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies.
An **antibody** is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an
**antigen** , a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are
found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign
microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of
antigen ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0yNi1hbnRpYm9keS1hbnRpZ2VuLWJpbmRpbmc.)
). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody
bind together, they signal for a **phagocyte** to destroy them.
Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by
phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the
pathogen is destroyed by this process.

At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can
react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there
can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body.

This diagram shows how an antibody binds with an antigen. The antibody

Antibodies produced by different B cells bind with other types of
antigens. The antigen-binding sites can vary, such that they are
specific for just one antigen.

</div>

#### T Cell Response {#12.html#x-ck12-VCBDZWxsIFJlc3BvbnNl_62-m5w}

There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and
helper T cells. **Killer T cells** destroy infected, damaged, or
cancerous body cells ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMS0yNy1raWxsZXItVGNlbGwtYW5kLXZpcnVz) ).
When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it
releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of
the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected
cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed.

In this diagram, a killer T cell recognizes a body cell infected with a
virus. After the killer T cell makes contact with the infected cell, it

</div>

**Helper T cells** do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But
they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing
chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by
helper T cells “switch on” both B cells and killer T cells so they can
recognize and fight specific pathogens.

**Is this child more fortunate than many children?**

You may not feel lucky to get a shot. But you are very lucky to be able
to get vaccinations. In many parts of the world, children do not get
routine vaccinations. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO)
estimated that 1.5 million children under the age of 5 died from
diseases that are preventable with vaccinations.

### Immunity and Vaccination {#12.html#x-ck12-SW1tdW5pdHkgYW5kIFZhY2NpbmF0aW9u_63-z9z}

In previous concepts, you learned about B and T cells, special types of
white blood cells that help your body to fight off a specific pathogen.
They are necessary when the body is fighting off an infection. But what
happens to them after the pathogen has been destroyed?

Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under
control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive
for a person’s lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called
memory cells. They allow the immune system to “remember” the pathogen
after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the
memory cells will start dividing in order to fight the pathogen or
disease.

These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to
fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the
first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system
will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection.
Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called **immunity** .

Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. **Vaccination** is the
process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to
develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually
injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is
injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but
the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing
the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the
injected antigen. The body prepares "memory" cells for use at a later
time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a
vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without
making a person sick.

In many countries, children receive their first vaccination at birth
with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants from Hepatitis B, a
serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases
that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio.
Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now protected by
vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you
have probably been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and
chicken pox.

**Why do men and women look different?**

The features that make men unique from women, such as this man's beard,
are controlled by the sex hormones. The production of the sex hormones
is a key role of the male reproductive system.

### The Male Reproductive System Functions {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1hbGUgUmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlIFN5c3RlbSBGdW5jdGlvbnM._64-m1v}

Dogs have puppies. Cats have kittens. All organisms reproduce, obviously
including humans. Like other mammals, humans have a body system that
controls reproduction. It is called the **reproductive system** . It is
the only human body system that is very different in males and females.
The male and female reproductive systems have different organs and
different functions.

The male reproductive system has two main functions:

1.  Producing sperm.
2.  Releasing testosterone into the body.

**Sperm** are male **gametes** , or reproductive cells. When a male
gamete meets a female gamete, they can form a new organism. Sperm form
when certain cells in the male reproductive system divide by **meiosis**
, resulting in cells with half the amount of DNA as a regular "body"
cell. More precisely, sperm cells are haploid sex cells, having one set
of chromosomes. Regular body cells are diploid, having two set of
chromosomes. As there are 46 chromosomes in a diploid human cell, how
many are in a human sperm cell?

When males grow older, they produce millions of sperm each day. The male
reproductive system also maintains and transports and delivers sperm and
a protective fluid, known as semen.

**Testosterone** is the main sex hormone in males. Hormones are
chemicals that control many body processes. Testosterone has two major
roles:

-   During the teen years, testosterone causes the reproductive organs
    to mature. It also causes other male traits to develop. For example,
    it causes hair to grow on the face and allows for muscle growth.
-   During adulthood, testosterone helps a man to produce sperm.

When a hormone is released into the body, we say it is "secreted."
Testosterone is secreted by males, but it is not the only sex hormone
that males secrete. Males also secrete small amounts of estrogen. Even
though estrogen is the main female sex hormone, scientists think that
estrogen is needed for normal sperm production in males.

**What organs are unique to the male body?**

Men and women share most of the same organs. We all have skin, a heart,
and lungs. Men and women differ only in their reproductive organs.

### Male Reproductive Organs {#12.html#x-ck12-TWFsZSBSZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUgT3JnYW5z_65-wpz}

The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, and epididymis (
**Figure**

**Figure 12.128**

This drawing shows the organs of the male reproductive system. It shows
the organs from the side. Find each organ in the drawing as you read
about it in the text.

</div>

-   The **penis** is a cylinder-shaped organ. It contains the urethra.
    The **urethra** is a tube that carries urine out of the body. The
    urethra also carries sperm out of the body.

<!-- -->

-   The two **testes** (singular, testis) are egg-shaped organs. They
    produce sperm and secrete testosterone. The testes are found inside
    of the scrotum. The **scrotum** is a sac that hangs down outside
    the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. The testes,
    being in the scrotum outside the body, allow the temperature of the
    sperm to be maintained at a few degrees lower than body temperature.
    This is necessary for the stability of these reproductive cells.

<!-- -->

-   The **epididymis** is a tube that is about six meters (20 feet) long
    in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum. It
    rests on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm grow
    larger and mature. The epididymis also stores sperm until they leave
    the body. 

Other parts of the male reproductive system include the vas deferens and
the prostate gland. Both of these structures are pictured below (
**Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wMS1NYWxlLXJlcHJvZHVjdGl2ZS1wYXJ0cw..)
).

-   The **vas deferens** is a tube that carries sperm from the
    epididymis to the urethra.
-   The **prostate gland** secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to
    help form semen. The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. 
    **Semen** is a "milky" liquid that carries sperm through the urethra
    and out of the body. In addition to sperm cells, semen contains
    sugars (fructose) which provide energy to the sperm cells, and
    enzymes and other substances which help the sperm survive.

**How many sperm does it take to fertilize an egg?**

It might only take one sperm to fertilize an egg, but that sperm is not
alone. Hundreds of millions of sperm can be released during sexual
intercourse.

This drawing of a sperm shows its main parts. What is the role of each
part? How do you think the shape of the sperm might help it swim?

</div>

#### Sperm {#12.html#x-ck12-U3Blcm0._66-sxu}

A sperm has three main parts:

1.  The head of the sperm contains the nucleus. The **nucleus** holds
    the DNA of the cell. The head also contains enzymes that help the
    sperm break through the cell membrane of an egg.
2.  The midpiece of the sperm is packed with mitochondria.
    **Mitochondria** are organelles in cells that produce energy. Sperm
    use the energy in the midpiece to move.
3.  The tail of the sperm moves like a propeller, around and around.
    This tail is a long flagella that pushes the sperm forward. A sperm
    can travel about 30 inches per hour. This may not sound very fast,
    but don’t forget how small a sperm is. For its size, a sperm moves
    about as fast as you do when you walk briskly.

#### Sperm Production {#12.html#x-ck12-U3Blcm0gUHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._66-hlb}

To make sperm, cells start in the testes and end in the epididymis. It
takes up to two months to make sperm. The steps are explained below:

1.  Special cells in the testes go through **mitosis** (cell division)
    to make identical copies of themselves.
2.  The copies of the original cells divide by **meiosis** , producing
    cells called **spermatids** . The spermatids have half the number of
    chromosomes as the original cell. The spermatids are immature and
    cannot move on their own.
3.  The spermatids are transported from the testes to the epididymis.
    Involuntary muscular contraction moves the spermatids along.
4.  In the **epididymis** , spermatids slowly grow older and mature.
    They grow a tail. They also lose some of the cytoplasm from
    the head. It is here that the spermatids mature, becoming
    sperm cells.
5.  When sperm are mature, they can “swim.” The mature sperm are stored
    in the epididymis until it is time for them to leave the body.

Sperm leave the epididymis through the **vas deferens** . As they travel
through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands.
The sperm mix with liquids from these glands, forming **semen** . The
semen travels through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis.
A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as 500 million sperm!

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._66-wmp}

-   Sperm are male gametes that form in the testes and mature in
    the epididymis.
-   The head of the sperm contains the nucleus, the midpiece is packed
    with mitochondria, and the tail moves like a propeller.

**What causes a girl to develop into a woman?**

Adult female characteristics, such as breasts, develop during the teen
years. What causes this to happen? The development of the female traits
is caused by the hormones produced by the female reproductive system.

### The Female Reproductive System Functions {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZlbWFsZSBSZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUgU3lzdGVtIEZ1bmN0aW9ucw.._67-sua}

Most of the male reproductive organs are outside of the body. But female
reproductive organs are inside of the body. The male and female organs
also look very different and have different jobs. Two of the functions
of the female reproductive system are similar to the functions of the
male reproductive system. The female system:

1.  Produces **gametes** , the reproductive cells, which are called eggs
    in females.
2.  Secretes a major sex hormone, estrogen.

One of the main roles of the female reproductive system is to produce
eggs. **Eggs** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfaHVtYW5lZ2c.) ) are female gametes, and
they are made in the ovaries. After puberty, females release only one
egg at a time. Eggs are actually made in the body before birth, but they
do not fully develop until later in life. Like sperm, eggs are produced
by meiosis, so they contain half the number of chromosomes as the
original cell.

Another role of the female system is to secrete estrogen. **Estrogen**
is the main sex hormone in females. Estrogen has two major roles:

1.  During the teen years, estrogen causes the reproductive organs
    to develop. It also causes other female traits to develop. For
    example, it causes the breasts to grow.
2.  During adulthood, estrogen is needed for a woman to release eggs. On
    average, a woman releases one egg each month from her ovaries.

The female reproductive system has another important function. After
puberty, the female reproductive system must prepare itself to accept a
fertilized egg each cycle (about every month). This cycle is controlled
by a well-planned and very complex interplay of hormones. If an egg is
not fertilized, the system must prepare itself again the next cycle. The
female reproductive system also supports a baby as it develops before
birth, and it facilitates the baby's birth at the end of pregnancy.

-   The functions of the female reproductive system are to produce eggs,
    secrete estrogen, and support a baby as it develops before birth.
-   Estrogen, the main sex hormone in females, causes the female traits
    and reproductive organs to develop and is needed for the release

**Where are the female reproductive organs?**

Unlike the male reproductive organs, much of the female reproductive
organs are internal. This allows them to be well-protected by the body.

### Female Reproductive Organs {#12.html#x-ck12-RmVtYWxlIFJlcHJvZHVjdGl2ZSBPcmdhbnM._68-tud}

The female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, fallopian
tubes, and ovaries ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wNC1GZW1hbGVfUmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlLXN0cnVjdHVyZQ..)
). The breasts are not shown in this figure. They are not considered
reproductive organs, even though they are involved in reproduction. They
contain mammary glands that give milk to feed a baby. The milk leaves
the breast through the nipple when the baby sucks on it.

**Figure 12.131**

This drawing shows the organs of the female reproductive system. It
shows the organs from the side. Find each organ in the drawing as you

</div>

-   The **vagina** is a cylinder-shaped organ found inside of the
    female body. One end of the vagina opens at the outside of the body.
    The other end joins with the uterus. During sexual intercourse,
    sperm may be released into the vagina. If this occurs, the sperm
    will move through the vagina and into the uterus. During birth, a
    baby passes from the uterus to the vagina to leave the body.

<!-- -->

-   The **uterus** is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The part that
    connects the vagina with the uterus is called the **cervix** . The
    uterus is where a baby develops until birth. The walls of the uterus
    grow bigger as the baby grows. The muscular walls of the uterus push
    the baby out during birth.

<!-- -->

-   The two **ovaries** are small, oval organs on either side of
    the uterus. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs, with about 1-2
    million immature eggs present at birth and 40,000 immature eggs
    present at puberty, as most of the eggs die off. The eggs do not
    fully develop until a female has gone through puberty. About once a
    month, on average one egg completes development and is released by
    the ovary. The ovaries also secrete **estrogen** , the main female
    sex hormone.

<!-- -->

-   The two **fallopian tubes** are narrow tubes that open off from
    the uterus. Each tube reaches for one of the ovaries, but the tubes
    are not attached to the ovaries. The end of each fallopian tube by
    the ovary has “fingers” ( **Figure**
    [above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wNC1GZW1hbGVfUmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlLXN0cnVjdHVyZQ..) ).
    They sweep an egg into the fallopian tube. Then the egg passes
    through the fallopian tube to the uterus. If an egg is to be
    fertilized, this will occur in the fallopian tube. A fertilized egg
    then implants into the wall of the uterus, where it begins
    to develop. An unfertilized egg will flow through the uterus and be
    excreted from the body.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._68-6eu}

**How is egg different from sperm?**

Egg and sperm are both gametes, or reproductive cells. Notice how
different they are, however. The egg is much larger than the sperm. The
egg also does not have a tail. And the female only releases one egg at
time, while the male releases millions of sperm at a time.

### Eggs and Egg Production {#12.html#x-ck12-RWdncyBhbmQgRWdnIFByb2R1Y3Rpb24._69-ofi}

When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will
ever produce. But these eggs are not fully developed. They develop only
after she starts having menstrual periods at about age 12 or 13. Just
one egg develops each month. A woman will release an egg once each month
until she is in her 40s. A girl is born with over a million eggs. They
die off and by puberty about 40,000 remain.

#### Eggs {#12.html#x-ck12-RWdncw.._69-y9d}

Eggs are very big cells. In fact, they are the biggest cells in the
human female body. (How many egg cells are in the human male body?) An
egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell! You can even see an egg
cell without a microscope. Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus
with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells. Unlike a sperm
cell, the egg contains a lot of **cytoplasm** , the contents of the
cell, which is why it is so big. The egg also does not have a tail.

#### Egg Production {#12.html#x-ck12-RWdnIFByb2R1Y3Rpb24._69-kei}

Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It takes several steps to
make an egg:

1.  Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through **mitosis**
    (cell division), producing identical cells.
2.  The daughter cells then start to divide by **meiosis** . But they
    only go through the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at
    that time. They go through the second stage of cell division after
    the female goes through puberty.
3.  In a mature female, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month.
    The drawing below shows how this happens ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wNS1lZ2ctZm9sbGljbGUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ.) ).

As you can see from the figure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called
a **follicle** . The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other
changes. The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary.

After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through
the wall of the ovary. This is called **ovulation** , which usually
occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle. In a 28 day cycle, ovulation
would occur around day 14. The moving fingers of the nearby **fallopian
tube**  then sweep the egg into the tube. At this time, if sperm are
present the egg can be fertilized.

**Figure 12.132**

This diagram shows how an egg and its follicle develop in an ovary.
After it develops, the egg leaves the ovary and enters the fallopian
tube. (1) Undeveloped eggs, (2) Egg and follicle developing, (3) Egg and
follicle developing, (4) Ovulation. After ovulation, what remains of the
follicle is known as the corpus luteum, which degenerates (5, 6).

</div>

Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing
through the fallopian tube. When this happens, the egg finally completes
meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that are different in size.
The smaller cell is called a **polar body** . It contains very little
cytoplasm. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the
egg. It contains most of the cytoplasm. This will develop into a child.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._69-zxh}

-   Eggs are female gametes that form in the ovaries and are released
    into the fallopian tubes.
-   The eggs are formed before a baby girl is born, but these eggs are
    not fully developed.

**What happens during the menstrual cycle?**

When you think of the menstrual cycle, you probably think of the
discharge of blood that happens during menstruation. This is only one
small part of the female monthly cycle, however.

### The Female Monthly Cycle {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZlbWFsZSBNb250aGx5IEN5Y2xl_70-vap}

The **menstrual cycle** is a series of changes in the reproductive
system of mature females that repeats every month. While the egg and
follicle are developing in the ovary, tissues are building up inside the
**uterus** , the reproductive organ where the baby would develop. The
uterus develops a thick lining covered in tiny blood vessels. This
prepares the uterus to receive an egg that could develop into a child (a
fertilized egg). The occurs during the first part of the cycle.

Ovulation, the release of an egg from the ovary, occurs at about the
midpoint of the cycle. This would be around day 14 of a 28 day cycle.
The egg is swept into the fallopian tube. If sperm is present,
fertilization may occur. As sperm can only survive in the fallopian tube
for up to a few days, fertilization can only occur within those few days
post-ovulation.

If the egg is fertilized, the egg makes its way through the fallopian
tube into the uterus, where it imbeds into the thick lining. When this
occurs, the monthly cycle stops. The monthly cycle does not resume until
the pregnancy is over.

If a sperm *does not* enter an egg, the lining of the uterus breaks
down. Blood and other tissues from the lining break off from the uterus.
They pass through the vagina and out of the body. This is called
**menstruation** . Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It
lasts about 4 days, on average. When the menstrual period ends, the
cycle repeats. Some women feel discomfort during this process.

Some people think that the average length of a menstrual period is the
same as the “normal” length. They assume that shorter or longer
menstrual periods are not normal. In fact, menstrual periods can vary
from 1 to 8 days in length. This is usually normal. The average length
of the cycle (time between menstrual periods) is about 28 days, but
there is no “normal” cycle length.

**Where do sperm meet the egg?**

You might guess that sperm meet the egg in the uterus, the organ where
the baby develops. But that is incorrect. The sperm meet the egg in the
fallopian tubes that carry the egg from the ovary to the uterus. Then
the developing embryo travels to the uterus.

### Fertilization and Implantation {#12.html#x-ck12-RmVydGlsaXphdGlvbiBhbmQgSW1wbGFudGF0aW9u_71-jut}

The sperm and egg don’t look anything like a human baby ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wNy1zcGVybS1wZW5ldHJhdGluZy1lZ2c.) ).
After they come together, they will develop into a human being. How does
a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells?
Keep reading to find out.

Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine
together. This is called **fertilization** . Sperm are released into the
vagina during sexual intercourse. They “swim” through the uterus and
enter a **fallopian tube** . This is where fertilization normally takes
place.

A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wNy1zcGVybS1wZW5ldHJhdGluZy1lZ2c.) ).
If the sperm breaks through the egg’s membrane, it will immediately
cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that
only a single sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to
go through meiosis. Recall that **meiosis** , cell division that creates
the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact,
it begins prior to birth.

**Figure 12.134**

This sperm is ready to penetrate the membrane of this egg. Notice the
difference in size of the sperm and egg. Why is the egg so much larger?
The egg contributes all the cytoplasm and organelles to the zygote. The
sperm only contributes one set of chromosomes.

</div>

The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other
cells in the body. These cells are haploid, with a single set of
chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a
cell with the full number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a
**zygote** . The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, one
from each parent. A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a
total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). The zygote slowly travels down the
fallopian tube to the uterus. As it travels, it divides by mitosis many
times. It forms a hollow ball of cells.

After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it fixes itself to the side
of the uterus. This is called **implantation** . It usually happens
about a week after fertilization. Now the implanted ball of cells is
ready to continue its development into a baby boy or girl.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._71-pdn}

-   Fertilization occurs when an egg and sperm come together to form
    a zygote.
-   Implantation occurs when the developing embryo fixes itself to the
    side of the uterus.

**Does a growing embryo always look like a tiny human?**

The above picture shows the very early stages of human development.
Notice that, at first, the embryo doesn't look very human! It takes time
for the human features to take shape.

### Pregnancy and Childbirth {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJlZ25hbmN5IGFuZCBDaGlsZGJpcnRo_72-4uf}

While a woman is pregnant, the developing baby may be called an embryo
or a fetus. Do these mean the same thing? No, in the very early stages
the developing baby is called an embryo, while in the later stages it is
called a fetus. When the ball of cells first implants into the uterus,
it is called an **embryo** . The embryo stage lasts until the end of the
8 ^th^ week after fertilization. After that point until birth, the
developing baby is called a **fetus** .

#### Growth and Development of the Embryo {#12.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBEZXZlbG9wbWVudCBvZiB0aGUgRW1icnlv_72-vhd}

During the embryo stage, the baby grows in size.

-   3 ^rd^ week after fertilization: Cells of different types start
    to develop. Cells that will form muscles and skin, for example,
    start to develop at this time.
-   4 ^th^ week after fertilization: Body organs begin to form.
-   8 ^th^ week after fertilization: All the major organs have started
    to develop.

Pictured below are some of the changes that take place during the 4 ^th^
and 8 ^th^ weeks ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wOC1FbWJyeW8tZHVyaW5nLWZpcnN0LTQtd2Vla3M.)
). Look closely at the two embryos in the figure. Do you think that the
older embryo looks more human? Notice that it has arms and legs and
lacks a tail. The face has also started to form, and it is much bigger.

**Figure 12.135**

Embryonic Development (Weeks 4–8). Most organs develop in the embryo
during weeks four through eight. (Note: the drawings of the embryos are
not to scale.)

</div>

#### Growth and Development of the Fetus {#12.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBEZXZlbG9wbWVudCBvZiB0aGUgRmV0dXM._72-cil}

There are also many changes that take place after the embryo becomes a
fetus. Some of the differences between them are obvious. For example,
the fetus has ears and eyelids. Its fingers and toes are also fully
formed. The fetus even has fingernails and toenails. In addition, the
reproductive organs have developed to make the baby a male or female.
The brain and lungs are also developing quickly. The fetus has started
to move around inside the uterus. This is usually when the mother first
feels the fetus moving.

By the 28 ^th^ week, the fetus is starting to look much more like a
baby. Eyelashes and eyebrows are present. Hair has started to grow on
the head. The body of the fetus is also starting to fill out as muscles
and bones develop. Babies born after the 28 ^th^ week are usually able
to survive. However, they need help breathing because their lungs are
not yet fully mature. A baby should not be delivered prior to this time,
unless absolutely necessary. A baby born prior to week 28 will need
considerable medical intervention to survive.

During the last several weeks of the fetal period, all of the organs
become mature. The most obvious change, however, is an increase in body
size. The fetus rapidly puts on body fat and gains weight during the
last couple of months. By the end of the 38 ^th^ week, all of the organs
are working, and the fetus is ready to be born. This is when birth
normally occurs. A baby born before this time is considered premature.

#### The Amniotic Sac and Placenta {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEFtbmlvdGljIFNhYyBhbmQgUGxhY2VudGE._72-1ac}

During pregnancy, other structures also develop inside the mother’s
uterus. They are the amniotic sac, placenta, and umbilical cord (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0wOS0zOC13ZWVrLWZldHVz) ).

**Figure 12.136**

Surrounding the fetus is the fluid-filled amniotic sac. The placenta and
umbilical cord are also shown here. They provide a connection between
the mother’s and fetus’s blood for the transfer of nutrients and gases.

</div>

-   The **amniotic sac** is a membrane that surrounds the fetus. It is
    filled with water and dissolved substances, known as amniotic fluid.
    Imagine placing a small plastic toy inside a balloon and then
    filling the balloon with water. The toy would be cushioned and
    protected by the water. It would also be able to move freely inside
    the balloon. The amniotic sac and its fluid are like a
    water-filled balloon. They cushion and protect the fetus. They also
    let the fetus move freely inside the uterus.

<!-- -->

-   The **placenta** is a spongy mass of blood vessels. Some of the
    vessels come from the mother. Some come from the fetus. The placenta
    is attached to the inside of the mother’s uterus. The fetus is
    connected to the placenta by a tube called the **umbilical cord** .
    The cord contains two arteries and a vein. Substances pass back and
    forth between the mother’s and fetus’s blood through the placenta
    and cord. Oxygen and nutrients pass from the mother to the fetus.
    Carbon dioxide passes from the fetus to the mother.

It is important for the mother to eat plenty of nutritious foods during
pregnancy. She must take in enough nutrients for the fetus as well as
for herself. She needs extra calories, proteins, and lipids. She also
needs more vitamins and minerals.

In addition to eating well, the mother must avoid substances that could
harm the embryo or fetus. These include alcohol, illegal drugs, and some
medicines. It is especially important for her to avoid these substances
during the first eight weeks after fertilization. This is when all the
major organs are forming. Exposure to harmful substances during this
time could damage the developing body systems.

#### Childbirth {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hpbGRiaXJ0aA.._72-nw5}

During **childbirth** , a baby passes from the uterus, through the
vagina, and out of the mother’s body. Childbirth usually starts when the
amniotic sac breaks.

Then, the muscles of the uterus start contracting. The contractions get
stronger and closer together. They may go on for hours. Eventually, the
contractions squeeze the baby out of the uterus. Once the baby enters
the vagina, the mother starts pushing. She soon pushes the baby through
the vagina and out of her body.

As soon as the baby is born, the umbilical cord is cut. After the cord
is cut, the baby can no longer get rid of carbon dioxide through the
cord and placenta. As a result, carbon dioxide builds up in the baby’s
blood. This triggers the baby to start breathing. The amniotic sac and
placenta pass through the vagina and out of the body shortly after the
birth of the baby.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._72-qkw}

**Does a baby learn much during his first year?**

The first years of life are full of important milestones as new skills
are mastered. For example, at first this baby wasn't even able to roll
over on his stomach or hold up his head!

### Infancy and Childhood {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5mYW5jeSBhbmQgQ2hpbGRob29k_73-tf0}

The first year after birth is called **infancy** . Infancy is a period
when the baby grows very fast. During infancy, the baby doubles in
length and triples in weight. Other important changes also happen during
infancy:

-   The baby's teeth start to come in, usually at about six months of
    age ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0xMC1zaXgtbW9udGgtdGVldGg.) ).
-   The baby starts smiling, paying attention to other people, and
    grabbing toys.
-   The baby begins making babbling sounds. By the end of the first
    year, the baby is starting to say a few words, such as “mama” and
    “dada.”
-   The baby learns to sit, crawl, and stand. By the end of the first
    year, the baby may be starting to walk.

**Figure 12.137**

This baby's teeth have started to come in. Babies often chew on toys or
other objects when they are getting new teeth. They may even chew on
their toes.

**Childhood** begins after the baby’s first birthday and continues until
the teen years. Between one and three years of age, a child is called a
**toddler** . During the toddler stage, growth is still fast, but not as
fast as it was during infancy. A toddler learns many new words. The
child even starts putting together words in simple sentences. Motor
skills also develop quickly during this stage. By age three, most
children can run and climb steps. They can hold crayons and scribble
with them. They can also feed themselves and use the toilet.

From age three until the teens, growth is slower. The body also changes
shape. The arms and legs get longer compared to the trunk. Children
continue to develop new motor skills. For example, many young children
learn how to ride a tricycle and then a bicycle. Most also learn how to
play games and sports ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0xMS1Tb2NjZXI.) ). By age six,
children start losing their baby teeth. Their permanent teeth begin
coming in to replace them. They also start school and learn how to read
and write. They develop friendships and become less dependent on their
parents.

#### Early Childhood Development {#12.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgQ2hpbGRob29kIERldmVsb3BtZW50_73-wfy}

There are numerous milestones that occur during the first few years of
childhood. These include

-   the use of language,
-   walking and running,
-   understanding simple concepts,
-   pretend play,
-   the development of fine motor skills,
-   the development of independence,
-   having temper tantrums,
-   demonstrating separation anxiety,
-   becoming fully potty-trained,
-   showing natural curiosity.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._73-jqx}

-   The first year after birth is called infancy, after which
    childhood begins.
-   An individual grows quickly and develops new abilities during
    infancy and childhood.

**How do you know you are entering puberty?**

The first signs of puberty appear at different times for different
people. A boy might realize he's reached puberty when he starts needing
to shave. A girl, on the other hand, starts getting her menstrual period
during puberty.

### Puberty and Adolescence {#12.html#x-ck12-UHViZXJ0eSBhbmQgQWRvbGVzY2VuY2U._74-0hi}

**Puberty** is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature.
Puberty lasts from about 12 to 18 years of age in boys and from about 10
to 16 years of age in girls. The age when puberty begins is different
from one child to another. Children that begin puberty much earlier or
later than their peers may feel self-conscious. They may also worry that
something is wrong with them. Usually, an early or late puberty is
perfectly normal.

In boys, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the testes to
secrete testosterone. Testosterone causes the following to happen:

1.  The penis and testes grow.
2.  The testes start making sperm.
3.  Pubic and facial hair grow.
4.  The shoulders broaden, and the voice becomes deeper.

In girls, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the ovaries to
secrete estrogen. Estrogen causes the following to happen:

1.  The uterus and ovaries grow.
2.  The ovaries start releasing eggs.
3.  The menstrual cycle begins.
4.  Pubic hair grows.
5.  The hips widen, and the breasts develop.

Boys and girls are close to the same height during childhood. In both
boys and girls, growth in height and weight is very fast during puberty.
But boys grow faster than girls during puberty. Their period of fast
growth also lasts longer. By the end of puberty, boys are an average of
10 centimeters (4 inches) taller than girls.

#### Adolescence {#12.html#x-ck12-QWRvbGVzY2VuY2U._74-v0w}

**Adolescence** is the period of life between the start of puberty and
the beginning of adulthood. Adolescence includes the physical changes of
puberty. It also includes many other changes, including significant
mental, emotional, and social changes. During adolescence:

-   Teenagers develop new thinking abilities. For example, they can
    think about abstract ideas, such as freedom. They are also better at
    thinking logically. They are usually better at solving problems
    as well.
-   Teenagers try to establish a sense of who they are as individuals.
    They may try to become more independent from their parents. Most
    teens also have emotional ups and downs. This is partly due to
    changing hormone levels.
-   Teenagers usually spend much more time with peers than with
    family members.

**What does adulthood mean to you?**

You might think sometimes that you can't wait to be an adult! In
adulthood you have greater freedom, but you also have greater
responsibilities. Like this man, you might have a house and children to
take care of.

### Adulthood {#12.html#x-ck12-QWR1bHRob29k_75-vwi}

When is a person considered an adult? That depends. Most teens become
physically mature by the age of 16 or so. But they are not adults in a
legal sense until they are older. For example, in the U.S., you must be
18 to vote. Once **adulthood** begins, it can be divided into three
stages: (1) early, (2) middle, and (3) late adulthood.

#### Early Adulthood {#12.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgQWR1bHRob29k_75-9hq}

**Early adulthood** starts at age 18 or 21. It continues until the
mid-30s. During early adulthood, people are at their physical peak. They
are also usually in good health. The ability to have children is
greatest during early adulthood, as well. This is the stage of life when
most people complete their education. They are likely to begin a career
or take a full-time job. Many people also marry and start a family
during early adulthood.

#### Middle Adulthood {#12.html#x-ck12-TWlkZGxlIEFkdWx0aG9vZA.._75-gth}

**Middle adulthood** begins in the mid-30s. It continues until the
mid-60s.

During middle adulthood, people start to show signs of aging. Their hair
slowly turns gray. Their skin develops wrinkles. The risk of health
problems also increases during middle adulthood. For example, heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes become more common during this time. This
is the stage of life when people are most likely to achieve career
goals. Their children also grow up and may leave home during this stage.

#### Late Adulthood {#12.html#x-ck12-TGF0ZSBBZHVsdGhvb2Q._75-dkw}

**Late adulthood** begins in the mid-60s. It continues until death. This
is the stage of life when most people retire from work. They are also
likely to reflect on their life. They may focus on their grandchildren.

During late adulthood, people are not as physically able. For example,
they usually have less muscle and slower reflexes. Their immune system
also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, they have a harder
time fighting diseases like the flu. The risk of developing diseases
such as heart disease and cancer continues to rise. Arthritis is also
common. In arthritis, joints wear out and become stiff and painful. As
many as one in four late adults may develop Alzheimer’s disease. In this
disease, brain changes cause mental abilities to decrease.

Despite problems such as these, many people remain healthy and active
into their 80s or even 90s. Do you want to be one of them? Then adopt a
healthy lifestyle now and follow it for life. Doing so will increase
your chances of staying healthy and active to an old age. Exercising the
body and brain help prevent the physical and mental effects of aging.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._75-dtw}

**What is safe sex?**

Safe sex is sexual activity engaged in by people who have taken
precautions to protect themselves against sexually transmitted
infections. Abstaining from sexual activity, however, is the only way to
be absolutely sure that you won't get a sexually transmitted infection.

### Sexually Transmitted Infections {#12.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsbHkgVHJhbnNtaXR0ZWQgSW5mZWN0aW9ucw.._76-dn5}

A **sexually transmitted infection (STI)** is an infection that spreads
through sexual contact. STIs are caused by **pathogens** , a living
thing or virus that causes infection. The pathogens enter the body
through the reproductive organs. Many STIs also spread through body
fluids, such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way an
STI could spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her baby
during childbirth.

STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One
reason is that young people are more likely to take risks. They also may
not know how STIs spread. They are likely to believe myths about STIs (
**Table** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U2V4dWFsbHlURA..) ).

  **Myth**                                                                **Fact**
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you are sexually active with just one person, you can’t get STIs.    The only way to avoid the risk of STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity.
  If you don’t have any symptoms, then you don’t have an STI.             Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in females.
  Getting STIs is no big deal, because STIs can be cured with medicine.   Only some STIs can be cured with medicine; other STIs cannot be cured.

Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses. STIs caused by bacteria
usually can be cured with drugs called antibiotics. But antibiotics are
not effective against viruses. Therefore, STIs caused by viruses are not
treated with antibiotics. Other drugs may be used to help control the
symptoms of viral STIs, but they cannot be cured. Once you have a viral
STI, you are usually infected for life.

#### Bacterial STIs {#12.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWFsIFNUSXM._76-yb4}

In the U.S., **chlamydia** is the most common STI caused by bacteria.
Females are more likely than males to develop the infection. Rates of
chlamydia among U.S. females in 2006 are shown below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0xNC1jaGxhbXlkaWEtZGF0YQ..) ). Rates
were much higher in teens and young women than in other age groups.

Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also
cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in
many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they
are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes
untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause
infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections
may leave a woman unable to have children.

This graph shows data on the number of cases of chlamydia in U.S. males
and females in 2009. Which two age groups had the highest rates of
chlamydia? Why do you think rates were highest in these age groups?

</div>

**Gonorrhea** is another common STI. Gonorrhea may cause pain during
urination. It may also cause a discharge from the vagina or penis. On
the other hand, some people with gonorrhea have no symptoms. As a
result, they don’t seek treatment. Without treatment, gonorrhea may lead
to infection of other reproductive organs. This can happen in males as
well as females.

**Syphilis** is a very serious STI. Luckily, it is less common than
chlamydia or gonorrhea. Syphilis usually begins with a small sore on the
genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like
symptoms. If syphilis is not treated, it may damage the heart, brain,
and other organs. It can even cause death.

#### Viral STIs {#12.html#x-ck12-VmlyYWwgU1RJcw.._76-etc}

Genital warts are an STI caused by human papilloma virus, or **HPV** .
They are one of the most common STIs in teenagers. HPV infections cannot
be cured. But a new vaccine called Gardasil® can prevent most HPV
infections in females. Many doctors recommend that females between the
ages of 9 and 26 years receive the vaccine. Preventing HPV infections in
females is important because HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix.

A related herpes virus causes cold sores on the lips ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMi0xNS1jb2xkLXNvcmU.) ). Both viruses
cause painful blisters. In the case of **genital herpes** , the blisters
are on the penis or around the vaginal opening. The blisters go away on
their own, but the virus remains in the body. The blisters may come back
repeatedly, especially when a person is under stress. There is no cure
for genital herpes. But drugs can help prevent or shorten outbreaks.
Researchers are trying to find a vaccine to prevent genital herpes.

**Figure 12.142**

This lip blister, or cold sore, is caused by a herpes virus. The virus
is closely related to the virus that causes genital herpes. The genital
herpes virus causes similar blisters on the genitals. If you’ve ever had
a cold sore, you know how painful they can be. Genital herpes blisters
are also painful.

</div>

**Hepatitis B** is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus
called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity.
Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and
eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are
sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually
damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help
prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect
against hepatitis B.

**HIV** stands for "human immunodeficiency virus." It is the virus that
causes AIDS. HIV and AIDS are described in a previous concept. HIV can
spread through sexual contact. It can also spread through body fluids
such as blood. There is no cure for HIV infection, and AIDS can cause
death, although AIDS can be delayed for several years with medication.
Researchers are trying to find a vaccine to prevent HIV infection.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._76-8is}

-   Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by pathogens. They
    spread through sexual contact or other exchanges of body fluids.
-   Examples of STIs caused by bacteria include chlamydia, gonorrhea,
    and syphilis.
-   Examples of STIs caused by viruses include HPV, genital herpes,
    hepatitis B, and AIDS.

**Why should women perform a monthly breast self-exam?**

If you are a young woman, getting in the habit of performing a monthly
breast self-exam is a good idea. Lumps or other subtle changes in the
breasts may indicate breast cancer. The outcome is typically better if
breast cancer is caught and treated early.

### Other Reproductive System Disorders {#12.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgUmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlIFN5c3RlbSBEaXNvcmRlcnM._77-n0x}

Many disorders of the reproductive system are not sexually transmitted
infections. They are not caused by pathogens, so they don’t spread from
person to person. They develop for other reasons. The disorders are
different between males and females. In both genders, the disorders
could cause a little discomfort, or they could cause death.

#### Disorders in Males {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlzb3JkZXJzIGluIE1hbGVz_77-q0x}

Most common disorders of the male reproductive system involve the
testes. For example, injuries to the testes are very common. In
teenagers, injuries to the testes most often occur while playing sports.
An injury such as a strike or kick to the testes can be very painful. It
may also cause bruising and swelling. Such injuries do not usually last
very long.

Another disorder of the testes is **cancer** . Cancer of the testes is
most common in males aged 15 to 35. It occurs when cells in the testes
grow out of control. The cells form a lump called a tumor. If found
early, cancer of the testes usually can be easily cured with surgery.

#### Disorders in Females {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlzb3JkZXJzIGluIEZlbWFsZXM._77-twt}

Disorders of the female reproductive system may affect the vagina,
uterus, or ovaries. They may also affect the breasts.

One of the most common disorders is **vaginitis** . This is redness and
itching of the vagina. It may be due to irritation by soap or bubble
bath. Another possible cause of vaginitis is a yeast infection. Yeast
normally grow in the vagina. A **yeast infection** happens when the
yeast multiply too fast and cause symptoms. A yeast infection can be
treated with medication.

girls](ck12_12_files/20150911113807156604.jpeg "Bubble baths may cause irritation to the vagina for women and girls")

**Figure 12.143**

Bubble baths may be fun, but for women and girls they can cause
irritation to the vagina.

</div>

A common disorder of the ovaries is an **ovarian cyst** . A cyst is a
sac filled with fluid or other material. An ovarian cyst is usually
harmless, but it may cause pain. Most cysts slowly disappear and do not
need treatment. Very large or painful cysts can be removed with surgery.

Many teen girls have painful menstrual periods. They typically have
cramping in the lower abdomen. Generally, this is nothing to worry
about. Taking a warm bath or using a heating pad often helps. Exercise
can help as well. A pain reliever like ibuprofen may also work. If the
pain is severe, a doctor can prescribe stronger medicine to relieve the
pain.

The most common type of cancer in females is **breast cancer** . The
cancer causes the cells of the breast to grow out of control and form a
tumor. Breast cancer is rare in teens. It becomes more common as women
get older. If breast cancer is found early, it usually can be cured with
surgery.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._77-qcw}

-   In males, disorders of the reproductive system include injuries to
    the testes and cancer of the testes.
-   In females, disorders of the reproductive system include vaginitis
    and breast cancer.

**What protective equipment do these boys need?**

Along with shin guards, a protective cup is useful in preventing
injuries. A kicked ball or kick to the groin can really hurt. Wearing a
protective cup also prevents a potentially serious injury to the testes.

### Keeping the Reproductive System Healthy {#12.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyB0aGUgUmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlIFN5c3RlbSBIZWFsdGh5_78-yes}

As was discussed in previous concepts, both infectious and noninfectious
diseases of the reproductive system can be very serious. But there are
ways to keep your reproductive system healthy. What can you do to keep
your reproductive system healthy? You can start by making the right
choices for overall good health. To be as healthy as you can be, you
should:

-   Eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in fat.
-   Drink plenty of water.
-   Get regular exercise.
-   Maintain a healthy weight.
-   Get enough sleep.
-   Avoid using tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs.
-   Manage stress in healthy ways.

Keeping your genitals clean is also very important. A daily shower or
bath is all that it takes. Females do not need to use special feminine
hygiene products. In fact, using them may do more harm than good because
they can irritate the vagina or other reproductive structures.

You should also avoid other behaviors that can put you at risk. Do not
get into contact with another person’s blood or other body fluids. For
example, never get a tattoo or piercing unless you are sure that the
needles have not been used before. This is one of the most important
ways to prevent an STI. Of course, the only way to be fully protected
against STIs is to refrain from sexual activity.

If you are a boy, you should always wear a protective cup when you play
contact sports. Contact sports include football, boxing, and hockey.
Wearing a cup will help protect the testes from injury. You should also
do a monthly self-exam to check for cancer of the testes.

If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every four to
six hours. Leaving tampons in for too long can put you at risk of
**toxic shock syndrome** . This is a serious condition. Signs and
symptoms of toxic shock syndrome develop suddenly, and the disease can
be fatal. The disease involves fever, shock, and problems with the
function of several body organs.

Girls should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check
for breast cancer. Although breast cancer is rare in teens, it's a good
idea to start doing the exam when you are young. It will help you get to
know what is normal for you.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._78-4rz}

-   To keep the reproductive system healthy, keep the genitals clean and
    avoid coming into contact with body fluids, like blood or semen.
-   To check for cancer, women should perform monthly self-exams of
    their breasts, and men should perform monthly self-exams of
    their testes.

## Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-wzj}

The human body. Made of numerous organ systems. Maybe one of the most
complex structures ever. But all these systems and structures come
together in an exquisite manner to make a fascinating organism.
Currently, the end of the line of evolution. The most intelligent of all
organisms. An organism that can protect itself from pathogens, has bones
for support, muscles to help it move, systems that allow it to respond
to the environment, systems to bring oxygen into and around the body,
systems to extract nutrients from food and get rid of wastes, and
systems to make the next generation. And all these systems and organs
and tissues and cells work together to form one complete organism.

**What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources,
biomes and their populations, and all the species and their
relationships?**

You get ecology. Understanding ecology is in part understanding the
biology of our planet. And it can easily be argued that this is
especially important today. We literally hold the future of our planet
in our hands. The lessons in this concept discuss ecology, and all the
related aspects that comprise the ecosystem.

**Do organisms live in isolation?**

No, organisms are not separated from their environment or from other
organisms. They interact in many ways with their surroundings. For
example, these deer may be drinking from this stream or eating nearby
plants. Ecology is the study of these interactions.

### Introduction to Ecology {#13.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIEVjb2xvZ3k.-5iz}

Life Science can be studied at many different levels. You can study
small things like cells. Or you can study big things like a group of
animals. You can also study the **biosphere,** which is any area in
which organisms live. The study of the biosphere is part of **ecology**
, the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with
their environment.

#### Research in Ecology {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVzZWFyY2ggaW4gRWNvbG9neQ..-n8w}

Ecology involves many different fields, including geology, soil science,
geography, meteorology, genetics, chemistry, and physics. You can also
divide ecology into the study of different organisms, such as animal
ecology, plant ecology, insect ecology, and so on.

Ecologists also study biomes. A **biome** is a large community of plants
and animals that live in the same place. For example, ecologists can
study the biomes as diverse as the Arctic, the tropics, or the desert (
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wMS1hdGFjYW1hLWRlc2VydA..)
). They may want to know why different species live in different biomes.
They may want to know what would make a particular biome or ecosystem
stable. Can you think of other aspects of a biome or ecosystem that
ecologists could study?

Ecologists do two types of research:

1.  Field studies.
2.  Laboratory studies.

Field studies involve collecting data outside in the natural world. An
ecologist who completes a field study may travel to a tropical
rainforest to study, count, and classify all of the insects that live in
a certain area. Laboratory studies involve working inside, usually in a
controlled environment. Sometimes, ecologists collect data from the
field, and then they analyze that data in the lab. Also, they use
computer programs to predict what will happen to organisms that live in
a specific area. For example, they may make predictions about what
happens to insects in the rainforest after a fire.

#### Organisms and Environments {#13.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5pc21zIGFuZCBFbnZpcm9ubWVudHM.-7gt}

All organisms have the ability to grow and reproduce. To grow and
reproduce, organisms must get materials and energy from the environment.
Plants obtain their energy from the sun through **photosynthesis** ,
whereas animals obtain their energy from other organisms. Either way,
these plants and animals, as well as the bacteria and fungi, are
constantly interacting with other species as well as the non-living
parts of their ecosystem.

An organism’s environment includes two types of factors:

1.  **Abiotic factors** are the parts of the environment that are not
    living, such as sunlight, climate, soil, water, and air.
2.  **Biotic factors** are the parts of the environment that are alive,
    or were alive and then died, such as plants, animals, and
    their remains. Biotic factors also include bacteria, fungi
    and protists.

Ecology studies the interactions between biotic factors, such as
organisms like plants and animals, and abiotic factors. For example, all
animals (biotic factors) breathe in oxygen (abiotic factor). All plants
(biotic factor) absorb carbon dioxide (abiotic factor) and need water
(abiotic factor) to survive.

Can you think of another way that abiotic and biotic factors interact
with each other?

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-hlz}

-   Ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each
    other and with their environment.
-   Abiotic factors are the parts of the environment that have never
    been alive, while biotic factors are the parts of the environment
    that are alive, or were alive and then died.

**How is your school organized?**

Your school is organized at several levels. Individual students and
teachers are divided into classes. These classes are organized into an
entire middle school. Your middle school and other nearby schools are
organized into a school district. Just like schools are organized,
ecosystems are also organized into several different levels, and an
ecosystem can be studied at any one of the various levels of
organization.

### Levels of Ecological Organization {#13.html#x-ck12-TGV2ZWxzIG9mIEVjb2xvZ2ljYWwgT3JnYW5pemF0aW9u_1-k3l}

Ecosystems can be studied at small levels or at large levels. The levels
of organization are described below from the smallest to the largest:

-   A **species** is a group of individuals that are genetically related
    and can breed to produce fertile young. Individuals are not members
    of the same species if their members cannot produce offspring that
    can also have children. The second word in the two word name given
    to every organism is the species name. For example, in *Homo
    sapiens* , sapiens is the species name.
-   A **population** is a group of organisms belonging to the same
    species that live in the same area and interact with one another.
-   A **community** is all of the populations of different species that
    live in the same area and interact with one another. A community is
    composed of all of the biotic factors of an area.
-   An **ecosystem** includes the living organisms (all the populations)
    in an area and the non-living aspects of the environment (
    **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wMy1ncmVhdC1iYXJyaWVyLXJlZWY.) ).
    An ecosystem is made of the biotic and abiotic factors in an area.

    **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wMi1nbG9iYWwtYmlvc3BoZXJl) ). The
    biosphere includes most of Earth, including part of the oceans and
    the atmosphere.

Ecologists study ecosystems at every level, from the individual organism
to the whole ecosystem and biosphere. They can ask different types of
questions at each level. Examples of these questions are given in
**Table** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6RWNvbG9naWNhbEVjb3N5c3RlbXM.)

**What is a population?**

When you think of the word *population,* you might think of the number
of people in your town or city. But humans are not the only species to
have populations. Every species has a population. Or many populations.
This group of penguins, which are all members of the same species and
all living together in the same space, is a population.

### What is a Population {#13.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIFBvcHVsYXRpb24._2-nyl}

A **population** is a group of organisms of the same species, all living
in the same area and interacting with each other. Since they live
together in one area, members of the same species reproduce together.
Ecologists who study populations determine how healthy or stable the
populations are. They also study how the individuals of a species
interact with each other and how populations interact with the
environment. If a group of similar organisms in the same area cannot
reproduce with members of the other group, then they are members of two
distinct species and form two populations.

Ecologists look at many factors that help to describe a population.
First, ecologists can measure the number of individuals that make up the
population, known as **population size** . They can then determine the
**population density** , which is the number of individuals of the same
species in an area. Population density can be expressed as *number per
area* , such as 20 mice/acre, or 50 rabbits/square mile.

Ecologists also study how individuals in a population are spread across
an environment. This spacing of individuals within a population is
called **dispersion** . Some species may be clumped or clustered (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wNC1jbHVtcGVkLWxvb3Nlc3RyaWZlLXBsYW50cw..)
) in an area. Others may be evenly spaced ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wNS1zb25vcmFuLWNhY3Rp) ). Still
others may be spaced randomly within an area. The population density and
dispersion have an effect on reproduction and population size. What do
you think the relationship is between population density, dispersion and
size?

Ecologists also study the birth and death rates of the population.
Together these give the growth rate (the birth rate minus the death
rate), which tells how fast (or slow) the population size is changing.
The **birth rate** is the number of births within a population during a
specific time period. The **death rate** is the number of deaths within
a population during a specific time period. Knowing the birth and death
rates of populations gives you information about a population’s health.
For example, when a population is made up of mostly young organisms and
the birth rate is high, the population is growing. A population with
equal birth and death rates will remain the same size. Populations that
are decreasing in size have a higher death rate than birth rate.

**What affects population growth in the United States?**

One way the population of the United States has grown is through the
movement of individuals into the United States from other parts of the
world. The same effects can be seen in wildlife populations. Individuals
move into a population and increase its size. This is just one of the
many factors affecting population growth. Of course, individuals may
also move away from a population.

### Population Growth {#13.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBHcm93dGg._3-kn7}

What does population growth mean? You can probably guess that it means
the number of individuals in a population is increasing. The
**population growth rate** tells you how quickly a population is
increasing or decreasing. What determines the population growth rate for
a particular population?

#### Births, Deaths, and Migration {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlydGhzLCBEZWF0aHMsIGFuZCBNaWdyYXRpb24._3-4qg}

Population growth rate depends on birth rates and death rates, as well
as migration. First, we will consider the effects of birth and death
rates. You can predict the growth rate by using this simple equation:
*growth rate = birth rate – death rate.*

If the birth rate is larger than the death rate, then the population
grows. If the death rate is larger than the birth rate, what will happen
to the population? The population size will decrease. If the birth and
death rates are equal, then the population size will not change.

Factors that affect population growth are:

1.  Age of organisms at first reproduction.
2.  How often an organism reproduces.
3.  The number of offspring of an organism.
4.  The presence or absence of parental care.
5.  How long an organism is able to reproduce.
6.  The death rate of offspring.

For an ecosystem to be stable, populations in that system must be
healthy, and that usually means reproducing as much as their environment
allows. Do organisms reproduce yearly or every few years? Do organisms
reproduce for much of their life, or just part of their life? Do
organisms produce many offspring at once, or just a few, or even just
one? Do many newborn organisms die, or do the majority survive? All
these factors play a role in the growth of a population.

Organisms can use different strategies to increase their reproduction
rate. **Altricial** organisms are helpless at birth, and their parents
give them a lot of care. This care is often seen in bird species. (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wNi1yZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUtc3RyYXRlZ2llcw..)
). Altricial birds are usually born blind and without feathers. Compared
to precocial organisms, altricial organisms have a longer period of
development before they reach maturity. **Precocial** organisms, such as
the geese shown below, can take care of themselves at birth and do not
require help from their parents ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wNi1yZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUtc3RyYXRlZ2llcw..)
). In order to reproduce as much as possible, altricial and precocial
organisms must use very different strategies.

</div>

#### Migration {#13.html#x-ck12-TWlncmF0aW9u_3-klb}

**Migration** is the movement of individual organisms into, or out of, a
population. Migration affects population growth rate. There are two
types of migration:

1.  **Immigration** is the movement of individuals into a population
    from other areas. This increases the population size and
    growth rate.
2.  **Emigration** is the movement of individuals out of a population.
    This decreases the population size and growth rate.

The earlier growth rate equation can be modified to account for
migration: *growth rate = (birth rate + immigration rate) – (death rate
+ emigration rate).*

One type of migration that you are probably familiar with is the
migration of birds. Maybe you have heard that birds fly south for the
winter. In the fall, birds fly thousands of miles to the south where it
is warmer. In the spring, they return to their homes. ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wOC1iYXJuYWNsZS1nZWVzZS1taWdyYXRpb24.)
).

Monarch butterflies also migrate from Mexico to the northern U.S. in the
summer and back to Mexico in the winter. These types of migrations move
entire populations from one location to another.

#### Exponential Growth {#13.html#x-ck12-RXhwb25lbnRpYWwgR3Jvd3Ro_3-cmb}

Population growth can be described with two models, based on the size of
the population and necessary resources. These two types of growth are
known as exponential growth and logistic growth. If a population is
given unlimited amounts of resources, such as food and water, land if
needed, moisture, oxygen, and other environmental factors, it will grow
exponentially. **Exponential growth** occurs as a population grows
larger, dramatically increasing the growth rate. This is shown as a
"J-shaped" curve below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wOS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWdyb3d0aC1ncmFwaHM.)
). You can see that the population grows slowly at first, but as time
passes, growth occurs more and more rapidly.

</div>

In nature, organisms do not usually have ideal environments with
unlimited food. In nature, there are limits. Sometimes, there will be
plenty of food. Sometimes, a fire will wipe out all of the available
nutrients. Sometimes a predator will kill many individuals in a
population. How do you think these limits affect the way organisms grow?

Usually, populations first grow exponentially while resources are
abundant. But as populations increase and resources become less
available, rates of growth slow down and slowly level off, reaching the
carrying capacity. The **carrying capacity** is the upper limit to the
population size that the environment can support. This type of growth is
shown as an "S-shaped" curve below ( **Figure**
[above](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0wOS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWdyb3d0aC1ncmFwaHM.)
) and is called **logistic growth.** Why do you think occurs?

    immigration, and emigration.

**What happened during the Irish Potato Famine?**

In the 1800s, a disease called potato blight destroyed much of the
potato crop in Ireland. Since many Irish people depended on potatoes as
their staple food, mass starvation and emigration resulted. This caused
Ireland's population to dramatically decrease. Lack of food is one
factor that can limit population growth.

### Limiting Factors to Population Growth {#13.html#x-ck12-TGltaXRpbmcgRmFjdG9ycyB0byBQb3B1bGF0aW9uIEdyb3d0aA.._4-4xy}

For a population to be healthy, factors such as food, nutrients, water
and space, must be available. What happens when there are not resources
to support the population? **Limiting factors** are resources or other
factors in the environment that can lower the population growth rate.
Limiting factors include a low food supply and lack of space. Limiting
factors can lower birth rates, increase death rates, or lead to
emigration.

When organisms face limiting factors, they show **logistic growth**
(S-shaped curve, curve B: **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.)
). Competition for resources like food and space cause the growth rate
to stop increasing, so the population levels off. This flat upper line
on a growth curve is the carrying capacity. The **carrying capacity**
(K) is the maximum population size that can be supported in a particular
area without destroying the habitat. Limiting factors determine the
carrying capacity of a population. Recall that when there are no
limiting factors, the population grows exponentially. In **exponential
growth** (J-shaped curve, curve A: **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.)
), as the population size increases, the growth rate also increases.

#### Food Supply as Limiting Factor {#13.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBTdXBwbHkgYXMgTGltaXRpbmcgRmFjdG9y_4-yls}

If there are 12 hamburgers at a lunch table and 24 people sit down at a
lunch table, will everyone be able to eat? At first, maybe you will
split hamburgers in half, but if more and more people keep coming to sit
at the lunch table, you will not be able to feed everyone. This is what
happens in nature. But in nature, organisms that cannot get food will
die or find a new place to live. It is possible for any resource to be a
limiting factor, however, a resource such as food can have dramatic
consequences on a population.

In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of
food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of
food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth
rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the
supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary
resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall,
the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates
drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.

When the population decreases to a certain level where every individual
can get enough food and other resources, and the birth and death rates
become stable, the population has leveled off at its carrying capacity.

#### Other Limiting Factors {#13.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgTGltaXRpbmcgRmFjdG9ycw.._4-njb}

Other limiting factors include light, water, nutrients or minerals,
oxygen, the ability of an ecosystem to recycle nutrients and/or waste,
disease and/or parasites, temperature, space, and predation. Can you
think of some other factors that limit populations?

Weather can also be a limiting factor. Whereas most plants like rain, an
individual cactus-like *Agave americana* plant actually likes to grow
when it is dry. Rainfall limits reproduction of this plant which, in
turn, limits growth rate. Can you think of some other factors like this?

Human activities can also limit the growth of populations. Such
activities include use of pesticides, such as DDT, use of herbicides,
and habitat destruction.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-9iz}

-   Limiting factors, or things in the environment that can lower the
    population growth rate, include low food supply and lack of space.
-   When organisms face limiting factors, they show logistic type of
    growth (S-curve).

**Too many people?**

In October 2011, the human population passed 7 billion people. What
problems could result if the human population continues its rapid rise?
One issue is that overpopulation makes many environmental issues more
serious. More people on the planet means more food and water is needed
and more pollution is generated. Is there a carrying capacity for the
human population?

### Human Population {#13.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gUG9wdWxhdGlvbg.._5-rj7}

How quickly is the human population growing? If we look at worldwide
human population growth from 10,000 BCE through today, our growth looks
like **exponential growth** . It increased very slowly at first, but
later grew faster and faster as the population increased in size (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xMC1odW1hbi1wb3AtZ3Jvd3RoLWhpc3Rvcnk.)
). And recently, the human population has increased at a faster pace
than ever before. It has taken only 12 years for the world's population
to increase from six billion to seven billion. Considering that in the
year 1804, there were just one billion people, and in 1927, there were
just two billion people (that's 123 years to increase from 1 to 2
billion), the recent increase in the human population growth rate is
characteristic of exponential growth. Does this mean there are unlimited
resources?

#### Five Stages {#13.html#x-ck12-Rml2ZSBTdGFnZXM._5-imb}

On the other hand, if you look at human population growth in specific
countries, you may see a different pattern. On the level of a country,
the history of human population growth can be divided into five stages,
as described in **Table**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U3RhZ2VzSHVtYW5Qb3B1bGF0aW9uR3Jvd3Ro) .
Some countries have very high birth rates, in some countries the growth
rate has stabilized, and in some countries the growth rate is in
decline.

  **Stage**   **Description**
  ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1           Birth and death rates are high and population growth is stable. This occurred in early human history.
  2           Significant drop in death rate, resulting in exponential growth. This occurred in 18th- and 19th-century Europe.
  3           Population size continues to grow.
  4           Birth rates equal death rates and populations become stable.
  5           Total population size may level off.

The United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau predict that by 2050, the
Earth will be populated by 9.4 billion people. Other estimates predict
10 to 11 billion.

#### Future Growth {#13.html#x-ck12-RnV0dXJlIEdyb3d0aA.._5-dgf}

There are two different beliefs about what type of growth the human
population will undergo in the future:

1.  **Neo-Malthusians** believe that human population growth cannot
    continue without destroying the environment, and maybe
    humans themselves.
2.  **Cornucopians** believe that the Earth can give humans a limitless
    amount of resources. They also believe that technology can solve
    problems caused by limited resources, such as lack of food.

The Cornucopians believe that a larger population is good for technology
and innovation. The 5-stage model above predicts that when all countries
are industrialized, the human population will eventually level out. But
many scientists and other Neo-Malthusians believe that humans have
already gone over the Earth’s **carrying capacity** . That means, we may
have already reached the maximum population size that can be supported,
without destroying our resources and habitat. If this is true, then
human overpopulation will lead to a lack of food and other resources.
Overpopulation may also lead to increased disease, and/or war. These
problems may cause the population of humans to crash. If these issues
are not controlled, could the human population go extinct?

Which of the above theories makes sense to you? Why?

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-x68}

-   The human population is undergoing exponential growth.
-   Future outlooks on human population growth differ; some think we
    will have a limitless amount of resources, while others think we
    have already reached our carrying capacity.

**What does it mean to compete?**

If you are in competition with someone, it usually means you are in a
contest for a prize. The prize might just be bragging rights. In nature,
the stakes are higher. Organisms must compete for resources necessary
for life.

### Competition {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGV0aXRpb24._6-0hy}

Recall that **ecology** is the study of how living organisms interact
with each other and with their environment. But how do organisms
*interact* with each other? Organisms interact with each other through
various mechanisms, one of which is competition. **Competition** occurs
when organisms strive for limited resources. Competition can be for
food, water, light, or space. This interaction can be between organisms
of the same species (intraspecific) or between organisms of different
species (interspecific).

**Intraspecific competition** happens when members of the same species
compete for the same resources. For example, two trees may grow close
together and compete for light. One may out-compete the other by growing
taller to get more available light. As members of the same species are
usually genetically different, they have different characteristics, and
in this example, one tree grows taller than the other. The organism that
is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive. The
other organism may not survive. In this example, it is the taller tree
that is better adapted to the environment.

**Interspecific competition** happens when individuals of different
species strive for a limited resource in the same area. Since any two
species have different traits, one species will be able to out-compete
the other. One species will be better adapted to its environment, and
essentially "win" the competition. The other species will have lower
reproductive success and lower population growth, resulting in a lower
survival rate. For example, cheetahs and lions feed on similar prey. If
prey is limited, then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs. This will
force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in
population.

Looking at different types of competition, ecologists developed the
**competitive exclusion principle** . The principle states that species
less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the
area, or die out. In order for two species within the same area to
coexist, they may adapt by developing different specializations. This is
known as **character displacement** . An example of character
displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of
food. They can develop different types of bills, like Darwin’s Finches (
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xMS1kYXJ3aW5zLWZpbmNoZXM.)
). Therefore, competition for resources within and between species plays
an important role in **evolution** through **natural selection** .

**Can insects hunt for food?**

When you think of an animal hunting for its food, large animals such as
lions may come to mind. But many tiny animals also hunt for their food.
For example, this praying mantis is eating a fly. To eat the fly, the
praying mantis first had to catch the fly, which is a form of hunting.

### Predation {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGF0aW9u_7-nzy}

**Predation** is another mechanism in which species interact with each
other. Predation is when a predator organism feeds on another living
organism or organisms, known as **prey** . The predator always lowers
the prey’s **fitness** . It does this by keeping the prey from
surviving, reproducing, or both. **Predator-prey relationships** are
essential to maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem.
Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra, the
bear and fish, and the fox and rabbit.

There are different types of predation, including:

-   true predation.
-   grazing.
-   parasitism.

**Figure 13.12**

This lion is an example of a predator on the hunt.

</div>

**True predation** is when a predator kills and eats its prey. Some
predators of this type, such as jaguars, kill large prey. They tear it
apart and chew it before eating it. Others, like bottlenose dolphins or
snakes, may eat their prey whole. In some cases, the prey dies in the
mouth or the digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for
example, eat millions of plankton at once. The prey is digested
afterward. True predators may hunt actively for prey, or they may sit
and wait for prey to get within striking distance. Certain traits enable
organisms to be effective hunters. These include camouflage, speed, and
heightened senses. These traits also enable certain prey to avoid
predators.

In **grazing** , the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually
kill it. You may have seen cows grazing on grass. The grass they eat
grows back, so there is no real effect on the population. In the ocean,
kelp (a type of seaweed) can regrow after being eaten by fish.

Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they
did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others.
Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators
can be **keystone species** . These are species that can have a large
effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all
of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer
or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may
decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased
levels of **producers** may then have a detrimental effect on the whole
ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.

Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators. Prey sometimes avoid
detection by using camouflage ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xMy1tYW50aXMtY2Ftb3VmbGFnZQ..) ).
**Camouflage** means that species have an appearance (color, shape, or
pattern) that helps them blend into the background. **Mimicry** is a
related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic
another species. For example, a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to
look like a poisonous dart frog. Why do you think this is an adaptation
for the non-poisonous dart frog? Mimicry can be used by both predators
and prey ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xNC1idXR0ZXJmbHktbWltaWNyeQ..) ).

**Parasitism** is a type of **symbiotic** relationship and will be
described in the *Symbiosis* concept.

**Is this little fish about to become lunch?**

Actually, this big fish is not opening his mouth to munch on these
little fish. He is opening his mouth to get his teeth cleaned! These
small fish eat dead skin and parasites from his body. Both types of fish
benefit from this relationship.

### Symbiosis {#13.html#x-ck12-U3ltYmlvc2lz_8-s92}

**Symbiosis** describes a close and long-term relationship between
different species. At least one species will benefit in a symbiotic
relationship. These relationships are often necessary for the survival
of one or both organisms. There are three types of symbiotic
relationships: mutualism, communalism, and parasitism.

-   **Mutualism** is a symbiotic relationship in which both
    species benefit.
-   **Commensalism** is a symbiotic relationship in which one species
    benefits while the other is not affected.
-   **Parasitism** is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic
    species benefits while the host species is harmed.

An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores
(plant-eaters) and the bacteria that live in their intestines. The
bacteria get a place to live. Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore
digest food. Both species benefit, so this is a mutualistic
relationship. The clownfish and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic
relationship. The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating
fish, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish
from predators ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xNS1jbG93bmZpc2gtYW5lbW9uZQ..) ).
Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the
relationship between the plover bird and the African crocodile. The tiny
blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile, and helps by
removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodile's
teeth. These food remains are the source of food for the bird. Another
example is between the ostrich and the zebra. The ostrich always moves
with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell,
whereas the zebra has very sharp senses. The ostrich has a keen sense of
sight, which the zebra lacks. Hence, these two species depend on each
other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers.

Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for
transportation or housing. For example, spiders build their webs on
trees. The spider gets to live in the tree, but the tree is unaffected.
Other commensal relationships exist between cattle egrets and livestock.
Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen
near cattle, horses and other livestock. These birds feed on the insects
that come out of the field due to the movement of the animals. They even
eat ticks, fleas, and other insects off the back of animals. The
relationship between tigers and golden jackals is also commensalism. The
jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey
left by the tiger. This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger
does not provide anything to the jackal.

**Parasites** may live either inside or on the surface of their host. An
example of a parasite is a hookworm. Hookworms are roundworms that
affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism. They live
inside of humans and cause them pain. However, the hookworms must live
inside of a host in order to survive. Parasites may even kill the host
they live on, but then they also kill their host organism, so this is
rare. Parasites are found in animals, plants, and fungi. Hookworms are
common in the moist tropic and subtropic regions. There is very little
risk of getting a parasite in industrialized nations.

**What nonliving things are essential for life?**

Living organisms cannot exist without the nonliving aspects of the
environment. For example: air, water, and sunlight, which are all
nonliving, are all essential to living organisms. Both nonliving and
living things make up an ecosystem.

### What is an Ecosystem? {#13.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhbiBFY29zeXN0ZW0__9-it8}

**Ecology** is the study of ecosystems. That is, ecology is the study of
how living organisms interact with each other and with the nonliving
part of their environment. An **ecosystem** consists of all the
nonliving factors and living organisms interacting in the same
**habitat** . Recall that living organisms are **biotic factors** . The
biotic factors of an ecosystem include all the **populations** in a
habitat, such as all the species of plants, animals, and fungi, as well
as all the micro-organisms. Also recall that the nonliving factors are
called **abiotic factors** . Abiotic factors include temperature, water,
soil, and air.

You can find an ecosystem in a large body of fresh water or in a small
aquarium. You can find an ecosystem in a large thriving forest or in a
small piece of dead wood. Examples of ecosystems are as diverse as the
rainforest, the savanna, the tundra, or the desert ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xNi1CYWphLWRlc2VydA..) ). The
differences in the abiotic factors, such as differences in temperature,
rainfall, and soil quality, found in these areas greatly contribute to
the differences seen in these ecosystems. Ecosystems can include well
known sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia
and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park,
which actually includes a few different ecosystems, some with geothermal
features, such as Old Faithful geyser.

Ecosystems need energy. Many ecosystems get their energy in the form of
sunlight, which enters the ecosystem through **photosynthesis** . This
energy then flows through the ecosystem, passed from **producers** to
**consumers** . Plants are producers in many ecosystems. Energy flows
from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to
carnivores that eat the herbivores. The flow of energy depicts
interactions of organisms within an ecosystem.

Matter is also recycled in ecosystems. **Biogeochemical cycles** recycle
nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen, so they are always available. These
nutrients are used over and over again by organisms. Water is also
continuously recycled. The flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients
and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and the
interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-dlk}

-   An ecosystem consists of all the living things and nonliving things
    interacting in the same area.
-   Matter is also recycled in ecosystems; recycling of nutrients is
    important so they can always be available

**What is your niche at school?**

Are you on the basketball team? Are you a cheerleader? Do you play an
instrument in the band? Your niche would be your role or place in the
school. Organisms also each have their own niche in the ecosystem. Is an
organism a producer or a consumer? How does the organism interact with
other organisms? Is the organism involved in any symbiotic
relationships?

### Habitat and Niche {#13.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdCBhbmQgTmljaGU._10-b7a}

#### Niche {#13.html#x-ck12-TmljaGU._10-1ne}

Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem. A **niche** is
the role a species plays in the ecosystem. In other words, a niche is
how an organism “makes a living.” A niche will include the organism's
role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem. This involves how the
organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what an organism
eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem,
which has to do with what eats the organism. An organism's niche also
includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, and its role
in recycling nutrients.

Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For
example when the Tarpan, a small wild horse found mainly in southern
Russia, became extinct in the early 1900s, its niche was filled by a
small horse breed, the Konik ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xNy1rb25pay1ob3JzZQ..) ). Often this
occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche.

</div>

A species' niche must be specific to that species; no two species can
fill the same niche. They can have very similar niches, which can
overlap, but there must be distinct differences between any two niches.
If two species do fill the same niche, they will compete for all
necessary resources. One species will out compete the other, forcing the
other species to adapt or risk extinction. This is known as competitive
exclusion.

When plants and animals are introduced, either intentionally or by
accident, into a new environment, they can occupy the existing niches of
native organisms. Sometimes new species out-compete native species, and
the native species may go extinct. They can then become a serious pest.
For example, kudzu, a Japanese vine, was planted in the southeastern
United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss. Kudzu had no
natural predators, so it was able to out-compete native species of vine
and take over their niches ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0xOC1rdWR6dQ..) ).

#### Habitat {#13.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdA.._10-uah}

The **habitat** is the physical area where a species lives. Many factors
are used to describe a habitat. The average amount of sunlight received
each day, the range of annual temperatures, and average yearly rainfall
can all describe a habitat. These and other **abiotic factors** will
affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive
there. The temperature, the amount of rainfall, the type of soil and
other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the
plants that invade an area. The plants then determine the animals that
come to eat the plants, and so on. A habitat should not be confused with
an ecosystem: the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas
the ecosystem includes both the **biotic** and abiotic factors in the
habitat.

Habitat destruction means what it sounds like—an organism's habitat is
destroyed. Habitat destruction can cause a population to decrease. If
bad enough, it can also cause species to go extinct. Clearing large
areas of land for housing developments or businesses can cause habitat
destruction. Poor fire management, pest and weed invasion, and storm
damage can also destroy habitats. National parks, nature reserves, and
other protected areas all preserve habitats.

**Where was this picture taken?**

This scene is from Anza-Borrago California Desert Park. However, deserts
exist around the globe. You might find a similar picture of a desert in
Africa. The desert is one type of biome.

### What are Biomes? {#13.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgQmlvbWVzPw.._11-lix}

Tropical rainforests and deserts are two familiar types of biomes. A
**biome** is an area with similar populations of organisms. This can
easily be seen with a community of plants and animals. Remember that a
**community** is all of the populations of different species that live
in the same area and interact with one another. Different biomes, such
as a forest ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfdHJvcGljYWxyYWluZm9yZXN0) ) or a desert,
obviously have different communities of plants and animals. How are the
plants and animals different in the rainforest than those in the desert?
Why do you think they are so different?

The differences in the biomes are due to differences in the **abiotic
factors** , especially climate. **Climate** is the typical weather in an
area over a long period of time. The climate includes the amount of
rainfall and the average temperature in the region. Obviously, the
climate in the desert is much different than the climate in the
rainforest. As a result, different types of plants and animals live in
each biome.

</div>

There are into two major groups of biomes:

1.  **Terrestrial biomes** , which are land-based, such as deserts
    and forests.
2.  **Aquatic biomes** , which are water-based, such as ponds and lakes.

The abiotic factors, such as the amount of rainfall and the temperature,
are going to influence other abiotic factors, such as the quality of the
soil. This, in turn, is going to influence the plants that migrate into
the ecosystem and thrive in that biome. Recall that **migration** is the
movement of an organism into or out of a population. It can also refer
to a whole new species moving into a **habitat** . The type of plants
that live in a biome are going to attract a certain type of animal to
that habitat. It is the interaction of the abiotic and biotic factors
that describe a biome and ecosystem. In aquatic biomes, abiotic factors
such as salt, sunlight and temperature play significant roles.

For example, a hot dry biome is going to be completely different from a
moderate wet biome. The soil quality will be different. Together, these
will result in different plants being able to occupy each biome.
Different plants will attract different animals (herbivores) to eat
these plants. These animals, in turn, will attract different
(carnivores) animals to eat the herbivores. So it is the abiotic factors
that determine the biotic factors of an ecosystem, and together these
define the biome.

**Where could this picture have been taken?**

This is an example of chaparral. This biome is usually characterized by
dwarf trees and tangled shrubs. Although this is a picture along a
Colorado road, you can also find this biome in southern California, the
Mediterranean region in Europe, and many other places.

### Terrestrial Biomes {#13.html#x-ck12-VGVycmVzdHJpYWwgQmlvbWVz_12-6rt}

A **terrestrial biome** is an area of land with a similar climate that
includes similar communities of plants and animals. Different
terrestrial biomes are usually defined in terms of their plants, such as
trees, shrubs, and grasses.

Factors such as latitude, humidity, and elevation affect biome type:

-   **Latitude** means how far a biome is from the equator. Moving from
    the poles to the equator, you will find (in order) Arctic, boreal,
    temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes.
-   **Humidity** is the amount of water in the air. Air with a high
    concentration of water will be called humid. Moving away from the
    most humid climate, biomes will be called semi-humid, semi-arid, or
    arid (the driest).
-   **Elevation** measures how high land is above sea level. It gets
    colder as you go higher above sea level, which is why you see
    snow-capped mountains.

Terrestrial biomes include grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundra.
**Grasslands** are characterized as lands dominated by grasses rather
than large shrubs or trees and include the savanna and temperate
grasslands. Forests are dominated by trees and other woody vegetation
and are classified based on their latitude. **Forests** include
tropical, temperate, and boreal forests (taiga). **Deserts** cover about
one fifth of the Earth’s surface and occur where rainfall is less than
50 cm (about 20 inches) each year. **Tundra** is the coldest of all the
biomes. The tundra is characterized for its frost-molded landscapes,
extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and
short growing seasons. There are two main types of tundra, Arctic and
Alpine tundras. Terrestrial biomes ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0yMi10YWlnYQ..) ) lying within the
Arctic and Antarctic Circles do not have very much plant or animal life.
Biomes with the highest amount of **biodiversity** , that is the most
variation in plant and animal life, are near the equator ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0yMy10cm9waWNhbC1yYWluZm9yZXN0) ).

**Is there life deep in the ocean?**

Yes, there is life even at great depths in the ocean. One example of
deep ocean life is this deep-sea chimaera. Chimaeras are related to
sharks and resemble them somewhat. But most chimaeras are adapted for
life thousands of feet under the ocean surface. This is one example of
an organism that lives in an aquatic biome.

### Aquatic Biomes {#13.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBCaW9tZXM._13-k9i}

Recall that terrestrial biomes are defined by their climate. That's
because plants and animals are adapted for certain amounts of
temperature and moisture. However, would **aquatic biomes** be
classified in the same way? No, that wouldn't make much sense—all parts
of an aquatic environment have plenty of water. Aquatic biomes can be
generally classified based on the amount of salt in the water.
**Freshwater biomes** have less than 1% salt and are typical of ponds
and lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands. **Marine biomes** have more
salt and are characteristic of the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries.

Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature
or moisture. Instead, their main limiting factors are the availability
of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in
the water.

#### Marine Biomes {#13.html#x-ck12-TWFyaW5lIEJpb21lcw.._13-xic}

Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes. Organisms that
live in marine biomes must be adapted to the salt in the water. For
example, many have organs for excreting excess salt. Marine biomes
include the oceans, coral reefs, and estuaries ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0yNC1LZWxwLWZvcmVzdA..) ). The oceans
are the largest of all the ecosystems. They can be divided into four
separate zones based on the amount of sunlight. Ocean zones are also
divided based on their depth and their distance from land. Each zone has
a great diversity of species. Within a **coral reef** , the dominant
organisms are corals. **Corals** consist partially of algae, which
provide nutrients via photosynthesis. Corals also extend tentacles to
obtain plankton from the water. Coral reefs include several species of
microorganisms, invertebrates, fishes, sea urchins, octopuses, and sea
stars. **Estuaries** are areas where freshwater streams or rivers merge
with the ocean.

#### Freshwater Biomes {#13.html#x-ck12-RnJlc2h3YXRlciBCaW9tZXM._13-hzi}

Freshwater biomes are defined by their low salt concentration, usually
less than 1%. Plants and animals in freshwater regions are adjusted to
the low salt content and would not be able to survive in areas of high
salt concentration, such as the ocean. There are different types of
freshwater biomes: ponds and lakes ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0yNi10YWhvZQ..) ), streams and rivers,
and wetlands. Ponds and lakes range in size from just a few square
meters to thousands of square kilometers. Streams and rivers are bodies
of flowing water moving in one direction. They can be found everywhere.
They get their starts at **headwaters** , which may be springs, melting
snow, or even lakes, and then travel all the way to their **mouths** ,
emptying into another water channel or the ocean. **Wetlands** are areas
of standing water that support aquatic plants. Wetlands include marshes,
swamps, and bogs.

#### Aquatic Biomes and Sunlight {#13.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBCaW9tZXMgYW5kIFN1bmxpZ2h0_13-r4p}

In large bodies of water, such as the ocean and lakes, the water can be
divided into zones based on the amount of sunlight it receives:

1.  The **photic zone** extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters
    (656 feet) below the surface of the water. This is where enough
    sunlight penetrates for **photosynthesis** to occur. Algae and other
    photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs.
2.  The **aphotic zone** is water deeper than 200 meters. This is where
    too little sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. As a
    result, producers must make "food" by **chemosynthesis** , or the
    food must drift down from the water above.

#### Aquatic Biomes and Dissolved Substances {#13.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBCaW9tZXMgYW5kIERpc3NvbHZlZCBTdWJzdGFuY2Vz_13-jsv}

Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved
oxygen and nutrients it contains:

1.  Water near the surface of lakes and the ocean usually has more
    dissolved oxygen than does deeper water. This is because surface
    water absorbs oxygen from the air above it.
2.  Water near shore generally has more dissolved nutrients than water
    farther from shore. This is because most nutrients enter the water
    from land. They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that
    empty into a body of water.
3.  Water near the bottom of lakes and the ocean may contain more
    nutrients than water closer to the surface. When aquatic organisms
    die, they sink to the bottom. Decomposers near the bottom of the
    water break down the dead organisms and release their nutrients back
    into the water.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-mwc}

-   Aquatic biomes are distinguished by the availability of sunlight and
    the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water.
-   The photic zone extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters, while the
    aphotic zone is deeper than 200 meters.
-   Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes.

**Is Earth a living organism?**

Most scientists agree that the Earth itself is not a living thing.
However, the Earth does have some aspects of life. Some scientists argue
that the Earth maintains homeostasis, a stable state, just like a living
organisms.

### The Biosphere {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJpb3NwaGVyZQ.._14-nop}

The highest level of ecological organization is the **biosphere** . It
is the part of Earth, including the air, land, surface rocks, and water,
where life is found. Parts of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and
atmosphere make up the biosphere. The **lithosphere** is the outermost
layer of the Earth's crust; essentially land is part of the lithosphere.
The **hydrosphere** is composed of all the areas that contain water,
which can be found on, under, and over the surface of Earth. The
**atmosphere** is the layer of gas that surrounds the planet. The
biosphere includes the area from about 11,000 meters below sea level to
15,000 meters above sea level. It overlaps with the lithosphere,
hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Land plants and animals are found on the
lithosphere, freshwater and marine plants and animals are found in the
hydrosphere, and birds and other flying animals are found in the
atmosphere. Of course, there are countless bacteria, protists, and fungi
that are also found in the biosphere.

#### Is the Biosphere Living? {#13.html#x-ck12-SXMgdGhlIEJpb3NwaGVyZSBMaXZpbmc__14-sch}

The **Gaia hypothesis** states that the biosphere is its own living
organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and
tends to achieve a stable state, known as **homeostasis** . For example
the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the
ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the
atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they
remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount
of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

For a better understanding of how the biosphere works and various
dysfunctions related to human activity, scientists have simulated the
biosphere in small-scale models. Biosphere 2 ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yMy0yNy1iaW9zcGhlcmUtMg..) ) is a
laboratory in Arizona that contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystems.
Ecosystems of Biosphere 2 are an ocean ecosystem with a coral reef,
mangrove wetlands, a tropical rainforest, a savannah grassland and a fog
desert. See [http://www.b2science.org/]() for additional information.

Additional biosphere projects include BIOS-3, a closed ecosystem in
Siberia, and Biosphere J, located in Japan.

**Where does all the bear's energy come from?**

Bears get their energy from their food. Brown bears eat a varied diet,
from nuts and berries to fish and other animals. When bears eat a berry,
they are obtaining energy that the plant originally captured from the
sun. Even when a bear eats another animal, the energy in that animal
ultimately came from eating a producer that captured the sun's energy.

### Producers {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJvZHVjZXJz_15-efk}

**Energy** is the ability to do work. In organisms, this work can be
physical work, like walking or jumping, or it can be the work used to
carry out the chemical processes in their cells. Every biochemical
reaction that occurs in an organism's cells needs energy. All organisms
need a constant supply of energy to stay alive.

Some organisms can get the energy directly from the sun. Other organisms
get their energy from other organisms. Through **predator-prey
relationships** , the energy of one organism is passed on to another.
Energy is constantly flowing through a community. With just a few
exceptions, all life on Earth depends on the sun’s energy for survival.

The energy of the sun is first captured by **producers** ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wMS1wcm9kdWNlcnM.) ), organisms that
can make their own food. Many producers make their own food through the
process of **photosynthesis** . The "food" the producers make is the
sugar, **glucose** . Producers make food for the rest of the ecosystem.
As energy is not recycled, energy must consistently be captured by
producers. This energy is then passed on to the organisms that eat the
producers, and then to the organisms that eat those organisms, and so
on.

Recall that the only required ingredients needed for photosynthesis are
sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ), and water (H ~2~ O). From these
simple inorganic ingredients, photosynthetic organisms produce the
carbohydrate glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ), and other complex organic
compounds. Essentially, these producers are changing the energy from the
sunlight into a usable form of energy. They are also making the oxygen
that we breathe. Oxygen is a waste product of photosynthesis.

The survival of every ecosystem is dependent on the producers. Without
producers capturing the energy from the sun and turning it into glucose,
an ecosystem could not exist. On land, plants are the dominant
producers. **Phytoplankton** , tiny photosynthetic organisms, are the
most common producers in the oceans and lakes. Algae, which is the green
layer you might see floating on a pond, are an example of phytoplankton.

There are also bacteria that use chemical processes to produce food.
They get their energy from sources other than the sun, but they are
still called producers. This process is known as **chemosynthesis** ,
and is common in ecosystems without sunlight, such as certain marine
ecosystems.

**What is breaking down this leaf?**

Notice how this leaf is slowly being broken down. This process can be
carried out by fungi and bacteria on the ground. Breaking down old
leaves is an important process since it releases the nutrients in the
dead leaves back into the soil for living plants to use.

### Consumers and Decomposers {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc3VtZXJzIGFuZCBEZWNvbXBvc2Vycw.._16-5mg}

Recall that **producers** make their own food through photosynthesis.
But many organisms are not producers and cannot make their own food. So
how do these organisms obtain their energy? They must get their energy
from other organisms. They must eat other organisms, or obtain their
energy from these organisms some other way. The organisms that obtain
their energy from other organisms are called **consumers** . All animals
are consumers, and they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and
bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other organisms,
fungi, protists, and bacteria "consume" organisms through different
methods.

The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what
they consume.

-   **Herbivores** are animals that eat producers to get energy. For
    example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants. The
    caterpillar pictured below ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wMi1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcg..) ) is
    a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments
    are also herbivores.
-   **Carnivores** feed on animals, either herbivores or
    other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks that
    eat snakes are also carnivores ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wMi1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcg..) ).
-   **Omnivores** eat both producers and consumers. Most people are
    omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from
    plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears,
    and raccoons are also omnivores.

#### Decomposers and Stability {#13.html#x-ck12-RGVjb21wb3NlcnMgYW5kIFN0YWJpbGl0eQ.._16-hpn}

**Decomposers** ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wMy1kZWNvbXBvc2Vycw..) ) get
nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes.
Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and
nitrogen, back into the environment. These nutrients are recycled back
into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them. They are passed
to other organisms when they are eaten or consumed. Many of these
nutrients are recycled back into the soil, so they can be taken up by
the roots of plants.

The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers.
Examples of decomposers include mushrooms on a decaying log. Bacteria in
the soil are also decomposers. Imagine what would happen if there were
no decomposers. Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up
and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be
released back into the ecosystem. Producers would not have enough
nutrients. The carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds,
and then cells, allowing an organism to grow, would be insufficient.
Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would
also not be sufficient. Essentially, many organisms could not exist.

**How do the grasshopper and the grass interact?**

Grasshoppers don't just hop on the grass. They also eat the grass. Other
organisms also eat the grass, and some animals even eat the grasshopper.
These interactions can be visualized by drawing a food web.

### Food Webs {#13.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBXZWJz_17-wxm}

Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to
remain stable. What exactly does this mean? Essentially, it means that
organisms must eat other organisms. **Food chains** ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wNC1mb29kLWNoYWlu) ) show the eating
patterns in an ecosystem. Food energy flows from one organism to
another. Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the
animals. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism
that eats it. For example, an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows
that the grasshopper eats the leaves. Energy and nutrients are moving
from the plant to the grasshopper. Next, a bird might prey on the
grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an owl might eat the
snake. The food chain would be:

<dl id="x-ck12-OTIyODk3MzM5ZGY4YjA3YWVkMDYwZDNiOTY3NDgyYjQ.-phn">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-OTIyODk3MzM5ZGY4YjA3YWVkMDYwZDNiOTY3NDgyYjQ.-5sh">
<dd class>
plant → grasshopper → bird → snake → owl.

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
A food chain cannot continue to go on and on. For example the food chain
could not be:

<dl id="x-ck12-Mjg1YTIxMTE2MTYwM2M4ZjFlNTk0MDg2MmY3YTg5NjM.-0cb">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-Mjg1YTIxMTE2MTYwM2M4ZjFlNTk0MDg2MmY3YTg5NjM.-ztl">
<dd>
plant → grasshopper → spider → frog → lizard → fox → hawk.

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels. Therefore, a chain has only 3
or 4 levels for energy transfer.

**Figure 13.30**

This food chain includes producers and consumers. How could you add
decomposers to the food chain?

</div>

In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this:
phytoplankton → krill → fish → shark. The **producers** are always at
the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem.
Through photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form
of glucose, but also create the food for the other organisms in the
ecosystem. The **herbivores** come next, then the **carnivores** . When
these **consumers** eat other organisms, they use the glucose in those
organisms for energy. In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill,
which are tiny, shrimp-like animals. The krill are eaten by fish, which
are then eaten by sharks. Could **decomposers** be added to a food
chain?

Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms,
so simple food chains are rare in nature. There are also many different
species of fish and sharks. So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it
must end with a distinct species of shark. A food chain does not contain
the general category of "fish," it will contain specific species of
fish. In ecosystems, there are many food chains.

Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food
chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an
ecosystem. A **food web** ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wNS1hcmN0aWMtb2NlYW4tZm9vZC13ZWI.) )
shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem.
If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer
that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks. A food web shows many
more arrows, but still shows the flow of energy. A complete food web may
show hundreds of different feeding relationships.

**How much energy could be gained from the warthog?**

If the cheetah is successful in capturing the warthog, it would gain
some energy by eating it. But would the cheetah gain as much energy as
the warthog has ever consumed? No, the warthog has used up some of the
energy it has consumed for its own needs. The cheetah will only gain a
fraction of the energy that the warthog has consumed throughout its
lifetime.

### Energy Pyramids {#13.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IFB5cmFtaWRz_18-ttr}

When an herbivore eats a plant, the **energy** in the plant tissues is
used by the herbivore. But how much of that energy is transferred to the
herbivore? Remember that plants are **producers** , bringing the energy
into the ecosystem by converting sunlight into glucose. Does the plant
use some of the energy for its own needs? Recall the energy is the
ability to do work, and the plant has plenty or "work" to do. So of
course it needs and uses energy. It converts the glucose it makes into
**ATP** through **cellular respiration** just like other organisms.
After the plant uses the energy from glucose for its own needs, the
excess energy is available to the organism that eats the plant.

The herbivore uses the energy from the plant to power its own life
processes and to build more body tissues. However, only about 10% of the
total energy from the plant gets stored in the herbivore’s body as extra
body tissue. The rest of the energy is used by the herbivore and
released as heat. The next consumer on the food chain that eats the
herbivore will only store about 10% of the total energy from the
herbivore in its own body. This means the carnivore will store only
about 1% of the total energy that was originally in the plant. In other
words, only about 10% of energy of one step in a food chain is stored in
the next step in the food chain. The majority of the energy is used by
the organism or released to the environment.

Every time energy is transferred from one organism to another, there is
a loss of energy. This loss of energy can be shown in an **energy
pyramid** . An example of an energy pyramid is pictured below (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wNi1lY29sb2dpY2FsLXB5cmFtaWQ.) ).
Since there is energy loss at each step in a food chain, it takes many
producers to support just a few carnivores in a community.

Each step of the food chain in the energy pyramid is called a **trophic
level** . Plants or other photosynthetic organisms ( **autotrophs** )
are found on the first trophic level, at the bottom of the pyramid. The
next level will be the herbivores, and then the carnivores that eat the
herbivores. The energy pyramid ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wNi1lY29sb2dpY2FsLXB5cmFtaWQ.) )
shows four levels of a food chain, from producers to carnivores. Because
of the high rate of energy loss in food chains, there are usually only 4
or 5 trophic levels in the food chain or energy pyramid. There just is
not enough energy to support any additional trophic levels.
**Heterotrophs** are found in all levels of an energy pyramid other than
the first level.

**Could you be drinking the same water as George Washington?**

Water is recycled constantly through the ecosystem. That means any water
you drank today has been around for millions of years. You could be
drinking water that was once drunk by George Washington, the first
humans, or even the dinosaurs.

### The Water Cycle {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFdhdGVyIEN5Y2xl_19-jtg}

Whereas energy flows through an ecosystem, water and elements like
carbon and nitrogen are recycled. Water and nutrients are constantly
being recycled through the environment. This process through which water
or a chemical element is continuously recycled in an ecosystem is called
a **biogeochemical cycle** . This recycling process involves both the
living organisms (biotic components) and nonliving things (abiotic
factors) in the ecosystem. Through biogeochemical cycles, water and
other chemical elements are constantly being passed through living
organisms to non-living matter and back again, over and over. Three
important biogeochemical cycles are the **water cycle** , **carbon
cycle** , and **nitrogen cycle** .

The biogeochemical cycle that recycles water is the water cycle. The
water cycle involves a series of interconnected pathways involving both
the biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. Water is obviously
an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cannot exist
without water. Many organisms contain a large amount of water in their
bodies, and many live in water, so the water cycle is essential to life
on Earth. Water continuously moves between living organisms, such as
plants, and non-living things, such as clouds, rivers, and oceans (
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wNy1XYXRlci1jeWNsZQ..) ).

The water cycle does not have a real starting or ending point. It is an
endless recycling process that involves the oceans, lakes and other
bodies of water, as well as the land surfaces and the atmosphere. The
steps in the water cycle are as follows, starting with the water in the
oceans:

1.  Water evaporates from the surface of the oceans, leaving
    behind salts. As the water vapor rises, it collects and is stored
    in clouds.
2.  As water cools in the clouds, condensation occurs. **Condensation**
    is when gases turn back into liquids.
3.  Condensation creates precipitation. **Precipitation** includes rain,
    snow, hail, and sleet. The precipitation allows the water to return
    again to the Earth’s surface.
4.  When precipitation lands on land, the water can sink into the ground
    to become part of our underground water reserves, also known as
    **groundwater** . Much of this underground water is stored in
    **aquifers** , which are porous layers of rock that can hold water.

#### Run-off {#13.html#x-ck12-UnVuLW9mZg.._19-ggh}

Most precipitation that occurs over land, however, is not absorbed by
the soil and is called **runoff** . This runoff collects in streams and
rivers and eventually flows back into the ocean.

#### Transpiration {#13.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNwaXJhdGlvbg.._19-agw}

Water also moves through the living organisms in an ecosystem. Plants
soak up large amounts of water through their roots. The water then moves
up the plant and evaporates from the leaves in a process called
**transpiration** . The process of transpiration, like evaporation,
returns water back into the atmosphere.

**Why is Earth getting warmer?**

What happens if carbon is not removed from the atmosphere? The excess
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in
Earth’s temperature, known as global warming. Where does this carbon
dioxide come from? Burning gas to power our cars and burning coal to
generate electricity are two main sources of the excess carbon dioxide.

### The Carbon Cycle {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENhcmJvbiBDeWNsZQ.._20-lqi}

Carbon is one of the most common elements found in living organisms.
Chains of carbon molecules form the backbones of many organic molecules,
such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Carbon is constantly
cycling between living organisms and the atmosphere ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wOC1jYXJib24tY3ljbGU.) ). The cycling
of carbon occurs through the **carbon cycle** .

Living organisms cannot make their own carbon, so how is carbon
incorporated into living organisms? In the atmosphere, carbon is in the
form of carbon dioxide gas (CO ~2~ ). Recall that plants and other
producers capture the carbon dioxide and convert it to glucose (C ~6~ H
~12~ O ~6~ ) through the process of **photosynthesis** . Then as animals
eat plants or other animals, they gain the carbon from those organisms.

The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O → C ~6~ H
~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ .

How does this carbon in living things end up back in the atmosphere?
Remember that we breathe out carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is
generated through the process of **cellular respiration** , which has
the reverse chemical reaction as photosynthesis. That means when our
cells burn food (glucose) for energy, carbon dioxide is released. We,
like all animals, exhale this carbon dioxide and return it back to the
atmosphere. Also, carbon is released to the atmosphere as an organism
dies and decomposes.

Cellular respiration and photosynthesis can be described as a cycle, as
one uses carbon dioxide (and water) and makes oxygen (and glucose), and
the other uses oxygen (and glucose) and makes carbon dioxide (and
water).

**Figure 13.34**

The carbon cycle. The cycling of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and
cellular respiration are main components of the carbon cycle. Carbon is
also returned to the atmosphere by the burning of organic matter
(combustion) and fossil fuels and decomposition of organic matter.

</div>

#### Formation of Fossil Fuels {#13.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIEZvc3NpbCBGdWVscw.._20-qkb}

Millions of years ago, there were so many dead plants and animals that
they could not completely decompose before they were buried. They were
covered over by soil or sand, tar or ice. These dead plants and animals
are organic matter made out of cells full of carbon-containing organic
compounds (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids). What
happened to all this carbon? When organic matter is under pressure for
millions of years, it forms **fossil fuels.** Fossil fuels are coal,
oil, and natural gas.

When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon
cycle ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0wOS1QdW1waW5nLWdhcw..) ). This carbon
is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels
releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by
photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere
than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a **greenhouse
gas** , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much
like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the
atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature,
known as **global warming** or global climate change.

**What can bean plants do that most other plants can't?**

No, they don't grow giant stalks to the clouds. Bean plants and other
legumes (plants that have their seeds in pods) can use the nitrogen in
the air to grow. It takes the help of special bacteria friends in the
soil, and this relationship is unique to the legumes.

### The Nitrogen Cycle {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE5pdHJvZ2VuIEN5Y2xl_21-0pd}

Like water and carbon, nitrogen is also repeatedly recycled through the
biosphere. This process is called the **nitrogen cycle** . Nitrogen is
one of the most common elements in living organisms. It is important for
creating both proteins and nucleic acids, like DNA. The air that we
breathe is mostly nitrogen gas (N ~2~ ), but, unfortunately, animals and
plants cannot use the nitrogen when it is a gas. In fact, plants often
die from a lack of nitrogen even through they are surrounded by plenty
of nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas (N ~2~ ) has two nitrogen atoms connected
by a very strong triple bond. Most plants and animals cannot use the
nitrogen in nitrogen gas because they cannot break that triple bond.

In order for plants to make use of nitrogen, it must be transformed into
molecules they can use. This can be accomplished several different ways
( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0xMC1OaXRyb2dlbi1jeWNsZQ..) ).

-   Lightning: When lightening strikes, nitrogen gas is transformed into
    nitrate (NO ~3~ ^-^ ) that plants can use.
-   **Nitrogen fixation** : Special nitrogen-fixing bacteria can also
    transform nitrogen gas into useful forms. These bacteria live in the
    roots of plants in the pea family. They turn the nitrogen gas into
    ammonium (NH ~4~ ^+^ ) (a process called ammonification). In water
    environments, bacteria in the water can also fix nitrogen gas
    into ammonium. Ammonium can be used by aquatic plants as a source
    of nitrogen.
-   Nitrogen also is released to the environment by decaying organisms
    or decaying wastes. These wastes release nitrogen in the form
    of ammonium.

Ammonium in the soil can be turned into nitrate by a two-step process
completed by two different types of bacteria. In the form of nitrate,
nitrogen can be used by plants through the process of **assimilation** .
It is then passed along to animals when they eat the plants.

#### Sending Nitrogen back to the Atmosphere {#13.html#x-ck12-U2VuZGluZyBOaXRyb2dlbiBiYWNrIHRvIHRoZSBBdG1vc3BoZXJl_21-pvb}

Turning nitrate back into nitrogen gas, the process of
**denitrification** , happens through the work of denitrifying bacteria.
These bacteria often live in swamps and lakes. They take in the nitrate
and release it back to the atmosphere as nitrogen gas.

Just like the carbon cycle, human activities impact the nitrogen cycle.
These human activities include the burning of fossil fuels, which
release nitrogen oxide gasses into the atmosphere. Releasing nitrogen
oxide back into the atmosphere leads to problems like **acid rain** .

**Figure 13.36**

The nitrogen cycle includes assimilation, when plants absorb nitrogen;
nitrogen-fixing bacteria that make the nitrogen available to plants in
the form of nitrates; decomposers that transform nitrogen in dead
organisms into ammonium; nitrifying bacteria that turn ammonium into
nitrates; and denitrifying bacteria that turn nitrates into gaseous
nitrogen.

**What will happen to this land?**

Since this land was clearcut, there is little life left behind. However,
that does not mean that this land will stay barren forever. First little
seedlings will establish themselves, and with time a forest could thrive
here once again.

### Succession {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VjY2Vzc2lvbg.._22-jga}

When you see an older forest, it’s easy to picture that the forest has
been there forever. This is not the case. Ecosystems are "dynamic." This
means that ecosystems change over time. That forest may lie on land that
was once covered by an ocean millions of years ago. Lightning may have
sparked a fire in a forest, destroying much of the plant life there. Or
the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use,
then abandoned and allowed to re-grow over time. During the ice ages,
glaciers once covered areas that are tropical rainforests today. Both
natural forces and human actions cause ecosystems to change.

If there is a big ecosystem change caused by natural forces or human
actions, the plants and animals that live there may be destroyed. Or
they may be forced to leave. Over time, a new **community** will
develop, and then that community may be replaced by another. You may see
several changes in the plant and animal composition of the community
over time. **Ecological succession** is the constant replacement of one
community by another. It happens after a big change in the ecosystem.
And, of course, succession occurs on brand new land.

#### Primary Succession {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJpbWFyeSBTdWNjZXNzaW9u_22-x1n}

**Primary succession** is the type of ecological succession that happens
on new lands—lands where life has not yet existed. Primary succession
can take place after lava flow cools and hardens into new land, or a
glacier recedes exposing new land. Since the land that results from
these processes is completely new land, soil must first be produced. How
is soil produced?

Primary succession always starts with a **pioneer species** . This is
the species that first lives in the habitat. If life is to begin on
barren rock, which is typical of new land, the pioneer species would be
an organism such as a lichen ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0xMS1MaWNoZW4.) ). A **lichen** is
actually an organism formed from two species. It results from a
symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria.
The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or
bacteria contribute to the relationship. The fungus is able to absorb
minerals and nutrients from the rock, while algae supplies the fungus
with sugars through **photosynthesis** . Since lichens can
photosynthesize and do not rely on soil, they can live in environments
where other organisms cannot. As a lichen grows, it breaks down the
rock, which is the first step of soil formation.

succession](ck12_13_files/20150911114113546214.jpeg "Lichen are often the first step in primary succession")

**Figure 13.37**

Primary succession on a rock often begins with the growth of lichens.
What do lichens help create?

</div>

The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic
factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the
species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will
be able to grow in the newly created soil. During early succession,
plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take
over the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few
shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small
trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are
more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a
forest may be the end result of primary succession.

#### Secondary Succession {#13.html#x-ck12-U2Vjb25kYXJ5IFN1Y2Nlc3Npb24._22-i9f}

Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already
existed. These areas already have soil full of nutrients. **Secondary
succession** is the type of succession that happens after something
destroys the habitat, such as a flood or other natural disaster.
Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to
secondary succession ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0xMi1zZWNvbmRhcnktc3VjY2Vzc2lvbg..) ).
In this case, the pioneer species would be the grasses that first
appear. Lichen would not be necessary as there is already nutrient-rich
soil. Slowly, the field would return to its natural state.

**Figure 13.38**

This land was once used for growing crops. Now that the field is
abandoned, secondary succession has begun. Pioneer species, such as

A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs

and **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0xNC1TdWNjZXNzaW9uLTI.)
). Although the area will look devastated at first, the seeds of new
plants are underground. They are waiting for their chance to grow. Just
like primary succession, the burned forest will go through a series of
communities, starting with small grasses, then shrubs, and finally
bigger trees.

#### Climax Communities {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF4IENvbW11bml0aWVz_22-am8}

A **climax community** ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNC0xNS1yZWR3b29kLWNsaW1heC1jb21tdW5pdHk.)
) is the end result of ecological succession. The climax community is a
stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem, and will remain stable
unless a disaster strikes. After the disaster, succession will start all
over again. Depending on the climate of the area, the climax community
will look different. In the tropics, the climax community might be a
tropical rainforest. At the other extreme, in northern parts of the
world, the climax community might be a coniferous forest. Though climax
communities are stable, are they truly the final community of the
habitat? Or is it likely that sometime in the future, maybe a long time
in the future, the community of populations will change, and another
stable, climax community will thrive?

**What is this haze?**

This picture shows a thick layer of smog and dust over a very polluted
city (Singapore). Smog in the air is a serious health hazard for people
living in many big cities around the globe. Smog is one example of air
pollution.

### Outdoor Air Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-T3V0ZG9vciBBaXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_23-itq}

Air is all around us. Air is essential for life. Sometimes, humans can
pollute the air. For example, releasing smoke and dust from factories
and cars can cause **air pollution** . Air pollution is due to chemical
substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions.
This pollution affects entire ecosystems around the world. Pollution can
also cause many human health problems, and it can also cause death. Air
pollution can be found both outdoors and indoors.

**Outdoor air pollution** is made of chemical particles. When smoke or
other pollutants enter the air, the particles found in the pollution mix
with the air. Air is polluted when it contains many large toxic
particles. Outdoor air pollution changes the natural characteristics of
the atmosphere. **Primary pollutants** are added directly to the
atmosphere. Fires add primary pollutants to the air. Particles released
from the fire directly enter the air and cause pollution ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0wMS1XaWxkZmlyZQ..) ). Burning of
**fossil fuels** such as oil and coal is a major source of primary
pollutants ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0wMi1idXJuaW5nLWZvc3NpbC1mdWVscw..) ).

**Secondary pollutants** are formed when primary pollutants interact
with sunlight, air, or each other. They do not directly cause pollution.
However, when they interact with other parts of the air, they do cause
pollution. For example, **ozone** is created when some pollutants
interact with sunlight. High levels of ozone in the atmosphere can cause
problems for humans.

</div>

#### Sources of Outdoor Air Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBPdXRkb29yIEFpciBQb2xsdXRpb24._23-5b9}

Most air pollutants can be traced to the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil
fuels are burned during many processes, including in power plants to
create electricity, in factories to make machinery run, in power stoves
and furnaces for heating, and in waste facilities. Perhaps one of the
biggest uses of fossil fuels is in transportation. Fossil fuels are used
in cars, trains, and planes.

Air pollution can also be caused by agriculture, such as cattle ranching
and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Other sources of air
pollution include the production of plastics, refrigerants, and
aerosols, in nuclear power and defense, from landfills and mining, and
from biological warfare.

#### Acid Rain {#13.html#x-ck12-QWNpZCBSYWlu_23-oj8}

One result of air pollution is acid rain. **Acid rain** is precipitation
with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife.
When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can
kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very
low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid
rain to form ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0wMy1hY2lkLXJhaW4tZWZmZWN0cw..) ).
Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power
plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.

#### Global Warming {#13.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFdhcm1pbmc._23-uhw}

Pollutants also affect the atmosphere through their contribution to
global warming. **Global warming** is an increase in the Earth’s
temperature. It is thought to be caused mostly by the increase of
**greenhouse gases** like carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases can be
released by factories that burn fossil fuels. Over the past 20 years,
burning fossil fuels has produced about three-quarters of the carbon
dioxide from human activity. The rest of the carbon dioxide in the

Trees absorb carbon dioxide during cellular respiration, so when trees
are cut down, they cannot remove carbon dioxide from the air.

This increase in global temperature will cause the sea level to rise. It
is also expected to produce an increase in extreme weather events and
change the amount of precipitation. Global warming may also cause food
shortages and species extinction.

**How do you paint safely?**

If you are painting indoors, there are more important concerns than just
getting messy. You should also be concerned about breathing in the fumes
from the paints. Making sure to get plenty of fresh air while painting
is very important. Paint fumes can have serious health effects. Paint
fumes are just one example of indoor air pollution.

### Indoor Air Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-SW5kb29yIEFpciBQb2xsdXRpb24._24-xzj}

Recall that **air pollution** is due to chemical substances and
particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most
people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But
it is just as easy to have **indoor air pollution.** Your home or school
classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home
reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to
stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their
time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a
significant health risk.

Indoor air pollutants include both chemical and biological pollutants.
Chemical pollutants include the following:

-   **Radon** , a radioactive gas released from the Earth in
    certain locations. It can become trapped inside buildings and
    increase your risk of cancer.
-   Formaldehyde, a toxic gas emitted from building materials, such as
    carpeting and plywood.
-   **Volatile organic compounds** (VOCs), which are given off by paint
    and solvents as they dry. They can cause cause long-term
    health effects.
-   **Secondhand smoke** , which comes from breathing the smoke release
    from tobacco products. Secondhand smoke is also the smoke exhaled by
    a cigarette smoker. This smoke is extremely dangerous to
    human health.
-   **Carbon monoxide** (CO), a toxic gas released by burning
    fossil fuels. It is often released indoors by faulty chimneys,
    gas-powered generators, or burning charcoal; it can be
    extremely dangerous.
-   Dry cleaning fluids, such as tetrachloroethylene, which can be
    released from clothing days after dry cleaning.
-   The past use of **asbestos** in factories and in homes. Asbestos is
    a very dangerous material, and it was used in many buildings (
    **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0wNS1hc2Jlc3Rvcw..) ).
    Asbestos can cause cancer and other lung diseases. The use of
    asbestos is not allowed today.

**Figure 13.46**

The use of asbestos in industry and domestic environments in the past,
as in the asbestos-covered pipes in the oil-refining plant pictured
here, has left a potentially very dangerous material in many businesses.

</div>

Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors. These are
produced from:

-   Pet dander.
-   Dust from tiny skin flakes and decomposed hair.
-   Dust mites.
-   Mold from walls, ceilings, and other structures.
-   Air conditioning systems that can incubate certain bacteria
    and mold.
-   Pollen, dust, and mold from houseplants, soil, and
    surrounding gardens.

#### Limiting Exposure {#13.html#x-ck12-TGltaXRpbmcgRXhwb3N1cmU._24-dqg}

Can you avoid indoor air pollution? You can't go to school outside. But
it is possible to reduce your exposure to air pollution. Some tips to
decrease your exposure to indoor air pollution include:

-   Using less toxic chemicals when possible.
-   Limiting your exposure to pesticides and cleaning fluids by keeping
    them in a garage or shed.
-   When using toxic chemicals, allowing fresh air to circulate through
    open windows and doors.
-   Having detectors for radon and carbon monoxide in your home.

What else could you do to reduce your exposure to air pollution?

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-jqi}

-   Sources of indoor air pollution can include radon gas, carbon
    monoxide, and volatile organic compound (VOCs).
-   Biological sources of air pollution include molds, pollen, and
    pet dander.

**Why is this woman wearing a mask?**

In many cities around the world, the air quality is so poor that people
are often told to stay indoors when possible. When there is poor air
quality in a city, some people choose to wear face masks when they have
to be outdoors. Lowering exposure to air pollutants with a face mask is
especially important for people with existing heart or lung conditions.

### Health Hazards of Air Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-SGVhbHRoIEhhemFyZHMgb2YgQWlyIFBvbGx1dGlvbg.._25-twb}

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 2.4 million people die
each year from causes directly related to **air pollution** . This
includes both outdoor and indoor air pollution. Worldwide, there are
more deaths linked to air pollution each year than to car accidents.
Research by the WHO also shows that the worst air quality is in
countries with high poverty and population rates, such as Egypt, Sudan,
Mongolia, and Indonesia.

**Respiratory system** disorders are directly related to air pollution.
These disorders have severe effects on human health, some leading to
death directly related to air pollution. Air pollution related
respiratory disorders include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.
**Asthma** is a respiratory disorder characterized by wheezing,
coughing, and a feeling of constriction in the chest. **Bronchitis** is
inflammation of the membrane lining of the bronchial tubes of the lungs.
**Emphysema** is a deadly lung disease characterized by abnormal
enlargement of air spaces in the lungs and destruction of the lung
tissue. Additional lung and heart diseases are also related to air
pollution, as are respiratory allergies.

Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even
deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung
cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain
chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT
(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated
biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or
asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can
lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke.

#### Air Pollution in Cities {#13.html#x-ck12-QWlyIFBvbGx1dGlvbiBpbiBDaXRpZXM._25-zj5}

Certain respiratory conditions can be made worse in people who live
closer to or in large cites. Some studies have shown that people in
urban areas suffer lower levels of lung function and more chronic
bronchitis and emphysema. If you live in a city, you have seen **smog**
. It is a low-hanging, fog-like cloud that seems to never leave the city
( **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfZWd5cHQ.) ). Smog is caused
by coal burning and by **ozone** produced by motor vehicle exhaust. Smog
can cause eye irritation and respiratory problems.

#### Protecting Yourself from Air Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVjdGluZyBZb3Vyc2VsZiBmcm9tIEFpciBQb2xsdXRpb24._25-vxm}

After reading about the effects of air pollution, both indoors and
outdoors, you may wonder how you can avoid it. As for outdoor air
pollution, if you hear in the news that the outdoor air quality is
particularly bad, then it might make sense to wear a mask outdoors or to
stay indoors. Because you have more control over your indoor air quality
than the outdoor air quality, there are some simple steps you can take
indoors to make sure the air quality is less polluted. These include:

1.  Make sure that vents and chimneys are working properly, and never
    burn charcoal indoors.
2.  Place carbon monoxide detectors in the home.
3.  Keep your home as clean as possible from pet dander, dust, dust
    mites, and mold.
4.  Make sure air conditioning systems are working properly.

Are there any other ways you can think of to protect yourself from air
pollution?

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-2at}

-   Air-pollution can directly cause deaths due to illnesses like asthma
    and emphysema or indirectly cause deaths by increasing your risk
    of cancer.
-   There are steps you can take to decrease your exposure to indoor air
    pollution, such as having carbon monoxide detectors in your home and
    keeping your home as clean as possible from pet dander, dust, dust
    mites, and mold.

**Is the ocean a good dumping ground?**

Unfortunately some people think so. A lot of garbage ends up washing
ashore, and some garbage stays floating out in the ocean. Animals can be
strangled by floating trash or mistake inedible trash for food. Not only
is the pollution of our oceans a problem, but also our precious
freshwater resources are often polluted.

### Sources of Water Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBXYXRlciBQb2xsdXRpb24._26-ddv}

While to many people clean water may seem limitless and everywhere, to
many others this is not so. **Water pollution** is a serious issue
facing hundreds of millions of people world-wide, having harmful effects
on the lives of those people. Water is not in unlimited supply and
cannot just be made fresh when it is wanted. Water is actually a limited
resource, and for many people, fresh, unpolluted water is hard to find.
A **limited resource** is one that we use faster than we can remake it.
It is a resource that can be used up.

Water pollution happens when contaminants enter water bodies.
**Contaminants** are any substances that harm the health of the
environment or humans. Most contaminants enter the water because of
humans. Surface water (river or lake) can be exposed to and contaminated
by acid rain, storm water runoff, pesticide runoff, and industrial
waste. This water is cleaned somewhat by exposure to sunlight, aeration,
and microorganisms in the water. **Groundwater** (private wells and some
public water supplies) generally takes longer to become contaminated,
but the natural cleaning process also may take much longer. Groundwater
can be contaminated by disease-producing pathogens, careless disposal of
hazardous household chemical-containing products, agricultural
chemicals, and leaking underground storage tanks.

health](ck12_13_files/20150911114116865411.jpeg "Water pollution causes detrimental effects to both ecology and human health")

**Figure 13.48**

Water pollution can cause harmful effects to ecology and human health.
Shown is the pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia.

</div>

Natural events, like storms, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes can
cause major changes in water quality. But human-caused contaminants have
a much greater impact on the quality of the water supply. Water is
considered polluted either when it does not support a human use, like
clean drinking water, or a use for other animals and plants. The
overgrowth of algae, known as an **algal bloom** , can result from the
runoff of fertilizer into bodies of water. This excess of nutrients
allows the algae to grow beyond control, bring harm to the rest of the
ecosystem.

The main sources of water pollution can be grouped into two categories:

-   **Point source pollution** results from the contaminants that enter
    a waterway or water body through a single site. Examples of this
    include untreated sewage, wastewater from a sewage treatment plant,
    and leaking underground tanks.
-   **Nonpoint source pollution** is contamination that does not come
    from a single point source. Instead, it happens when there is a
    buildup of small amounts of contaminants that collect from a
    large area. Examples of this include fertilizer runoff from many
    farms flowing into groundwater or streams.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-l2z}

-   Water is a limited resource, but it is often polluted by humans.
-   Sources of water pollution can be grouped as point source pollution
    (large amounts entering through a single site) or nonpoint source
    pollution (small amounts entering from many sites.)

**Can water have too many nutrients?**

Excess nutrients can cause algae to grow like crazy. Too much algae
causes the green slime on the water that you see in this picture. These
excess nutrients come from fertilizers that were carried by the runoff
from farmland. This type of water pollution can have serious
consequences for the other forms of life trying to survive here.

### Effects of Water Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBXYXRlciBQb2xsdXRpb24._27-szz}

Water pollutants can have an effect on both the ecology of ecosystems
and on humans. As a result of water pollution, humans may not be able to
use a waterway for recreation and fishing. Drinking water can also be
affected if a toxin enters the groundwater.

#### Eutrophication {#13.html#x-ck12-RXV0cm9waGljYXRpb24._27-bza}

In a marine ecosystem, algae are the producers. Through photosynthesis,
they provide glucose for the ecosystem. So, can too much algae be a bad
thing? **Eutrophication** is an over-enrichment of chemical nutrients in
a body of water. Usually these nutrients are the nitrogen and
phosphorous found in fertilizers. Run-off from lawns or farms can wash
fertilizers into rivers or coastal waters.

Plants are not the only things that grow more quickly with added
fertilizers. Algae like the excess nutrients in fertilizers too. When
there are high levels of nutrients in the water, algae populations will
grow large very quickly. This leads to overgrowths of algae called
**algal blooms** . However, these algae do not live very long. They die
and begin to decompose. This process uses oxygen, removing the oxygen
from the water. Without oxygen, fish and shellfish cannot live, and this
results in the death of these organisms ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0wOC1ncmVlbi1hbGdhbC1ibG9vbQ..) ).

Certain types of algal blooms can also create toxins. These toxins can
enter shellfish. If humans eat these shellfish, then they can get very
sick. These toxins cause neurological problems in humans.

#### Ocean Acidification {#13.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4gQWNpZGlmaWNhdGlvbg.._27-go2}

**Ocean acidification** occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has
led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon
dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the
water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also
cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other
organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine
organisms for humans to consume.

#### Aquatic Debris {#13.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBEZWJyaXM._27-cx9}

Aquatic debris is trash that gets into fresh- and saltwater waterways.
It comes from shipping accidents, landfill erosion, or the direct
dumping of trash. Debris can be very dangerous to aquatic wildlife. Some
animals may swallow plastic bags, mistaking them for food. Other animals
can be strangled by floating trash like plastic six-pack rings. Wildlife
can easily get tangled in nets ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0wOS1tYXJpbmUtdHJhc2g.) ).

#### Waterborne Diseases {#13.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXJib3JuZSBEaXNlYXNlcw.._27-1zj}

Unsafe water supplies have drastic effects on human health. **Waterborne
diseases** are diseases due to microscopic **pathogens** in fresh water.
These diseases can be caused by protozoa, viruses, bacteria, and
intestinal parasites. In many parts of the world there are no water
treatment plants. If sewage or animal manure gets into a river, then
people downstream will get sick when they drink the water. According to
the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is responsible
for the deaths of 1.8 million people every year. It was estimated that
88% of the cases of diarrheal disease are caused by unsafe water
supplies.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-94p}

-   High levels of nutrients, called eutrophication, can cause
    conditions that deprive fish of oxygen.
-   Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the
    atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic, which harms corals
    and shellfish.
-   Debris can be dangerous to aquatic wildlife.

**Do we have an infinite supply of drinkable water?**

No. In fact, in many parts of the world, finding clean drinkable water
is difficult. This can lead to various serious health issues. Hundreds
of millions of people world-wide are thought to live in areas where
obtaining safe water is difficult. This makes preserving water resources
an important global issue.

### Preserving Water Sources {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJlc2VydmluZyBXYXRlciBTb3VyY2Vz_28-t7x}

It might seem like there is plenty of water on Earth, but that's not
really the case. Water is a **limited resource.** That means that it is
used faster than it is replaced. Theoretically, at some point in time,
the supply of fresh water could run out. Though this is unlikely, it is
possible. But it is a significant issue in parts of the world with large
populations. As these populations continue to grow, the supply of water
becomes an increasingly important issue.

Even though we have lots of water in our oceans, we cannot use that
water whenever we want. It takes special equipment, such as a
desalination plant, and a lot of energy (and money) to convert salt
water into fresh water. Of all the water on Earth, only about 1% can be
used for drinking water. Almost all of the rest of the water is either
salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps. As a result,
there are water shortages many places in the world. Since we have such a
limited supply of water, it is important to preserve our water supplies.
Therefore, steps have been taken to prevent water pollution.
Technologies have also been developed to conserve water and prevent
**water pollution** .

Sub-Saharan African countries have the most vulnerable water supplies.
Some scientists believe of a potential future crisis in both Asia and
Africa from pollution and depletion of natural water resources. Many
countries in the Middle East are at an extreme risk of water shortages.
Diminished water supplies could increase the risk of both internal
conflicts or wars between countries.

#### Preventing Water Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBXYXRlciBQb2xsdXRpb24._28-2uk}

In the U.S., concern over water pollution has resulted in many federal
laws. Some of these laws go all the way back to the 1800s! The laws
prohibit the disposal of any waste into the nation’s rivers, lakes,
streams, and other bodies of water, unless a person first has a permit.
Growing concern for controlling water pollutants led to the enactment of
the Clean Water Act in 1972. The **Clean Water Act** set water quality
standards. It also limits the pollution that can enter the waterways.
Other countries are also actively preventing water pollution and
purifying water ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xMC13YXRlci1wdXJpZmljYXRpb24.) ).

#### Wastewater Treatment {#13.html#x-ck12-V2FzdGV3YXRlciBUcmVhdG1lbnQ._28-brh}

Fresh water is also preserved by purifying wastewater. **Wastewater** is
water that has been used for cleaning, washing, flushing, or
manufacturing. It includes the water that goes down your shower drain
and that is flushed down your toilet. Instead of dumping wastewater
directly into rivers, wastewater can be purified at a water treatment
plant ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xMS1zYW5kLXByb2Nlc3NpbmctbWlsbA..) ).
When wastewater is recycled, **waterborne diseases** caused by
**pathogens** in sewage can be prevented. What are some ways you can
save water in your own house?

**Can we use up all of our sunlight?**

No, we have a limitless supply of sunlight. That makes it a renewable
resource. Products derived from fossil fuels, like the gasoline we use
to drive our cars, are not renewable resources. We will eventually run
out of fossil fuels.

### Renewable Resources and Alternative Energy Sources {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcyBhbmQgQWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUgRW5lcmd5IFNvdXJjZXM._29-hzv}

A resource is *renewable* if it is remade by natural processes at the
same rate that humans use it up. Sunlight and wind are **renewable
resources** because they will not be used up ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xMy13aW5kLXBvd2Vy) ). The rising and
falling of ocean tides is another example of a resource in unlimited
supply. A **sustainable resource** is a resource that is used in a way
that meets the needs of the present without keeping future generations
from meeting their needs. People can sustainably harvest wood, cork, and
bamboo. Farmers can also grow crops sustainably by not planting the same
crop in their soil year after year. Planting the same crop each year can
remove nutrients from the soil. This means that wood, cork, bamboo, and
crops can be sustainable resources.

### Alternative Energy Sources {#13.html#x-ck12-QWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUgRW5lcmd5IFNvdXJjZXM._29-l3m}

A **nonrenewable resource** is one that cannot be replaced as easily as
it is consumed. Fossil fuels are an example of nonrenewable resources.
They take millions of years to form naturally, and so they cannot be
replaced as fast as they are consumed. To take the place of fossil fuel
use, alternative energy resources are being developed. These alternative
energy sources often utilize renewable resources. The following are
examples of sustainable alternative energy resources:

-   **Solar power** , which uses solar cells to turn sunlight into
    electricity ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xNi1Tb2xhci1wYW5lbHM.) ). The
    electricity can be used to power anything that uses normal
    coal-generated electricity.

</div>

-   **Wind power** , which uses windmills to transform wind energy
    into electricity. It is used for less than 1% of the world’s
    energy needs. But wind energy is growing fast. Every year, 30% more
    wind energy is used to create electricity.
-   **Hydropower** ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xNy1oeWRyb3Bvd2VyLXBsYW50) ),
    which uses the energy of moving water to turn turbines (similar
    to windmills) or water wheels, that create electricity. This form of
    energy produces no waste or pollution. It is a renewable resource.

-   **Geothermal power** , which uses the natural flow of heat from the
    Earth’s core to produce steam. This steam is used to turn turbines
    which create electricity.
-   **Biomass** is the mass of biological organisms. It is usually used
    to describe the amount of organic matter in a trophic level of
    an ecosystem. **Biomass production** involves using organic
    matter ("biomass") from plants to create electricity. Using corn to
    make ethanol fuel is an example of biomass generated energy. Biomass
    is generally renewable.
-   Tides in the ocean can also turn a turbine to create electricity.
    This energy can then be stored until needed ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xOC10aWRhbC1wb3dlci1wbGFudA..) ).

**Could we all run out of gasoline?**

Yes, we will use up all our gasoline eventually. Gasoline is derived
from oil. Oil deposits were formed over hundreds of millions of years.
They cannot be quickly replenished. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable
resource.

### Nonrenewable Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-Tm9ucmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcw.._30-pgy}

A **nonrenewable resource** is a natural resource that is consumed or
used up faster than it can be made by nature. Two main types of
nonrenewable resources are fossil fuels and nuclear power. **Fossil
fuels** , such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, formed from plant
and animal remains over periods from 50 to 350 million years ago. They
took millions of years to form. Humans have been consuming fossil fuels
for less than 200 years, yet remaining reserves of oil can supply our
needs only until around the year 2055. Natural gas can only supply us
until around 2085. Coal will last longer, until around the year 2250.
That is why it is so important to develop alternate forms of energy,
especially for our cars. Today, electric cars are becoming more and more
common. What would happen if we ran out of gasoline? Alternative use of
energy, especially in transportation, must become a standard feature of
all cars and trucks and planes by the middle of the century.

**Nuclear power** is the use of nuclear energy ( **nuclear fission** )
to create energy inside of a nuclear reactor ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xOS1udWNsZWFyLWdlbmVyYXRpbmctc3RhdGlvbg..)
). Nuclear power is developed from atoms in certain elements, such as
uranium. Currently, there are limited uranium fuel supplies, which will
last to about the year 2100 (or longer) at current rates of use.
However, new technologies could make some uranium fuel reserves more
useful.

Population growth, especially in developing countries, should make
people think about how fast they are consuming resources. Governments
around the world should seriously consider these issues. Developing
nations will also increase demands on natural resources as they build
more factories ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0xNS1lbmVyZ3ktY29uc3VtcHRpb24.) ).
Improvements in technology, conservation of resources, and controls in
population growth could all help to decrease the demand on natural
resources.

individual creates is small in proportion to all the waste produced by
society. Yet all small contributions, when added up, make a difference.

### Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVkdWNl_31LCBSZXVzZSwgYW5kIFJlY3ljbGU._31-ubq}

Why conserve resources? During your lifetime, it is possible that the
world may run out of some **nonrenewable resources** , especially as the
population passes 8 then 9 billion people. So it is necessary to try to
make these resources last as long as possible. You may have heard people
say, "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." You may know that this is the slogan of
the campaign to conserve resources. But what do each one of those words
truly mean?

#### Reduce {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVkdWNl_31-dgv}

What exactly does it mean to **reduce** ? Reducing means decreasing the
amount of waste we create. That could also mean cutting down on use of
natural resources. Minimizing of waste may be difficult to achieve for
individuals and households, but here are some starting points that you
can include in your daily routine to reduce the use of resources:

-   Turn lights off when not using them.
-   Turn the television off when no one is watching.
-   Replace burned out bulbs with ones that are more energy-efficient (
    **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNfTFNfbGlnaHRidWxi) ).
-   Reduce water use by turning off faucets when not using water.
-   Use low-flow shower heads, which save on water and use less energy.
-   Use low-flush and composting toilets.
-   Put kitchen and garden waste into a compost pile.
-   In the summer, change filters on your air conditioner and use as
    little air conditioning as possible. The use of air conditioning
    uses a lot of energy.
-   In winter, make sure your furnace is working properly and make sure
    there is enough insulation on windows and doors.
-   Mend broken or worn items instead of buying new ones.
-   When you go shopping for items, buy quantities you know you will use
    without waste.
-   Walk or bicycle instead of using an automobile, in order to save on
    fuel usage and costs, and to cut down on pollution.
-   When buying a new vehicle, check into hybrid, semi-hybrid, or
    electric models to cut down on gas usage and air pollution.

These fluorescent light bulbs are much more energy efficient than
standard light bulbs.

</div>

#### Reuse {#13.html#x-ck12-UmV1c2U._31-wrn}

Let’s now look at what we can **reuse** . Reusing includes using the
same item again for the same function and also using an item again for a
new function. Reuse can have both economic and environmental benefits.
New packaging regulations are helping society to move towards these
goals. Some ways of reusing resources include:

-   Use reusable bags when shopping.
-   Use gray water. Water that has been used for laundry, for example,
    can be used to water the garden or flush toilets.
-   At the town level, purified sewage water can be used for fountains,
    watering public parks or golf courses, fire fighting, and
    irrigating crops.
-   Rain can be caught in rain barrels and used to water your garden.

What are some other ways to reuse resources?

#### Recycle {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVjeWNsZQ.._31-ufq}

Now we move on to **recycle.** Sometimes it may be difficult to
understand the differences between reusing and recycling. Recycling
involves processing used materials in order to make them suitable for
other uses. That usually means taking a used item, breaking it down, and
reusing the pieces. Even though recycling requires extra energy, it does
often make use of items which are broken, worn out, or cannot be reused.

The things that are commonly recycled include:

-   Batteries.
-   Biodegradable waste.
-   Electronics.
-   Iron and steel.
-   Aluminum ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0yMC1SZWN5Y2xpbmc.) ).
-   Glass.
-   Paper.
-   Plastic.
-   Textiles, such as clothing.
-   Timber.
-   Tires.

**Figure 13.60**

These aluminum cans are packed together in a recycling plant to be
reused.

</div>

Each type of recyclable requires a different recycling technique. Here
are some things you can do to recycle in your home, school, or
community:

-   If you have recycling in your community, make sure you separate
    aluminum, plastics, glass, and paper products.
-   See if your school recycles. If not, you and some friends could
    start a recycling club, or organize efforts to better
    recycling goals.

Laws can also be created to make sure people and companies reduce,
reuse, and recycle. Individuals can vote for leaders who stand for
sustainable ecological practices. They can also tell their leaders to
make wise use of **natural resources** . You can also influence
companies. If you and your family only buy from companies and
restaurants that support recycling or eco-friendly packaging, then other
companies will also change to be more environmentally friendly.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._31-dzw}

-   Reducing waste, as well as reusing and recycling resources, can help
    save natural resources
-   Consumers can influence companies to become more
    environmentally friendly.

**What's happening to this land?**

This picture, taken in southern Mexico, shows land being cleared for
agriculture. The forest has been cut down and burned to make room for a
a farm. In the process, homes to many plants and animals were destroyed.
This is an example of habitat destruction.

### Habitat Destruction {#13.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdCBEZXN0cnVjdGlvbg.._32-fxb}

From a human point of view, a habitat is where you live, go to school,
and go to have fun. Your habitat can be altered, and you can easily
adapt. Most people live in a few different places and go to a number of
different schools throughout their life. But a plant or animal may not
be able to adapt to a changed habitat. A **habitat** is the natural home
or environment of an organism. Humans often destroy the habitats of
other organisms. Habitat destruction can cause the extinction of
species. **Extinction** is the complete disappearance of a species. Once
a species is extinct, it can never recover. Some ways humans cause
habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native
species of plants and animals.

#### Land Loss {#13.html#x-ck12-TGFuZCBMb3Nz_32-dhz}

Clearing land for agriculture and development is a major cause of
habitat destruction. Within the past 100 years, the amount of total land
used for agriculture has almost doubled. Land used for grazing cattle
has more than doubled. Agriculture alone has cost the United States half
of its wetlands ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0yNi13ZXRsYW5kcw..) ) and almost all
of its tallgrass prairies. Native prairie ecosystems, with their thick
fertile soils, deep-rooted grasses, diversity of colorful flowers,
burrowing prairie dogs, and herds of bison and other animals, have
virtually disappeared ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0yOC1wcmFpcmllLWJpc29u) ).

#### Slash-and-Burn Agriculture {#13.html#x-ck12-U2xhc2gtYW5kLUJ1cm4gQWdyaWN1bHR1cmU._32-gh2}

Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests, especially
tropical rainforests. The largest cause of deforestation today is
**slash-and-burn agriculture** (shown in the opening image). This means
that when people want to turn a forest into a farm, they cut down all of
the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest. This technique is
used by over 200 million people in tropical forests throughout the
world.

As a consequence of slash-and-burn agriculture, nutrients are quickly
lost from the soil. This often results in people abandoning the land
within a few years. Then the top soil erodes and desertification can
follow. **Desertification** turns forest into a desert, where it is
difficult for plants to grow. Half of the Earth’s mature tropical
forests are gone. At current rates of deforestation, all tropical
forests will be gone by the year 2090.

#### Non-native Species {#13.html#x-ck12-Tm9uLW5hdGl2ZSBTcGVjaWVz_32-wck}

One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species
into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called
**invasive species** or **non-native species** . These non-native
species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new
habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow.
Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes
invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that
the native species go extinct ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0yNS1icm93bi10cmVlLXNuYWtl) ).

Recently, cargo ships have transported zebra mussels, spiny waterfleas,
and ruffe (a freshwater fish) into the Great Lakes ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0yOS16ZWJyYS1tdXNzZWxz) ). These
invasive species are better at hunting for food. They have caused some
of the native species to go extinct.

Invasive species can disrupt food chains, carry disease, prey on native
species directly, and out-compete native species for limited resources,
like food. All of these effects can lead to extinction of the native
species.

#### Other Causes {#13.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgQ2F1c2Vz_32-jns}

Other causes of habitat destruction include poor fire management,
overfishing, mining ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0zMC1zdHJpcC1jb2FsLW1pbmluZw..) ),
pollution, and storm damage. All of these can cause irreversible changes

#### Examples of Habitat Destruction {#13.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgSGFiaXRhdCBEZXN0cnVjdGlvbg.._32-pli}

A habitat that is quickly being destroyed is the **wetland** . By the
1980s, over 80% of all wetlands in parts of the U.S. were destroyed. In
Europe, many wetland species have gone extinct. For example, many
**bogs** in Scotland have been lost because of human development.

Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on
Madagascar’s central highland plateau. From 1970 to 2000, slash-and-burn
agriculture destroyed about 10% of the country’s total native plants.
The area turned into a wasteland. Soil from erosion entered the
waterways. Much of the river ecosystems of several large rivers were
also destroyed. Several fish species are almost extinct. Also, some
coral reef formations in the Indian Ocean are completely lost.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._32-pcl}

-   There are many causes of habitat destruction, including clearing of
    land and introduction of invasive species.
-   Slash-and-burn agriculture can lead to desertification, meaning the
    fertile top soil is lost.

**Why are these polar bears threatened?**

These polar bears are threatened because of global warming. They depend
on the sea ice for their hunting grounds, and this ice is melting away.
Plus bears have to make a longer and more hazardous journey to get to
the remaining ice.

### Other Causes of Extinction {#13.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgQ2F1c2VzIG9mIEV4dGluY3Rpb24._33-kix}

In addition to habitat destruction, other human-caused problems are also
threatening many species. These include issues associated with climate
change, pollution, and over-population.

#### Global Warming {#13.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFdhcm1pbmc._33-e9x}

Another major cause of extinction is **global warming** , which is also
known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's
average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not
think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and
are constantly adapting to their environments, any **climate** change
can be hazardous. Recall that burning **fossil fuels** releases gasses
into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil
fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any
long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species.
Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to
survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly,
it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.

#### Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-UG9sbHV0aW9u_33-jfw}

Pollution adds chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment.
This can have many different harmful effects on all kinds of organisms.
For example, the pesticide DDT nearly eliminated the peregrine falcon in
some parts of the world. This pesticide caused falcons to lay eggs with
thinner shells. As a result, fewer falcon eggs survived to hatching.
Populations of peregrine falcons declined rapidly. DDT was then banned
in the U.S. and peregrine falcon populations have recovered.

Water pollution threatens vital freshwater and marine resources
throughout the world ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0zMS1vaWxlZC1iaXJk) ). Specifically,
industrial and agricultural chemicals, waste, and **acid rain** threaten
water. As water is essential for all ecosystems, water pollution can
result in the extinction of species.

November, 2007.

</div>

Finally, soil contamination can also result in extinction. Soil
contamination can come from toxic industrial and municipal wastes (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0zMi10YXItc29pbC1jb250YW1pbmF0aW9u) ),
salts from irrigation, and pesticides from agriculture. These all
degrade the soil as well. As soil is the foundation of terrestrial
ecosystems, this can result in extinction.

#### Human Overpopulation {#13.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gT3ZlcnBvcHVsYXRpb24._33-r5g}

Human populations are on the rise. The human population passed the 7
billion mark in October of 2011, and will pass 8 and 9 billion probably
before the middle of the century. All these people will need resources
such as places to live, food to eat, and water to drink, and they will
use energy and create waste. Essentially, human population growth can
effect all other causes of extinction. For example, more people on the
Earth means more people contributing to global warming and pollution.
More people also means more clearing of land for agriculture and
development. Recall that development by humans often causes habitats to
be destroyed. This destruction can force species to go extinct, or move
somewhere else.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-spf}

-   Global climate change is a major cause of extinctions.
-   Pollution of chemicals, noise, heat, or even light to an environment

**Why is preserving the rainforest important?**

Preserving the rainforest is important for many reasons. But one reason
conservation efforts have focused here is that the rainforest is home to
more species of insects, amphibians, and birds than anywhere else on the
planet. This wide diversity of life is called biodiversity.

### Importance of Biodiversity {#13.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBCaW9kaXZlcnNpdHk._34-sqb}

**Biodiversity** is a measurement of the amount of variation of the
species in a given area. More specifically, biodiversity can be defined
as the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of
living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the
communities and ecosystems in which they occur.

A place such as a coral reef has many different species of plants and
animals. That means the coral reef is a ecosystem with high biodiversity
( **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0yMi1jb3JhbC1yZWVmcw..)
). Because of its biodiversity, the rainforest shown above is an
ecosystem with extreme importance. Why is biodiversity so important? In
addition to maintaining the health and stability of the ecosystem, the
diversity of life provides us with many benefits.

**Extinction** is a threat to biodiversity. Does it matter if we are
losing thousands of species each year? The answer is yes. It matters
even if we consider not only the direct benefits to humans, but also the
benefits to the ecosystems. The health and survival of ecosystems is
related to that ecosystem's biodiversity.

#### Economic Importance {#13.html#x-ck12-RWNvbm9taWMgSW1wb3J0YW5jZQ.._34-jmz}

Economically, there are many direct benefits of biodiversity. As many as
40,000 species of fungi, plants, and animals provide us with many varied
types of clothing, shelter, medicines and other products. These include
poisons, timber, fibers, fragrances, papers, silks, dyes, adhesives,
rubber, resins, skins, furs, and more. According to one survey, 57% of
the most important prescription drugs come from nature. Specifically,
they come from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0zNC1zcGlyaW4td2hpdGUtd2lsbG93) ). But
only a small amount of species with the ability to give us medicines
have been explored. The loss of any species may mean the loss of new
medicines, which will have a direct effect on human health.

#### Biodiversity and Technology {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvZGl2ZXJzaXR5IGFuZCBUZWNobm9sb2d5_34-81v}

Nature has inspired many technologies in use today. **Bionics** , also
known as biomimetics or biomimicry, uses organisms to inspire technology
or engineering projects. By studying animals and their traits, we are
able to gain valuable information that we can put to use to help us. For
example, rattlesnake heat-sensing pits helped inspire the development of
infrared sensors. Zimbabwe’s Eastgate Centre ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0zNS1lYXN0Z2F0ZS1jZW50cmU.) ) was
inspired by the air-conditioning efficiency of a termite mound (
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0yNS0zNi10ZXJtaXRlLW1vdW5k) ).

#### Ecological Importance {#13.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9naWNhbCBJbXBvcnRhbmNl_34-b05}

Biodiversity also has many benefits to ecosystems. High biodiversity
makes ecosystems more stable. What can happen to an ecosystem if just
one species goes extinct? What if that one species was a **producer** or
**decomposer** ? Would the loss of a producer have an effect on all the
organisms that relied on that producer? If a decomposer vanishes, are
there other decomposers to fill the void? Maybe the resulting species
will adapt. Other species may fill in the **niche** left by the extinct
species. But the extinction of one species could have a "domino" effect,
resulting in the extinction of other species. This could greatly effect
the stability of the whole ecosystem.

One important role of biodiversity is that it helps keep the nutrients,
such as nitrogen, in the soil. For example, a diversity of organisms in
the soil allows **nitrogen fixation** and nutrient recycling to happen.
Biodiversity also allows plants to be pollinated by different types of
insects. And of course, different species of fungi are necessary to
recycle wastes from dead plants and animals. These are just a few of the
many examples of how biodiversity is important for ecosystems.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._34-zn8}

## Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-cya}

Ecology is the study of ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the
living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and
certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just
one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are
centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from
new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species,
and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving
factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of
that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the
stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human
population have raised many important ecological issues.
