**The Big Idea**

Units identify what a specific number represents. For example, the
number 42 can be used to represent 42 miles, 42 pounds, or 42 elephants!
Without the units attached, the number is meaningless. Also, correct
unit cancellation can help you find mistakes when you work out problems.

**Key Concepts**

-   Every calculation and answer to a physics problem must
    include units. Even if a problem explicitly asks for a speed in
    meters per second (m/s), the answer is 5 m/s, not 5.
-   When you’re not sure how to attack a problem, you can often find the
    appropriate equation by thinking about which equation will provide
    an answer with the correct units. For instance, if you are looking
    to predict or calculate a distance, use the equation where all the
    units cancel out, with only a unit of distance remaining.
-   This book uses *SI units* (La Système International d’Unités).
-   When converting speeds from one set of units to another, remember
    the following rule of thumb: a speed measured in *mi/hr* is about a
    little more than double the value measured in *m/s* ( *i.e.* , 10
    m/s is equal to about 20 MPH). Remember that the speed itself hasn’t
    changed, just our representation of the speed in a certain set
    of units.
-   If a unit is named after a person, it is capitalized. So you write
    “10 Newtons,” or “10 N,” but “10 meters,” or “10 m.”
-   Your weight is simply the force of gravity on you, so pounds are
    just the English version of Newtons

**Key Equations**

-   1 meter = 3.28 feet
-   1 mile = 1.61 kilometers
-   1 lb. (1 pound) = 4.45 Newtons
-   1 kg is equivalent to 2.21 lb. on Earth where acceleration of
    gravity is ![9.8 \\
    m/s\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/9ffc6b31624c4902ddc77b172d4520de.png)

**An Example of unit conversion:**

20 m/s = ? mi/hr

20 m/s (1 mi/1600 m) = .0125 mi/s

.0125 mi/s (60 s/min) = .75 mi/min

.75 mi/min (60 min/hr) = 45 mi/hr

**Calculator 101 –TI83**

-   **Arrow Keys:** Use the arrow keys to scroll around on the line that
    your typing your calculation and use the DEL key to delete anything.
    Use the insert key (type
    ![2\^{\\text{nd}}](ck12_math_images_dir/5ad5e1cd97a6b78074fe7f78bf3be4f4.png)
    then DEL) to add something in.
-   **Calculator only does what you tell it to:** The order of operation
    is as follows and in order: exponents, multiplication and division,
    adding and subtracting.
-   **Some useful tips:** The orange key in the upper left corner is
    very handy. If you hit this button first and then another key, the
    calculator will operate the command in orange above the key. Here
    are some good ones

    to type in 3E8, which means 3 times ten to the eighth power. You get
    the ‘E’ by hitting the
    ![\\boxed{2\^{\\text{nd}}}](ck12_math_images_dir/b4711fb17cc97fa5ee8e0c42f0867be7.png)
    then
    ![\\boxed{,}](ck12_math_images_dir/ec7ea4819774d8a7c6b4f9bd4240f7bc.png) .
-   **Common Problems:** *Student wants to divide 400 by* ![2
    \\pi](ck12_math_images_dir/88bc22e47b24f9566eb922d20b2e3aa9.png) ,
    but types ‘ ![400/2
    \\pi](ck12_math_images_dir/9da12518b253ab3c3b9e68c104b10788.png) ’
    into calculator. The calculator reads this as ‘400 divided by 2 and
    multiplied by
    ![\\pi](ck12_math_images_dir/1fade34c96ba066610f5f4ab48d3152c.png) ’.
    What you should do is either ‘
    ![400/(2 \\pi)](ck12_math_images_dir/d339402cb506f752ea7298caa0d18802.png)
    ’ or ‘
    ![400/2](ck12_math_images_dir/a79c618f100fe85500f806538eae9c1e.png)
    ’ enter then ‘
    ![/\\pi](ck12_math_images_dir/5f8d566523a81efba3828ff3abca12fa.png)
    ’ enter.

<dl id="x-ck12-MzQ2Nzc0ODM3YzdkZmJiYjlhYTM5OTM0OWY2Mzk1YzY.-zlk">
<dd>
*Student wants multiply 12 by the result of 365-90,* but types in ‘
![12\*365-9](ck12_math_images_dir/f13c210eb5b85fe1b8b2b5fe5d0acd4f.png)
’. The calculator multiplies 12 by 365 *then* subtracts 90. What you
should do is type in ‘
![12\*(365-90)](ck12_math_images_dir/06d158dcc49cc4a78344484569127f3c.png)
’.
</dd>
<dd>
*Student types in a long series of operations on the calculator, hits
enter and realizes the answer is not right.* Solution is to do one
operation at a time. For example, instead of typing in ‘ ![2E3\*10/\\pi
+ 45\*7 - 5](ck12_math_images_dir/d2fa4a92d2c69d217fc0847153f1717f.png)
’. Type in
![2E3](ck12_math_images_dir/d910023dc1dfbfbaa47d2c5cc8d9ef2a.png) , hit
enter then hit ‘
![x](ck12_math_images_dir/0f14991bebd0bc5ca2e82990e029d525.png) ’ key
then ‘10, hit enter, etc. Note that Answer will automatically appear if
start a line with an operation (like adding, subtracting, multiplying,
dividing)’.
</dd>
<dd>
*Make sure you are in degree mode:* hit the ‘MODE’ key and then use the
arrow to highlight ‘Degree’ and hit ENTER.
</dd>
<dd>
*Negative Exponents:* You must use the white ‘
![(-)](ck12_math_images_dir/f72fa146a2787d503b8991a6173a0ad9.png) ’ key
for negative exponents.
</dd>
</dl>
-   **Rounding:** Round your answers to a reasonable number of digits.
    If the answer from the calculator is 1.369872654389, but the numbers
    in the problem are like 21 m/s and 12s, you should round off to 1.4.
    To report the full number would be misleading (i.e. you are telling
    me you know something to very high accuracy, when in fact
    you don’t). Do not round your numbers while doing the calculation,
    otherwise you’ll probably be off a bit due to the dreaded ‘round
    off error’.
-   **Does your answer make sense:** Remember you are smarter than
    the calculator. Check your answer to make sure it is reasonable. For
    example, if you are finding the height of a cliff and your answer is
    0.00034 m. That can’t be right because the cliff is definitely
    higher than 0.34 mm. Another example, the speed of light is ![3
    \\times 10\^8 \\
    m/s](ck12_math_images_dir/c670208bc1632e3fd72fecc4ee576649.png) (i.e.
    light travels 300 million meters in one second). Nothing can go
    faster than the speed of light. If you calculate the speed of a car
    to be ![2.4 \\times 10\^{10} \\
    m/s](ck12_math_images_dir/d491853e7735e16e508700606aec4438.png) ,
    you know this is wrong and possibly a calculator typ-o.

**Key Applications**

The late, great physicist Enrico Fermi used to solve problems by making
educated guesses. For instance, say you want to *guess* timate the
number of cans of soda drank by everybody in San Francisco in one year.
You’ll come pretty close if you guess that there are about 800,000
people in S.F., and that each person drinks on average about 100 cans
per year. So, 80,000,000 cans are consumed every year. Sure, this answer
is wrong, but it is likely not off by more than a factor of 10 (i.e., an
“order of magnitude”). That is, even if we guess, we’re going to be in
the *ballpark* of the right answer. That is always the first step in
working out a physics problem.

**Units and Problem Solving Problem Set**

*‘Solving a problem is like telling a story.’* -Deb Jensen 2007

For the following problems and all the problems in this book, show the
equation you are using before plugging in the numbers, then show each
and every step as you work down line by line to get the answer. Equally
important, show the units canceling at each step.

*“I often think about music. I daydream about music. I see my life in
the form of music.”* - Albert Einstein

**The Big Idea**

The development of devices to measure time like a pendulum led to the
analysis of *periodic motion.* Motion that *repeats itself in equal
intervals of time* is called *harmonic motion.* When an object moves
back and forth over the *same path* in harmonic motion it is said to be
*oscillating.* If the amount of motion of an oscillating object (the
distance the object travels) stays the same during the period of motion,
it is called *simple* harmonic motion(SHM). A grandfather clock’s
pendulum and the quartz crystal in a modern watch are examples of SHM.

Objects in motion that return to the same position after a fixed period
of time are said to be in *harmonic motion.* Objects in harmonic motion
have the ability to transfer some of their energy over large distances.
They do so by creating waves in a medium. Imagine pushing up and down on
the surface of a bathtub filled with water. Water acts as the medium
that carries energy from your hand to the edges of the bathtub. Waves
transfer energy over a distance without direct contact of the initial
source. In this sense waves are phenomena not objects.

**Key Concepts**

-   The oscillating object does not lose any energy in SHM. Friction is
    assumed to be zero.
-   In harmonic motion there is always a *restorative force* , which
    acts in the opposite direction of the velocity. The restorative
    force changes during oscillation and depends on the position of
    the object. In a spring the force is the spring force; in a pendulum
    it is the component of gravity along the path. In both cases, the
    force on the oscillating object is directly opposite that of the
    direction of velocity.
-   Objects in simple harmonic motion do not obey the “Big Three”
    equations of motion because the acceleration is not constant. As a
    spring compresses, the force (and hence acceleration) increases. As
    a pendulum swings, the tangential component of the force of gravity
    changes, so the acceleration changes.
-   The **period** ,
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) , is
    the amount of time for the harmonic motion to repeat itself, or for
    the object to go one full cycle. In SHM,
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) is
    the time it takes the object to return to its exact starting point
    and starting direction.
-   The **frequency** ,
    ![f](ck12_math_images_dir/f4d93c204a4d248190d38dc78b13a931.png) , is
    the number of cycles an object goes through in 1 second. Frequency
    is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz = 1 cycle per sec.
-   The **amplitude** ,
    ![A](ck12_math_images_dir/d5ebd507fac84fdb3364e6593d198a76.png) , is
    the distance from the *equilibrium* (or center) *point* of motion to
    either its lowest or highest point ( *end points* ). The amplitude,
    therefore, is half of the total distance covered by the
    oscillating object. The amplitude can vary in harmonic motion but is
    constant in SHM.
-   A ***medium*** is the substance through which the wave travels. For
    example, water acts as the medium for ocean waves, while air
    molecules act as the medium for sound waves.
-   When a wave passes through a medium, the medium is only
    temporarily disturbed. When an ocean wave travels from one side of
    the Mediterranean Sea to the other, no actual water molecules move
    this great distance. Only the *disturbance* propagates (moves)
    through the medium.
-   An object oscillating with frequency
    ![f](ck12_math_images_dir/f4d93c204a4d248190d38dc78b13a931.png) will
    create waves which oscillate with the same frequency
    ![f](ck12_math_images_dir/f4d93c204a4d248190d38dc78b13a931.png) .
-   The **speed**
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png)
    **and wavelength**
    ![\\lambda](ck12_math_images_dir/8406407b3909f10f3790ce64c33cb08e.png)
    of a wave depend on the nature of the medium through which the
    wave travels.
-   There are two main types of waves we will consider: **longitudinal**
    and **transverse** waves.
-   In **longitudinal** waves, the vibrations of the medium are in the
    *same direction* as the wave motion. A classic example is a wave
    traveling down a line of standing dominoes: each domino will fall in
    the same direction as the motion of the wave. A more physical
    example is a sound wave. For sound waves, high and low pressure
    zones move both forward and backward as the wave moves through them.
-   In **transverse** waves, the vibrations of the medium are
    *perpendicular* to the direction of motion. A classic example is a
    wave created in a long rope: the wave travels from one end of the
    rope to the other, but the actual rope moves up and down, and not
    from left to right as the wave does.
-   Water waves act as a mix of longitudinal and transverse waves. A
    typical water molecule pretty much moves in a circle when a wave
    passes through it.
-   Most wave media act like a series of connected oscillators. For
    instance, a rope can be thought of as a large number of
    masses (molecules) connected by springs (intermolecular forces). The
    speed of a wave through connected harmonic oscillators depends on
    the distance between them, the spring constant, and the mass. In
    this way, we can model wave media using the principles of simple
    harmonic motion.
-   The speed of a wave on a string depends on the material the string
    is made of, as well as the tension in the string. This fact is why
    *tightening* a string on your violin or guitar will *increase* the
    frequency, or pitch, of the sound it produces.
-   The speed of a sound wave in air depends subtly on pressure,
    density, and temperature, but is about 343 m/s at room temperature.

    \\frac{1}{f}](ck12_math_images_dir/dc60aef34ecc06aca0c2ee52d98e8344.png)

    difference in their frequencies.

    withdepends on the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due
    to gravity.

**Key Applications**

-   *Constructive interference* occurs when two waves combine to create
    a larger wave. This occurs when the peaks of two waves line up.
-   *Destructive interference* occurs when two waves combine and cancel
    each other out. This occurs when a peak in one wave lines up with a
    trough in the other wave.
-   When waves of two different frequencies interfere, a phenomenon
    known as *beating* occurs. The frequency of a beat is the difference
    of the two frequencies.
-   When a wave meets a barrier, it reflects and travels back the way
    it came. The reflected wave may interfere with the original wave. If
    this occurs in precisely the right way, a *standing wave* can
    be created. The types of standing waves that can form depend
    strongly on the speed of the wave and the size of the region in
    which it is traveling.
-   A couple typical standing waves are shown below. The first is the
    motion of a simple jump-rope. *Nodes* are the places where the rope
    doesn’t move at all; *antinodes* occur where the motion is greatest.
    The second is a string in its

-   Longitudinal waves, like sound waves, have compression and
    rarefaction zones. The compression zones are where, for example in a
    sound wave traveling through air, the air molecules are
    densely packed. The rarefaction zones are areas where the air
    molecules are loosely packed, like a vacuum zone. Us teachers will
    often draw longitudinal waves as transverse waves, but remember
    the difference.

-   The *DopplerEffect* occurs when either the source of a wave or the
    observer of a wave (or both) are moving. When a source of a wave is
    moving towards you, the apparent frequency of the wave you detect is
    higher than that emitted. For instance, if a car approaches you
    while playing a note at 500 Hz, the sound you hear will be
    slightly higher. The opposite occurs (the frequency observed is
    lower than emitted) for a receding wave or if the observer moves
    away from the source. It’s important to note that the speed of the
    wave does not change –it’s traveling through the same medium so the
    speed is the same. Due to the relative motion between the source and
    the observer the frequency changes, but not the speed of the wave.
    Note that while the effect is similar for light and electromagnetic
    waves the formulas are not exactly the same as for sound.

**SHM, Wave Motion and Sound Problem Set**

*Be sure to show all your work in the space provided!*

1.  Take two classic examples of simple harmonic motion and answer the
    following questions.
    1.  Does the period of a pendulum depend upon the pendulum’s mass or
        length? If the pendulum is lengthened, what happens to its
        frequency of oscillation? What happens to its period?
    2.  Does the period of a mass on a spring depend upon the mass or
        length of the spring? If the spring is replaced with a ‘stiffer’
        spring (and thus a larger spring constant), what happens to its
        frequency of oscillation? What happens to its period?

2.  If you tap your toe into a calm swimming pool, circular
    waves result.
    1.  What does the fact that those waves are circular tell you about
        the speed of the wave in different directions?
    2.  If you tap your toe more frequently, what happens to the
        wavelength of those waves? What happens to the period of the
        waves?

3.  Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light. Which color has
    the higher frequency? Which moves faster in a vacuum?
4.  What changes about a wave in the Doppler effect: Frequency?
    Wavelength? Speed? Is it correct to say that if an ambulance is
    moving towards you the speed of the sound from its siren is faster
    than normal? Discuss.
5.  Astronomers can tell from looking at the spectrum of some galaxies
    that they’re moving – the light is “red-shifted”, meaning the
    wavelengths look longer than if the galaxies were at rest relative
    to us.
    1.  Are those galaxies moving towards us or away from us?
    2.  If an astronomer looked at the sun and saw light “red-shifted”
        on one side and “blue-shifted” on the other, what would that
        information tell them about the sun?

6.  A boat moving through the water does not always produce a bow wave,
    or wake. What has to be true about the boat’s speed to produce a bow
    wave?
7.  Describe the pressure changes in the air as a sound wave passes a
    given point, then explain why a very loud sound can damage your
    tympanic membrane (ear drum).
8.  If the frequency of a sound wave is tripled, what happens to its
    speed and wavelength? Explain briefly
    ![](ck12_2_files/20141227042416348888.png)
9.  The Indian instrument called a “sitar” uses two sets of strings, one
    above the other. Only one set of strings is played but both
    make sound. Research the sitar and explain briefly how this works.
    For more information about the Sitar, see
    [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/546792/sitar](sitar) .
10. “Noise-cancelling” headphones are useful for listening to music on
    noisy airplane flights – they cancel out the background sound on
    the plane. They’re also used by jackhammer operators to protect
    their ears. To be used properly the headphones briefly sample the
    background sound, then the “noise cancelling” comes on. Explain why
    this sampling is necessary and how the headphones work. Do a little
    research online if necessary to answer this question.
11. While treading water, you notice a buoy way out towards the horizon.
    The buoy is bobbing up and down in simple harmonic motion. You only
    see the buoy at the most upward part of its cycle. You see the buoy
    appear 10 times over the course of one minute.
    1.  What is the restoring force that is leading to simple harmonic
        motion?
    2.  What are the period
        ![(T)](ck12_math_images_dir/48fcbe7b8a2bf7e8f4e1893b82853bfd.png)
        and frequency
        ![(f)](ck12_math_images_dir/a35075bb949dd3309afc49dd38fa14a3.png)
        of its cycle? Use the proper units.

12. Bored in class, you start tapping your finger on the table. Your
    friend, sitting right next to you also starts tapping away. But
    while you are tapping once every second, you’re friend taps twice
    for every one tap of yours.
    1.  What is the Period and frequency of your tapping?
    2.  What is the Period and frequency of your friend’s tapping?
    3.  Your tapping starts small waves going down the desk. Sort of
        like hitting a bell with a hammer. The frequency of the sound
        you hear is 1200 Hz. You know the wave speed in wood is about
        3600 m/s. Find the wavelengths generated by your tapping.

13. Give some everyday examples of simple harmonic motion.
14. The pitch of a Middle C note on a piano is 263 Hz. This means when
    you hear this note, the hairs (cilia) in your inner ears wiggle back
    and forth at this frequency.
    1.  What is the period of oscillation for your ear hairs?
    2.  What is the period of oscillation of the struck wire within the
        piano?

15. You’re sitting on Ocean Beach in San Francisco one fine afternoon
    and you notice that the waves are crashing on the beach about 6
    times every minute.
    1.  Calculate the frequency and period of the waves.
    2.  You estimate that it takes 1 wave about 4 seconds to travel from
        a surfer 30 m off shore to the beach. Calculate the velocity and
        average wavelengths of the wave.

    kinks in its magnetic field. The number of visible spots varies over
    the course of years. Use the graph of the sunspot cycle below to
    answer the following questions. (Note that this is real data from

    </span> An earthquake can be thought of as a whole bunch of
    different waves all piled up on top of each other.
    1.  Estimate (using a ruler) the approximate period of oscillation
        ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png)
        of the minor aftershock which occurs around ![t =
        40](ck12_math_images_dir/36178d5a2ba7e46dc06b2bee7ee954b3.png) sec.
    2.  Convert your estimated period from part (a) into a frequency
        ![f](ck12_math_images_dir/f4d93c204a4d248190d38dc78b13a931.png)
        in Hz.
    3.  Suppose a wave with frequency
        ![f](ck12_math_images_dir/f4d93c204a4d248190d38dc78b13a931.png)
        from part (b) is traveling through concrete as a result of
        the earthquake. What is the wavelength
        ![\\lambda](ck12_math_images_dir/8406407b3909f10f3790ce64c33cb08e.png)
        of that wave in meters? (The speed of sound in concrete is
        approximately ![v = 3200 \\
        m/s](ck12_math_images_dir/1a7c590d5e4fb31dcec727bb67353816.png) .)

22. The speed of sound
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) in
    air is approximately ![331.4 \\ m/s + 0.6 \\
    T](ck12_math_images_dir/07f6dac25ff6e9d36d0c084eeb87df7f.png) ,
    where
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) is
    the temperature of the air in Celsius. The speed of light
    ![c](ck12_math_images_dir/ff94f53c1a04eac9031c58c091dedbc4.png) is
    300,000 km/sec, which means it travels from one place to another on
    Earth more or less instantaneously. Let’s say on a cool night (air
    temperature
    ![10\^\\circ](ck12_math_images_dir/1be11abb139f8044d100f44353fed37d.png) Celsius)
    you see lightning flash and then hear the thunder rumble five
    seconds later. How far away (in km) did the lightning strike?
23. Reread the difference between *transverse* and *longitudinal* waves.
    For each of the following types of waves, tell what type it is
    and why. (Include a sketch for each.)
    -   sound waves
    -   water waves in the wake of a boat
    -   a vibrating string on a guitar
    -   a swinging jump rope
    -   the vibrating surface of a drum
    -   the “wave” done by spectators at a sports event
    -   slowly moving traffic jams

24. For every vertical dashed line, add the two waves together and
    sketch the resultant wave on the third graph. Be as exact
    as possible. The two waves have different frequencies, but the same
    amplitude of 1 m. What is the frequency of the resultant wave? How
    will the resultant wave sound different? <span

    1.  What was the frequency of the shaking in Hz?
    2.  Why was the bridge oscillating so violently?
    3.  Calculate two other frequencies that would be considered
        “dangerous” for the bridge.
    4.  What could you do to make the bridge safer?

    1.  Draw a side-view of the western section of the Bay Bridge and
        identify the seven nodes in this section of the bridge.
    2.  Assume that the bridge is concrete (the speed of sound in
        concrete is 3200 m/s). What is the lowest frequency of vibration
        for the bridge? (You can assume that the towers are equally
        spaced, and that the central support is equidistant from both
        middle towers. The best way to approach this problem is by
        drawing in a wave that “works.”)
    3.  What might happen if an earthquake occurs that shakes the bridge
        at precisely this frequency?

27. Aborigines, the native people of Australia, play an instrument
    called the Didgeridoo like the one shown above. The Didgeridoo
    produces a low pitch sound and is possibly the world’s
    oldest instrument. The one shown above is about 1.3 m long and open
    at both ends.
    1.  Knowing that when a tube is open at both ends there must be an
        antinode at both ends, draw the first 3 harmonics for
        this instrument.
    2.  Calculate the frequency of the first 3 harmonics assuming room
        temperature and thus a velocity of sound of 340 m/s. Then take a
        shot at deriving a generic formula for the frequency of the
        ![n](ck12_math_images_dir/c73c4e5aa4eb7c39977bbf98a8cd212a.png)
        th standing wave mode for the Didgeridoo, as was done for the
        string tied at both ends and for the tube open at one end.

28. At the Sunday drum circle in Golden Gate Park, an Indian princess is
    striking her drum at a frequency of 2 Hz. You would like to hit your
    drum at another frequency, so that the sound of your drum and the
    sound of her drum “beat” together at a frequency of 0.1 Hz. What
    frequencies could you choose?
29. Students are doing an experiment to determine the speed of sound
    in air. They hold a tuning fork above a large empty graduated
    cylinder and try to create resonance. The air column in the
    graduated cylinder can be adjusted by putting water in it. At a
    certain point for each tuning fork a clear resonance point is heard.
    The students adjust the water finely to get the peak resonance then
    carefully measure the air column from water to top of air column.
    (The assumption is that the tuning fork itself creates an anti-node
    and the water creates a node.) The following data were collected:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Frequency of     **Length of air    **Wavelength (m)** **Speed of sound
  tuning fork (Hz)** column (cm)**                         (m/s)**

29. 1.  Fill out the last two columns in the data table.
    2.  Explain major inconsistencies in the data or results.
    3.  The graduated cylinder is 50 cm high. Were there other resonance
        points that could have been heard? If so what would be the
        length of the wavelength?
    4.  What are the inherent errors in this experiment?

30. A train, moving at some speed lower than the speed of sound, is
    equipped with a gun. The gun shoots a bullet forward at precisely
    the speed of sound, relative to the train. An observer watches some
    distance down the tracks, with the bullet headed towards him. Will
    the observer hear the sound of the bullet being fired before being
    struck by the bullet? Explain.
31. Peter is playing tones by blowing across the top of a glass bottle
    partially filled with water. He notices that if he blows softly he
    hears a lower note, but if he blows harder he hears higher
    frequencies. 
    1.  In the 120 cm long tubes below draw three diagrams showing the
        first three harmonics produced in the tube. Please draw the
        waves as transverse even though we know sound waves are
        longitudinal (reason for this, obviously, is that it is much
        easier to draw transverse waves rather than longitudinal). Note
        that the tube is CLOSED at one end and OPEN at the other. <span

    2.  Calculate the frequencies of the first three harmonics played in
        this tube, if the speed of sound in the tube is 340 m/s. 
    3.  The speed of sound in carbon dioxide is lower than in air. If
        the bottle contained CO ~2~  instead of air, would the
        frequencies found above be higher or lower? Knowing that the
        pitch of your voice gets higher when you inhale helium, what can
        we say about the speed of sound in He.

**PART I: Nature of Light, Polarization, Color**

**The Big Idea**

Light is a *wave* of changing electric and magnetic fields. Light waves
are caused by disturbances in the electromagnetic field that permeates
the universe, for example, the acceleration of charged particles (such
as electrons). Light has a dual nature: at times, it acts like waves; at
other times it acts like particles, called *photons* . Light travels
through space at the maximum speed allowed by the laws of physics,
called the speed of light. Light has no mass, but it carries energy and
momentum. Of all possible paths *light rays will always take the path
that takes the least amount of time* (not distance). This is known as
Fermat’s Principle.

Light, more generally known as Electromagnetic Waves (EM Waves), can be
produced in many different wavelengths that can be very large to
extremely small. EM waves can be polarized when produced or after going
through a filter (natural or man-made). Polarization of light, means
that the light wave oscillates in only one direction rather than
unpolarized light that oscillates in two directions as it moves forward.

The visible range of light (i.e. the range of wavelengths that our eyes
can detect) is a very narrow piece of the full EM spectrum. In the
visible range our eyes differentiate between the different wavelengths
by producing ‘color’ for them. When we observe something that is green,
it is green to us, because the wavelength of the light hitting our eyes
is around 550 nm. If the wavelength of light is slightly larger than
this it starts to look red, if it is slightly smaller it looks blue.
White light is the combination of all the colors. Black light is the
absence of EM waves in the visible spectrum for human beings.

**Key Concepts**

-   Light is produced when charged particles *accelerate* . As a result
    changing electric and magnetic fields radiate outward. The traveling
    electric and magnetic fields of an accelerating (often oscillating)
    charged particle are known as electromagnetic radiation or light.
-   The color of light that we observe is nothing more than the
    wavelength of the light: the *longer* the wavelength, the *redder*
    the light.
-   Light can have any wavelength at all. Our *vision* is restricted to
    a very narrow range of colors between red and violet.
-   The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly broken into
    the following ranges:

  ***Color***                                                                                ***Wavelength range***                                                                                           ***Comparison size***

-   The brightness, or **intensity** , of light is inversely
    proportional to the square of the distance between the light source
    and the observer. This is just one of many **inverse square laws**
    in physics; others include gravitational and electrical forces.
-   Fermat’s Principle makes the angle of incident light equal to the
    angle of reflected light. This is the *law of reflection* .
-   When light travels from one type of material (like air) into another
    (like glass), the speed changes due to interactions between photons
    and electrons. **Transparent** materials transmit the
    electromagnetic energy at a speed slower than
    ![c](ck12_math_images_dir/ff94f53c1a04eac9031c58c091dedbc4.png) ;
    **opaque** materials absorb that EM energy and convert it into heat.
    A material may be transparent to some wavelengths of light but
    opaque to others.
-   **Polarized** light is made of waves oscillating in only one
    direction: horizontal or vertical. The direction of the oscillation
    of the light waves is the same as the direction of oscillation of
    the electron *creating* the light. Unpolarized light can be
    polarized selectively by reflections from surfaces (glare); the
    orientation of the reflected light polarization is the same as that
    of the surface.
-   White light consists of a mixture of all the visible colors: red,
    orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROYGBIV). Our
    perception of the color black is tied to the *absence* of light.
-   Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive cells. The
    three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can have sensitivity
    in three colors: red, blue, and green. Our perception of other
    colors is made from the *relative amounts* of each color that the
    cones register from light reflected from the object we are
    looking at. Our brightness-sensitive cells (rods) work well in
    low light. This is why things look ‘black and white’ at night.
-   The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes – like those in a colorful
    shirt – absorb light at frequencies that correspond to
    certain colors. When you shine white light on these pigments and
    dyes, some colors are absorbed and some colors are reflected. We
    only see the colors that objects *reflect* .

**Key Applications**

-   *Rayleigh scattering* occurs when light interacts with
    our atmosphere. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more
    strongly it is disturbed by collisions with atmospheric molecules.
    So blue light from the Sun is preferentially *scattered* by these
    collisions into our line of sight. This is why the sky appears blue.
-   *Beautiful sunsets* occur when light travels long distances through
    the atmosphere. The blue light and some green is scattered away,
    leaving only red and a little green, making the sun appear red.

**Light Questions**

1.  Which travels faster - a radio wave or a sound wave? What’s the
    fundamental difference between the two? (bonus: name another
    fundamental difference between the two)
2.  Light does not travel infinitely fast – its speed in a vacuum is ![3
    \\times 10\^8 \\
    m/s](ck12_math_images_dir/c670208bc1632e3fd72fecc4ee576649.png) . We
    measure very large astronomical distances in “light years” (LY) –
    the distance light travels in one year. The closest star beyond our
    sun is Alpha Centauri, 4 LY away. Some distant quasars are 2 billion
    LY away. Why do astronomers say that to look at these distant
    objects is to look back in time? Explain briefly.
3.  When light impinges upon an object three things can happen to it:
    absorption, transmission, or reflection. Discuss an example of each.
4.  Which corresponds to light of longer wavelength, UV rays or IR rays?
5.  Which corresponds to light of lower frequency,
    ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    rays or millimeter-wavelength light?
6.  Approximately how many blue wavelengths would fit end-to-end within
    a space of one millimeter?
7.  Approximately how many short (“hard”)
    ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    rays would fit end-to-end within the space of a single red
    wavelength?
8.  Calculate the frequency in Hz of a typical green photon emitted by
    the Sun. What is the physical interpretation of this (very high)
    frequency? (That is, what is oscillating)?
9.  FM radio stations list the frequency of the light they are emitting
    in MHz, or millions of cycles per second. For instance, 90.3 FM
    would operate at a frequency of ![90.3 \\times 10\^6 \\
    Hz](ck12_math_images_dir/bb92bc3c0b9f653d9a2789aea82cb59d.png) .
    What is the wavelength of the radio-frequency light emitted by this
    radio station? Compare this length to the size of your car’s
    antenna, and make an argument as to why the length of a car’s
    antenna should be about the wavelength of the light you
    are receiving.
10. Our sun is 8 “light minutes” from earth.
    1.  Using the speed of light as

    2.  The nearest galaxy to our Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy, 2
        million light years away. How far away is the Andromeda Galaxy
        in miles?

    1.  Your coat looks magenta in white light. What color does it
        appear in blue light? In green light?
    2.  Which secondary color would look black under a blue light bulb?
    3.  You look at a cyan-colored ribbon under white light. Which of
        the three primary colors is your eye *not* detecting?

12. The **primary** colors of light are red, green, and blue. This is
    due to the way our eyes see color and the chemical reactions in the
    cone cells of the retina. Mixing these colors will produce the
    **secondary** , or complementary colors: magenta, cyan and yellow,
    as well as white. On the diagram below label colors to show how this
    works: <span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->

13. Color printers use a different method of color mixing: color mixing
    by **subtraction** . What colors are used in this process? (HINT:
    look at the ink colors in an ink-jet printer, CYMB). The idea here
    is that each color **subtracts** from the reflected light – for
    example, cyan ink reflects blue and green but SUBTRACTS red. If
    Explain with diagrams how CYM can be combined to produce red, blue,
    and green.

    (The earth-sun distance is defined as 1 AU, or *astronomical
    unit* ).
    1.  What fraction of sunlight intensity hits your solar panel at
        Neptune compared with at Earth?
    2.  Design a solar panel (size) that would allow you to collect the
        same amount of solar power (same amount of light energy in
        same time) on Neptune as on Earth.

22. You are reading two feet from a lamp with a 100 W (100 Watts)
    light bulb. For this problem, assume that a 100 W bulb is exactly

**PART II: Reflection, Refraction, Mirrors and Lenses**

**The Big Idea**

Fermat’s Principle states that *light will always take the path of least
amount of time* (not distance). This principle governs the paths light
will take and explains the familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction,
lenses and diffraction. Light rarely travels in a straight-line path.
When photons interact with electrons in matter the time it takes for
this interaction determines the path. For example, higher frequency blue
light is refracted more than red because blue wavelengths interacts more
frequently with electrons than red wavelengths and the path of least
time is for blue to bend more then red in order to get out of this
‘slow’ area faster. The rainbows we see are a result of this. Fermat’s
Principle explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from rainbows
to sunsets to the haloes around the moon.

**Key Concepts**

-   Fermat’s Principle makes the angle of incident light equal to the
    angle of reflected light. This is the *law of reflection* .
-   When light travels from one type of material (like air) into another
    (like glass), the speed slows down due to interactions between
    photons and electrons. If the ray enters the material at an angle
    Fermat’s Principle dictates that the light also changes the
    direction of its motion. This is called *refraction* . See the
    figure shown to the right, which demonstrates the refraction a light
    ray experiences as it passes from air into a rectangular piece of
    glass and out again. Because light travels at slower than usual
    speed in transparent materials (due to constantly being absorbed and
    re-emitted), the light ray bends in order to get out of this
    material quicker and satisfy Fermat’s Principle. Note that this
    means that light doesn’t always travel in a straight line.

</span>

-   When light is refracted its *wavelength* and *speed* change;
    however, its frequency remains the same as the frequency of the
    light source. Proof of this is that light retains its original color
    under water. For example, blue light is still blue under water.

**Key Applications**

-   *Total internal reflection* occurs when light goes from a slow (high
    index of refraction) medium to a fast (low index of refraction)
    medium. With total internal reflection, light refracts *so* much it
    actually refracts back into the first medium. This is how fiber
    optic cables work: no light leaves the wire.

</span>

-   *Lenses* , made from curved pieces of glass, focus or de-focus light
    as it passes through. Lenses that focus light are called
    *converging* lenses, and these are the ones used to make telescopes
    and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light are called
    *diverging* lenses.
-   Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called *images* .
-   *Mirrors* are made from highly reflective metal that is applied to a
    curved or flat piece of glass. Converging mirrors can be used to
    focus light – headlights, telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and
    solar cookers all rely on this principle. Like lenses, mirrors can
    create images.
-   The *focal length* ,
    ![f](ck12_math_images_dir/f4d93c204a4d248190d38dc78b13a931.png) , of
    a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the lens or
    mirror to the place where the light is focused. This is called the
    *focal point* or *focus* . For diverging lenses or mirrors, the
    focal length is negative.
-   When light rays converge in front of a mirror or behind a lens, a
    *real* image is formed. Real images are useful in that you can place
    photographic film at the physical location of the real image, expose
    the film to the light, and make a two-dimensional representation of
    the world, a photograph.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_4_files/20141227042545856099.jpeg)
</span>

-   When light rays diverge in front of a mirror or behind a lens, a
    *virtual* image is formed. A virtual image is a trick, like the
    person you see “behind” a mirror’s surface when you brush
    your teeth. Since virtual images aren’t actually “anywhere,” you
    can’t place photographic film anywhere to capture them.
-   Real images are upside-down, or *inverted* . You can make a real
    image of an object by putting it farther from a mirror or lens than
    the focal length. Virtual images are typically right-side-up. You
    can make virtual images by moving the mirror or lens closer to the
    object than the focal length.
-   When using the lens makers equation, remember that real things get
    positive numbers and virtual things get negative numbers. Thus,
    diverging lenses and virtual images get negative numbers. The object
    distance is always positive.

    This number is positive for real images (formed to the right of the
    lens), and negative for virtual images (formed to the left of
    the lens).

For mirrors, the same equation holds! However, the object and image
distances are both positive for real images formed to the left of the
mirror. For virtual images formed to the right of the mirror, the image
distance is negative.

**Light Problem Set**

1.  What’s the difference between **diffuse** reflection and
    **specular** reflection? The size of the irregularities on the
    surface of a material will affect how the light reflects. Do a
    little research online and diagram light reflecting from a) a rough
    asphalt road and b) the same road made smooth by filling in the
    bumps with water. Explain why this makes it difficult to drive at
    night in the rain.
2.  If you’re standing on the side of a lake spearfishing, do you aim
    **right at** the fish you’re trying to hit, **above** it, or
    **below** it? Explain and include a diagram. If you’re hitting the
    fish with a <span class="x-ck12-underline"> laser </span> instead
    where would you aim?
3.  Consider the following table, which states the indices of refraction
    for a number of materials.

  ***Material***      ![n](ck12_math_images_dir/c73c4e5aa4eb7c39977bbf98a8cd212a.png)

  water               1.33
  typical glass       1.52
  cooking oil         1.53
  heavy flint glass   1.65
  sapphire            1.77
  diamond             2.42

1.  For which of these materials is the speed of light *slowest* ?
2.  <span> Which two materials have the most similar indices of
    refraction? </span>
3.  <span> What is the speed of light in cooking oil? </span>

4.  A certain light wave has a frequency of ![4.29 \\times 10\^{14} \\
    Hz](ck12_math_images_dir/dae534f51926e9fbe212a43b17646d53.png) .
    What is the wavelength of this wave in empty space? In water?
5.  A light ray bounces off a fish in your aquarium. It travels through
    the water, into the glass side of the aquarium, and then into air.
    Draw a sketch of the situation, being careful to indicate how the
    light will change directions when it refracts at each interface.
    Include a brief discussion of why this occurs.
6.  In the “disappearing test tube” demo, a test tube filled with
    vegetable oil vanishes when placed in a beaker full of the same oil.
    How is this possible? Would a diamond tube filled with water and
    placed in water have the same effect?
7.  Imagine a thread of diamond wire immersed in water. Can such an
    object demonstrate total internal reflection? Draw a picture along
    with your calculations.
8.  Explain with a diagram how an **optical fiber** works. Do a little
    online research – what are optical fibers used for?
9.  Explain (include a diagram) how **dispersion** and **total internal
    reflection** combine to create the sparkly colors seen in a diamond.
    What’s the importance of the high index of refraction of diamond to
    this effect? <span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->

10. The figure above is immersed in water. Draw the light ray as it
    enters the Gas medium through its exit back into the water medium at
    the bottom. Be very careful drawing your light rays, making sure
    that it is clear when (and by how much) the angle is increasing,
    when decreasing and when staying the same. You may want to calculate
    the refracted angles to check your light ray drawings.
11. Use your ruler to draw the path of the ray as it goes through the
    following stack of materials. At each boundary draw the normal line.

13. Does the size of your image in a mirror **as seen by you** depend
    upon your distance from the mirror? Put another way, do you need a
    bigger mirror to see your entire face if you’re close to the mirror,
    but smaller if you’re far away? Try this after you shower: rub out a
    section of your bathroom mirror just large enough to contain
    your face. Then move closer, then farther away. What happens?
    Discuss briefly.
14. Marjan is looking at herself in a mirror (a normal flat mirror).
    Assume that her eyes are 10 cm below the top of her head, and that
    she stands 180 cm tall. Calculate the minimum length flat mirror
    that Marjan would need to see her body from eye level all the way
    down to her feet. Sketch at least 3 ray traces from her eyes showing
    the topmost, bottommost, and middle rays. *In the following six
    problems, you will do a careful ray tracing with a ruler (including
    the extrapolation of rays for virtual images). It is best if you can
    use different colors for the three different ray tracings. When
    sketching diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the
    extrapolated lines behind a mirror or in front of a lens in order to
    produce the virtual image. When comparing measured distances and
    heights to calculated distances and heights, values within 10% are
    considered “good.” Use the following cheat sheet as your guide.*
    CONVERGING (CONCAVE) MIRRORS Ray \#1: Leaves tip of candle, travels
    parallel to optic axis, reflects back through focus. Ray \#2: Leaves
    tip, travels through focus, reflects back parallel to optic axis.
    Ray \#3: Leaves tip, reflects off center of mirror with an angle of
    reflection equal to the angle of incidence. DIVERGING (CONVEX)
    MIRRORS Ray \#1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis,
    reflects OUTWARD by lining up with focus on the OPPOSITE side as
    the candle. Ray \#2: Leaves tip, heads toward the focus on the
    OPPOSITE side, and emerges parallel to the optic axis. Ray \#3:
    Leaves tip, heads straight for the mirror center, and reflects at an
    equal angle. CONVERGING (CONVEX) LENSES Ray \#1: Leaves tip, travels
    parallel to optic axis, refracts and travels to through to focus.
    Ray \#2: Leaves tip, travels through focus on same side, travels
    through lens, and exits lens parallel to optic axis on
    opposite side. Ray \#3: Leaves tip, passes straight through center
    of lens and exits without bending. DIVERGING (CONCAVE) LENSES Ray
    \#1: Leaves tip, travels parallel to optic axis, refracts OUTWARD by
    lining up with focus on the SAME side as the candle. Ray \#2: Leaves
    tip, heads toward the focus on the OPPOSITE side, and emerges
    parallel from the lens. Ray \#3: Leaves tip, passes straight through
    the center of lens and exits without bending.

**The Big Idea**

Speed represents how quickly an object is moving through space. Velocity
is speed with a direction, making it a *vector* quantity. If an object’s
velocity changes with time, the object is said to be accelerating. As
we’ll see in the next chapters, understanding the acceleration of an
object is the key to understanding its motion. We will assume constant
acceleration throughout this chapter.

    ; a combination of previous two equations.

**Key Concepts**

-   When you begin a problem, define a coordinate system. For positions,
    this is like a number line; for example, positive
    ![(+x)](ck12_math_images_dir/7757f2f09f6a6942b2766f66fe8165fe.png)
    positions can be to the right of the origin and negative
    ![(-x)](ck12_math_images_dir/cf6a54a0b17280454863398f76adf5dc.png)
    positions to the left of the origin.
-   For velocity
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) you
    might define positive as *moving to the right* and negative as
    *moving to the left* . What would it mean to have a **positive
    position** and a **negative velocity?**
-   For acceleration
    ![a](ck12_math_images_dir/cda95f8631fca76c7bb2c023f8dc1779.png) ,
    you might define positive as caused by a *force to the right* and
    negative as *a force to the left* . What would it mean to have a
    **negative velocity** and a **positive acceleration?** Careful,
    positive acceleration does not always mean increasing speed!
-   Be sure you understand the difference between average velocity
    (measured over a long period of time) and instantaneous velocity
    (measured at a single moment in time).
-   Gravity near the Earth pulls an object downwards toward the surface
    of the Earth with an acceleration of ![9.8 \\ m/s\^2 ( \\approx 10
    \\ m/s\^2)](ck12_math_images_dir/dd41ef8243dbb4727bdf7672f4111020.png) .
    In the absence of air resistance, all objects will fall with the
    same acceleration.
-   *Deceleration* is the term used when an object’s *speed* is
    decreasing due to acceleration in the opposite direction of
    its velocity.
-   If there is constant acceleration the graph
    ![x](ck12_math_images_dir/0f14991bebd0bc5ca2e82990e029d525.png) vs.
    ![t](ck12_math_images_dir/9d3c5065100d4aed2444b157fe99d3c1.png)
    produces a parabola. The slope of the graph equals the
    instantaneous velocity. The slope of a
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) vs.
    ![t](ck12_math_images_dir/9d3c5065100d4aed2444b157fe99d3c1.png)
    graph equals the acceleration.
-   The **slope** of the graph
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) vs.
    ![t](ck12_math_images_dir/9d3c5065100d4aed2444b157fe99d3c1.png) can
    be used to find **acceleration;** the **area** of the graph
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) vs.
    ![t](ck12_math_images_dir/9d3c5065100d4aed2444b157fe99d3c1.png) can
    be used to find **displacement.** Welcome to calculus!
-   At first, you might get frustrated trying to figure out which of the
    Big Three equations to use for a certain problem, but don’t worry,
    this comes with practice. Making a table that identifies the
    variables given in the problem and the variables you are looking for
    can sometimes help.

**The Big Idea**

In this chapter, we aim to understand and explain the parabolic motion
of a thrown object, known as projectile motion. Motion in one direction
is unrelated to motion in other perpendicular directions. Once the
object has been thrown, the only acceleration is in the
![y](ck12_math_images_dir/b4a681cb4394e7a28b5b01d49cf52c9e.png)
(up/down) direction. The
![x](ck12_math_images_dir/0f14991bebd0bc5ca2e82990e029d525.png)
(right/left) direction velocity remains unchanged.

**Key Equations**

*In the vertical direction*

-   ![\\Delta y = v\_{iy} t - \\frac{1}{2}
    gt\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/0bdf333b1f0e817e6639d7e5cbab7fe6.png)
-   ![\\Delta v\_y = -
    gt](ck12_math_images_dir/4e9af9d44d62ef268d2a748f0a91eb31.png)
-   ![v\_{y}{\^2} = v\_{iy}{\^2} -
    2g(\\Delta y)](ck12_math_images_dir/59dfe155626a383e25f4f21f07f40a94.png)
-   ![a\_y = -g = -9.806 \\ m/s\^2 \\approx -10 \\
    m/s\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/2759c11a1c7a08a464354b25e83f0231.png)

*In the horizontal direction*

-   ![\\Delta x =
    v\_{ix}t](ck12_math_images_dir/c10e480887ab0d9ba4bdda2dd377c3a3.png)
-   ![v\_x =
    v\_{ix}](ck12_math_images_dir/bf7bcc0e128b6a0e4f029d28bffee106.png)
    (does not change)
-   ![a\_x =
    0](ck12_math_images_dir/aaf898eee6f5b85ac4e4e18cd017f6cc.png)

*A few comments on the above equations:*

-   Recall: The ‘
    ![\\Delta](ck12_math_images_dir/9c0fc1e5543a69c912906692fece4ee1.png)
    ’ symbol means ‘change in’ so that for example ![\\Delta v\_y =
    v\_{fy} -
    v\_{iy}](ck12_math_images_dir/a60029e97bc125306ea42082dda52abf.png)
    , which tells you the change in the velocity from the starting
    velocity to the final velocity.
-   ![+y](ck12_math_images_dir/2aca67766c97bbf2e98572df0e206b2b.png)
    direction is defined as upward for the above equations
-   The initial velocity
    ![v\_i](ck12_math_images_dir/ac25e94540ff3f22f4e3ec24d716c9e4.png)
    can be separated into ![v\_{ix} = v\_i \\cos
    \\theta](ck12_math_images_dir/d920a51228b4e50bad1138767e6e5c2f.png)
    and ![v\_{iy} = v\_i \\sin
    \\theta](ck12_math_images_dir/02eee9f4855e0770baac8c5b57c81b3c.png)
    , where
    ![\\theta](ck12_math_images_dir/c5a34262010219deb3af5d2a5c54cd89.png)
    is the angle between the velocity vector and the horizontal.

**Key Concepts**

-   In projectile motion, the horizontal displacement of an object is
    called its *range* .
-   At the top of its flight, the vertical speed of an object is zero.
-   To work these problems, use the equations above: one set for the
    ![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
    direction (vertical direction), and one set for the
    ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    direction (horizontal direction). The
    ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    direction and
    ![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
    direction don’t “talk” to each other. They are separate dimensions.
    Keep them separate.
-   The time is the same for the two directions, and can be plugged into
    both equations.
-   Since in the absence of air resistance, there is no acceleration in
    the ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    direction, the velocity in the
    ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    direction does not change over time. This is a counter-intuitive
    notion for many. (Air resistance will cause the
    ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
    velocity to decrease slightly or significantly depending on
    the object. But this factor is ignored for the time being.)
-   The ![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
    direction motion must include the acceleration due to gravity, and
    therefore the velocity in the
    ![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
    direction changes over time.
-   The shape of the path of an object undergoing projectile motion is
    a parabola.
-   We will ignore air resistance in this chapter. Air resistance will
    tend to shorten the range of the projectile motion by virtue of
    producing an acceleration opposite to the direction of motion.

**Two-Dimensional and Projectile Motion Problem Set**

*Draw detailed pictures for each problem (putting in all the data, such
as initial velocity, time, etc.), and write down your questions when you
get stuck.*

1.  Determine which of the following is in projectile motion. Remember
    that “projectile motion” means that gravity is the only means of
    acceleration for the object after launch.
    1.  A jet airplane during takeoff
    2.  A baseball during a Barry Bonds home run
    3.  A spacecraft just after all the rockets turn off in Earth orbit
    4.  A basketball thrown towards a basket
    5.  A bullet shot out of a gun
    6.  An inter-continental ballistic missile
    7.  A package dropped out of an airplane as it ascends upward with
        constant speed

2.  Decide if each of the statements below is True or False. Then,
    explain your reasoning.
    1.  At a projectile’s highest point, its velocity is zero.
    2.  At a projectile’s highest point, its acceleration is zero.
    3.  The rate of change of the
        ![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
        position is changing with time along the projectile path.
    4.  The rate of change of the
        ![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
        position is changing with time along the projectile path.
    5.  Suppose that after 2 s, an object has traveled 2 m in the
        horizontal direction. If the object is in projectile motion, it
        must travel 2 m in the vertical direction as well.
    6.  Suppose a hunter fires his gun. Suppose as well that as the
        bullet flies out horizontally and undergoes projectile motion,
        the shell for the bullet falls directly downward. Then, the
        shell hits the ground before the bullet.

3.  Imagine the path of a soccer ball in projectile motion. Which of the
    following is true at the highest point in its flight?
    1.  ![v\_x = 0, v\_y = 0, a\_x =
        0,](ck12_math_images_dir/6e932fc2329be1ed9ae7754f45768b5f.png)

        and ![a\_y = - 9.8 \\

4.  A hunter with an air blaster gun is preparing to shoot at a monkey
    hanging from a tree. He is pointing his gun directly at the monkey.
    The monkey’s got to think quickly! What is the monkey’s best chance
    to avoid being smacked by the rubber ball?
    1.  The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will pass
        beneath him due to gravity.
    2.  The monkey should let go when the hunter fires. Since the gun is
        pointing right at him, he can avoid getting hit by falling to
        the ground.
    3.  The monkey should stay right where he is: the bullet will sail
        above him since its vertical velocity increases by 9.8 m/s every
        second of flight.
    4.  The monkey should let go when the hunter fires. He will fall
        faster than the bullet due to his greater mass, and it will fly
        over his head.

5.  You are riding your bike in a straight line with a speed of 10 m/s.
    You accidentally drop your calculator out of your backpack from a
    height of 2.0 m above the ground. When it hits the ground, where is
    the calculator in relation to the position of your backpack?
    1.  You and your backpack are 6.3 m ahead of the calculator.
    2.  You and your backpack are directly above the calculator.
    3.  You and your backpack are 6.3 m behind the calculator.
    4.  None of the above.

6.  A ball of mass
    ![m](ck12_math_images_dir/de65f173073697541b369ca6047387a8.png) is
    moving horizontally with speed

**The Big Idea**

Acceleration is caused by force. The more force applied, the greater the
acceleration that is produced. Objects with high masses have more
inertia and thus resist more strongly changes to its current velocity.
In the absence of applied forces, objects simply keep moving at whatever
speed they are already going. All forces come in pairs because they
arise in the interaction of two objects — you can’t hit without being
hit back! In formal language
![\^1](ck12_math_images_dir/0580ae834d720d2b8be690119ed5b579.png) :

*Newton’s
![1\^{st}](ck12_math_images_dir/c6103ca16f5058147b115ab9b1355b9e.png)
Law: Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in
a right* (straight) *line, unless it is compelled to change that state
by forces impressed upon it.*

*Newton’s
![2\^{nd}](ck12_math_images_dir/15ea61e189cc83500c585e6fcaacf5a5.png)
Law: The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed;
and is made in the direction of the right* (straight) *line in which
that force is impressed.*

*Newton’s
![3\^{rd}](ck12_math_images_dir/4b687b6fa9204a985b6fa0e94aff861f.png)
Law: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the
mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and
directed to contrary parts.*

![\^1](ck12_math_images_dir/0580ae834d720d2b8be690119ed5b579.png)
Principia in modern English, Isaac Newton, University of California
Press, 1934

**Key Concepts**

-   An object will not change its state of motion (i.e., accelerate)
    unless an unbalanced force acts on it. Equal and oppositely directed
    forces do not produce acceleration.
-   If no unbalanced force acts on an object the object remains at
    constant velocity or at rest.
-   The force of gravity is called weight and equals m **g** , where
    ![g](ck12_math_images_dir/445b8ec61d85010de66aebf640d2eb84.png) is
    the acceleration due to gravity of the planet ( ![g = 9.8 \\ m/s\^2
    \\sim 10 \\
    m/s\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/81073561d28988ac24e8ec6492b34d99.png) ,
    downward, on Earth).
-   Your mass does not change when you move to other planets, because
    mass is a measure of how much *matter* your body contains, and not
    how much gravitational force you feel.
-   Newton’s
    ![3\^{rd}](ck12_math_images_dir/4b687b6fa9204a985b6fa0e94aff861f.png)
    Law states for every force there is an equal but opposite
    reaction force. To distinguish a third law pair from merely
    oppositely directed pairs is difficult but very important. Third law
    pairs must obey three rules: they must be of the same type of force,
    they are exerted on two different objects and they are equal in
    magnitude and oppositely directed. *Example:* A block sits on
    a table. The Earth’s gravity on the block and the force of the table
    on the block are equal and opposite. **But these are not third law
    pairs,** because they are both on the same object and the forces are
    of different types. The proper third law pairs are: (1) earth’s
    gravity on block/block’s gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on
    block/ block pushes on table.
-   **Pressure** is often confused with force. Pressure is force spread
    out over an area; a small force exerted on a very small area can
    create a very large pressure; i.e., poke a pin into your arm!
-   The force of **friction** can actually be described in terms of the
    *coefficient of friction,*
    ![\\mu](ck12_math_images_dir/dd23615e9fd9301b4a107825d92bc318.png) .
    It is determined experimentally and varies depending upon the two
    surfaces in contact.
-   **Static friction** acts between two surfaces that are in contact
    but not in motion with respect to each other. This force prevents
    objects from sliding. It always opposes potential motion, and it
    rises in magnitude to a maximum value given by the formula below.
    ![\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/83569b3ade07eb578cea31154385c541.png)
-   **Kinetic friction** acts between two surfaces that are in contact
    and in motion with respect to each other. This force reduces the
    acceleration and it always opposes the direction of motion.
    ![\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/83569b3ade07eb578cea31154385c541.png)

![\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/83569b3ade07eb578cea31154385c541.png)
Ultimately many of these “contact” forces are due to attractive and
repulsive electromagnetic forces between atoms in materials.

**Problem Solving for Newton’s Laws, Step-By-Step**

1\. *Figure out which object is “of interest.”*

If you're looking for the motion of a rolling cart, the cart is the
object of interest. Draw a sketch! This may help you sort out which
object is which in your problem.

2\. *Using your object as the “origin”, draw an
![x-y](ck12_math_images_dir/207515e3b2ea8422047a88d49f01b7d2.png)
coordinate system on your sketch.*

This will help you properly place the directions of all your forces.
Label to the right the
![+x](ck12_math_images_dir/ded5a4d8ae585bda875e454ef5fce93d.png)
direction and up as the
![+y](ck12_math_images_dir/2aca67766c97bbf2e98572df0e206b2b.png)
direction. Label the mass.

3\. *Identify all the forces acting on the object and draw them. This is
called a free body diagram (FBD).* ***LABEL*** *all forces – not with
numbers, but with the symbol representing the force; i.e.
![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) is
tension, mg is weight,
![N](ck12_math_images_dir/cbbeff3f966a4aff4cf989490f2fdba8.png) is
normal, etc. Be careful - If you can’t identify a force it may not
really exist!* INERTIA IS NOT A FORCE!

a\. If the object has mass and is near the Earth, the easiest (and
therefore first) force to write down is the force of gravity, pointing
downward, with value *mg* .

b\. If the object is in contact with a surface, it means there is a
normal force acting on the object. This normal force points *away* from
and is perpendicular to the surface.

c\. There may be more than one normal force acting on an object. For
instance, if you have a bologna sandwich, remember that the slice of
bologna feels normal forces from both the slices of bread!

d\. If a rope, wire, or cord is pulling on the object in question, you've
found yourself a tension force. The direction of this force is in the
same direction that the rope is pulling (you can’t push on a rope!).
Don’t worry about what’s on the OTHER end of the rope – it’s just
“tension”.

e\. Remember that Newton's 3rd Law, calling for “equal and opposite
forces,” does not apply to a single object. Only include forces acting
on the ONE object you have identified.

f\. Recall that scales (like a bathroom scale you weigh yourself on) read
out the normal force acting on you, not your weight. If you are at rest
on the scale, the normal force equals your weight. If you are
accelerating up or down, the normal force had better be higher or lower
than your weight, or you won’t have an unbalanced force to accelerate
you.

g\. Never include “m **a** ” as a force acting on an object. “m **a** ”
is the *result* for which the net force
![F\_{net}](ck12_math_images_dir/0ad7d301210e3ee537019814fb633aca.png)
is the *cause.*

4\. *Identify which forces are in the
![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
direction, which are in the
![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
direction, and which are at an angle.*

a\. If a force is upward, make it in the
![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
direction and give it a positive sign. If it is downward, make it in the
![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
direction and give it a negative sign.

b\. Same thing applies for right vs. left in the
![x-](ck12_math_images_dir/1da50ca9658d8f1200bb6c5c2f8b47e8.png)
direction. Make rightward forces positive.

5\. *“Fill in” to Newton’s second law:*

![& \\quad \\qquad \\ \\sum F\_{\\text{individual forces}}\\qquad \\ =
ma. \\\\& \\qquad \\text{or} \\ \\ \\sum F\_{x-\\text{direction
forces}}\\quad \\ \\ = ma\_x \\\\& \\qquad \\qquad \\nearrow \\qquad
\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\ \\nwarrow \\\\& Add \\ forces \\ from
\\ diagram \\qquad always \\ ma \\ on \\ right \\
side!](ck12_math_images_dir/b3c1dbf632eb201e53dfc5692aca1c85.png)

a\. Remember that all the rightward forces add with a plus (+) sign, and
that all the leftward forces add with a minus (–) sign.

b\. Now repeat, but for the
![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
*forces* and this will be equal to the mass multiplied by the
acceleration in the
![y-](ck12_math_images_dir/4852d8d93e0137067a1adc832a5bd1f6.png)
direction.

**Newton’s Laws Problem Set**

1.  Is there a net force on a hammer when you hold it steady above the
    ground? If you let the hammer drop, what’s the net force on the
    hammer while it is falling to the ground?
2.  If an object is moving at constant velocity or at rest, what is the
    minimum number of forces acting on it (other than zero)?
3.  If an object is accelerating, what is the minimum number of forces
    acting on it?
4.  You are standing on a bathroom scale. Can you reduce your weight by
    pulling up on your shoes? (Try it.) Explain.
5.  When pulling a paper towel from a paper towel roll, why is a quick
    jerk more effective than a slow pull?
6.  If you hang from the monkey bars with your arms completely vertical,
    what’s the force in each of your arms compared to your weight? Does
    that force increase, decrease, or remain constant if you reach over
    several bars with one arm, thus increasing the angle between your
    arms? Is it possible to hand with your arms <span
    class="x-ck12-underline"> completely </span> horizontal? Why not?
    Explain in terms of force components; draw FBDs to support
    your argument.
7.  You’re riding in a train moving at a constant velocity and you flip
    a coin. When it hits the floor, where does it land compared to where
    you dropped it? If instead the coin lands a meter away, what will
    you assume about the motion of the train? Explain using Newton’s law
    of inertia.
8.  When hit from behind in a car crash, a passenger can suffer a neck
    injury called <span class="x-ck12-underline"> whiplash </span> .
    Explain in terms of inertia how this occurs, and how headrests can
    prevent the injury.
9.  A cheetah can outrun a gazelle in a short straight race, but the
    gazelle can escape with its life by zigzagging. The cheetah is more
    massive than the gazelle – explain how this strategy works.
10. If your hammer develops a loose head, you can tighten it by banging
    it on the ground. A little physics secret though – it’s better to
    bang the hammer *head up* rather than *head down* . Explain,
    using inertia.
11. A car moves down the road with a constant positive velocity. A
    negative force is applied. Explain how this could occur, and what
    happens to the speed of the car as a result.

37. A stunt driver is approaching a cliff at very high speed. Sensors in

    on a horizontal road for ten seconds. Sensors show that there is a
    force in the direction of motion of 6000 N, but additional forces
    acting in the opposite direction with magnitude 1000 N. The mass of
    the car is 1250 kg. Step 2: Approaching the cliff, the driver takes
    his foot of the gas pedal (There is no further force in the
    direction of motion.) and brakes, increasing the force opposing
    motion from 1000 N to 2500 N. This continues for five seconds until
    he reaches the cliff. Step 3: The driver flies off the cliff, which
    is 44.1 m high, and begins projectile motion.

**The Big Idea**

The universe has many remarkable qualities, among them a rather
beautiful symmetry: the total amount of motion in the universe balances
out … always. This law only makes sense if we measure “motion” in a
specific way: as the product of mass and velocity. This product, called
*momentum* , can be exchanged from one object to another in a collision.
The rapidity with which momentum is exchanged over time is determined by
the forces involved in the collision. Conservation of momentum is one of
the five fundamental conservation laws in the universe. The other four
are conservation of energy, angular momentum, charge conservation and
CPT conservation.

**Key Equations**

-   ![p =
    mv](ck12_math_images_dir/550478d6b4c8afd5a3bf1b0b78dcc264.png) -
    Momentum equals mass multiplied by velocity. It is a vector,
    direction must be considered. Always define a positive direction and
    be consistent.
-   ![ \\Delta p = p\_f - p\_i
    ](ck12_math_images_dir/eb7776cc6028f60f04857d24b9a4d2de.png) -
    Impulse is defined as the difference between the final momentum and

the initial momentum of an object. When calculating impulse, consider
the change in momentum of one of the objects in the collision.

-   ![F = \\frac{\\triangle p}{\\triangle
    t}](ck12_math_images_dir/acf63a08385edf393b1472f56eed0d08.png) -
    Note that ![\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{m \\Delta
    v}{\\Delta t} =
    ma](ck12_math_images_dir/f31fe011ebdaafd3c0accfff881c19ba.png) .
    This is just Newton’s
    ![2\^{nd}](ck12_math_images_dir/15ea61e189cc83500c585e6fcaacf5a5.png)
    Law!
-   ![\\sum p\_i = \\sum
    p\_f](ck12_math_images_dir/65f75b660987bece0ac1a8162a70bca6.png) -
    The sum of all the momenta before a collision equals the sum of all
    the momenta after the collision. When adding up momenta, be sure to
    add them as vectors, so include the positives and negatives and if a
    two dimensional collision, break into the x and y components. Also
    be sure to include all the objects in the system.

**Key Concepts**

-   Momentum is a vector that points in the direction of the
    velocity vector. The magnitude of this vector is the product of mass
    and speed.
-   The total momentum of the universe is always the same and is equal
    to zero. The total momentum of an isolated system never changes.
-   Momentum can be transferred from one body to another. In an isolated
    system in which momentum is transferred internally, the total
    initial momentum is the same as the total final momentum.
-   Momentum conservation is especially important in collisions, where
    the total momentum just before the collision is the same as the
    total momentum after the collision.
-   The force imparted on an object is equal to the change in momentum
    divided by the time interval over which the objects are in contact.

**Key Applications**

-   Two cars collide head-on … two subatomic particles collide in an
    accelerator … a bird slams into a glass office building: all of
    these are examples of one-dimensional (straight line) collisions.
    For these, pay extra attention to direction: define one direction as
    positive and the other as negative, and be sure everybody gets the
    right sign.
-   A firecracker in mid-air explodes … two children push off each other
    on roller skates … an atomic nucleus breaks apart during a
    radioactive decay: all of these are examples of
    *disintegration* problems. The initial momentum beforehand is zero,
    so the final momentum afterwards must also be zero.
-   A spacecraft burns off momentum by colliding with air molecules as
    it descends … hail stones pummel the top of your car … a wet rag is
    thrown at and sticks to the wall: all of these are examples of
    *impulse* problems, where the change in momentum of one object and
    the reaction to the applied force are considered. What is important
    here is the rate: you need to come up with an average time
    ![\\triangle
    t](ck12_math_images_dir/bed50e92522daceeee2cd1a664044246.png) that
    the collision(s) last so that you can figure out the force ![F =
    \\frac{\\triangle p}{\\triangle
    t}](ck12_math_images_dir/acf63a08385edf393b1472f56eed0d08.png) .
    Remember as well that if a particle has momentum
    ![p](ck12_math_images_dir/0d92185a122383970814caa954a7375b.png) ,
    and it experiences an impulse that turns it around completely, with
    new momentum
    ![-p](ck12_math_images_dir/61008fbb175096f906d9a0adcbb08f18.png) ,
    then the total change in momentum has magnitude
    ![2p](ck12_math_images_dir/47bd4eb403f8f16e473dac9fe264a14a.png) .
    It is harder to turn something totally around than just to stop it!
-   A car going south collides with a second car going east … an
    inflatable ball is thrown into the flow of a waterfall … a billiard
    ball strikes two others, sending all three off in new directions:
    these are all examples of two-dimensional (planar) collisions. For
    these, you get a break: the sum of all the momenta in the
    ![x](ck12_math_images_dir/0f14991bebd0bc5ca2e82990e029d525.png)
    direction have to remain unchanged before and after the collision —
    *independent* of any
    ![y](ck12_math_images_dir/b4a681cb4394e7a28b5b01d49cf52c9e.png)
    momenta, and vice-versa. This is a similar concept to the one we
    used in projectile motion. Motions in different directions are
    independent of each other.

**The Big Idea**

Energy is a measure of the amount of or potential for movement in
something. The total amount of energy in the universe is always the
same. This symmetry is called a conservation law. Conservation of energy
is one of five conservation laws that govern our universe. A group of
things (we’ll use the word *system* ) has a certain amount of energy.
Energy can be added to a system; for instance, when chemical bonds in a
burning log break, they release heat. Energy can be lost from a system;
for instance, when a spacecraft “burns up” its energy of motion during
re-entry, it loses energy and the surrounding atmosphere gains the lost
energy. A *closed* system is one for which the total energy does not
change, or is *conserved* . In this chapter, we will often consider
closed systems, for which the total amount of energy stays the same, but
transforms from one kind to another. The transfer of energy from one
system to another is called *Work* . Work is equal to the amount of
energy transferred *in* (positive work) or *out* (negative work) of a
system. Work is equal to the distance the object is moved multiplied by
the amount of force in the direction of its motion. The *rate* at which
work is done is called *Power* .

    ; The efficiency equals the output power divided by the input power

**Key Concepts**

-   The energy of motion is kinetic energy, KE. Whenever an object is in
    motion it has kinetic energy. The faster it is going, the more
    energy it has.
-   The energy due to gravity is called gravitational potential energy,
    ![PE\_g](ck12_math_images_dir/abec01c5bac01cf83585e91e52e9671e.png)
    , which gets larger the farther off the ground you are.
-   Molecules have chemical potential energy due to the bonds between
    the electrons; when these bonds are broken, energy is released which
    can be transferred into kinetic and/or potential energy. 1 food
    Calorie (1 *kilocalorie* ) is equal to 4180 Joules of stored
    chemical potential energy.
-   Energy can be transformed from one kind into the other; if the total
    energy at the end of the process appears to be less than at the
    beginning, the “lost” energy has been transferred to another system,
    often by heat or sound waves.
-   Work is simply the word for the amount of energy transferred in or
    out of the system. Work can be computed by multiplying the distance
    with the component of force that is parallel to the distance
-   Efficiency is equal to the output energy divided by the
    input energy.

**Key Applications**

-   Work is defined as the product of a force times the distance over
    which the force acts. The force and the distance must act along the
    same line; if the angle between them is not
    ![0\^\\circ](ck12_math_images_dir/e9bd0b69100bdb40159e14266b52a67a.png)
    (or
    ![180\^\\circ](ck12_math_images_dir/2affd5e1fe5d44d45265d37280fafa5f.png) )
    then you must use the component of force; hence the ![\\cos
    \\circleddash
    ](ck12_math_images_dir/332c7a2460fa28226cfc611794e6710a.png) in
    the equation.
-   Mechanical Advantage is the ability to lift or move objects with
    great force while utilizing only a little force. The trade-off is
    that you must operate the smaller input force for a large distance.
    This is all seen through the work Equation. Work equals force
    times distance. Energy is conserved. Thus one can get a large force
    for a small distance equal to a small force for a large distance.
-   Mechanical advantage equals the distance of effort divided by the
    distance the object moves. It is also equal to the output force
    divided by the input force.
-   In “roller coaster” problems, the gravitational potential energy at
    the top of one hill turns into kinetic energy at the bottom of the
    next valley. It turns back into potential energy as you round the
    next hill, and so on. However, some of the energy is lost to the
    tracks and air as heat, which is why the second rise is often not as
    big as the first.
-   When we say energy is lost as heat, often what we mean is that a
    friction force does *negative* work on an object. That negative work
    is lost energy - heat. Keep in mind that work is force
    times distance.
-   In “pendulum” problems, the potential energy at the highest point in
    a pendulum’s swing changes to kinetic energy when it reaches the
    bottom and then back into potential energy when it reaches the
    top again. At any in-between point there is a combination of kinetic
    energy and potential energy, but the total energy remains the same.
-   In everyday life, the human body breaks down the food molecules to
    change some of the bonding energy into energy that is used to power
    the body. This energy goes on to turn into kinetic energy as a
    person moves, or for example an athlete gains speed. The kinetic
    energy can be changed into potential energy as a person gains height
    above the ground.

        it started from rest?
    3.  The shopper brings the cart to rest is 2.7 s when he reaches
        the tofu. What power does he exert in stopping the cart?

5.  Just before your mountain bike ride, you eat a 240 Calorie
    exercise bar. (You can find the conversion between food Calories and
    Joules in the ‘Key Concepts’.) The carbon bonds in the food are
    broken down in your stomach, releasing energy. About half of this
    energy is lost due to inefficiencies in your digestive system.
    1.  Given the losses in your digestive system how much of the
        energy, in Joules, can you use from the exercise bar? After
        eating, you climb a 500 m hill on your bike. The combined mass
        of you and your bike is 75 kg. 
    2.  How much gravitational potential energy has been gained by you
        and your bike? 
    3.  Where did this energy come from?

        half the energy to air resistance, how fast are you going when
        you get to the bottom?

**The Big Ideas**

Heat is a form of energy transfer. Materials do not contain heat. They
contain internal energy that can be transferred (i.e. heat) from one
body to another. Internal energy is the vibrating and rotating and
general jostling of atoms and/or molecules that make up the ‘thing,’
whether it is wood, steel, water. One way to measure the heat of an
object is to measure its temperature. This is really a statement about
its internal kinetic energy.

Heat expansion is a result of the increase of kinetic energy of the
molecules. As their movement increases, they bump into each other more
and the material slightly expands as a result. Most materials expand
with heat. Water is a particularly interesting substance in that it
*contracts* as its temperature increases from ![0\^\\circ
C](ck12_math_images_dir/3ca2585fa7802e652733de1b81288268.png) to
![4\^\\circ
C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) (and then
expands from ![4\^\\circ
C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) to
![100\^\\circ
C](ck12_math_images_dir/a72ab40a485227a68418f2bbb15a5ea4.png) ).

Heat can be transferred in three ways, through conduction, convection,
and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat by physical contact.
Heat flows form the hotter object to the cooler object. Convection is
heat transfer by an intermediate substance (for example air or water).
Your oven (often properly called the ‘convection oven’) works by heating
up the air and then the air heats up your food. Radiation is the release
of heat (and thus the lowering of its internal energy) by releasing
electromagnetic waves. The hotter the object the higher the frequency of
the light emitted. When you look at a fire the blue flames our hotter
than the red flames because blue has a higher frequency than red.

Entropy is a measure of disorder, or the variety of ways in which a
system can organize itself with the same total energy. The entropy of
any isolated system always tends to disorder (i.e. entropy is always
increasing). In the universe, the entropy of a subset (like evolution on
Earth) can decrease (i.e. more order), but the total entropy of the
universe is decreasing (i.e. more disorder).

**Key Concepts**

-   When an object feels cold to the touch, it is because heat is
    flowing from you to the object.
-   When an object feels hot to the touch, it is because heat is flowing
    from the object to you.
-   Some objects (like metals) conduct heat better than others
    (like wood). Thus if you stick a metal rod in the fireplace and hold
    the other end, the heat is conducted well and you get burned. On the
    other hand, if you place a wood stick in the fire and hold the other
    end you’ll be OK.
-   The temperature of a gas is a measure of the amount of average
    kinetic energy that the atoms in the gas possess.
-   If you heat something, you increase its internal energy, so you
    increase the movement of molecules that make up this thing, thus
    it expands. This is called heat expansion; most everything expands
    as heated and contracts as cooled.
-   Most materials expand as they are heated. This can cause bridges to
    collapse if they are not designed to have a place to expand in the
    summer months (like the placing of metal ‘teeth’ at intervals on the
    Golden Gate Bridge).
-   Water *contracts* from ![0\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/3ca2585fa7802e652733de1b81288268.png) to
    ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) and
    then expands from ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) to
    ![100\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/a72ab40a485227a68418f2bbb15a5ea4.png) .
    Remembering that density is mass divided by volume explains why
    water at ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) is
    more dense than water below and above ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) . This
    also explains why lakes freeze on the top first and not throughout.
    As the water on the top of the lake drops below ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) , it
    is now more dense than the water below it, thus it sinks to the
    bottom, allowing the warmer water to rise up to the top and cool
    down in the winter weather. Only when the entirety of the lake is at
    ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) , then
    the lake can start to freeze. It freezes from the top down, because
    water below ![4\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/d519eb5d959682dab58aa7c7c348cebd.png) is
    less dense than water at ![4\^\\circ

-   There are 3 different temperature scales you should know-the Kelvin
    scale, the Celsius scale and the Fahrenheit scale.
-   The Kelvin scale (K) is the one used in most scientific equations
    and has its zero value set at *absolute zero* (the theoretical point
    at which all motion stops).
-   The Celsius scale
    ![(\^\\circ C)](ck12_math_images_dir/ad09772b1960ace885638a0a7fc8567a.png)
    is the standard SI temperature scale. It is equal to the Kelvin
    scale if you minus 273 from the Celsius reading. Water has a boiling
    point of ![100\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/a72ab40a485227a68418f2bbb15a5ea4.png) and a
    freezing point of ![0\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/3ca2585fa7802e652733de1b81288268.png) .
-   The Fahrenheit scale
    ![(\^\\circ F)](ck12_math_images_dir/c5325b6211145e93b3116fb5ee4a7f74.png)
    is the English system and the one we are familiar with.
-   **Newtons’ Law of Cooling:** The rate of heat transfer is
    proportional to the difference in temperature between the
    two objects. For example, hot liquid that is put in the freezer will
    cool much faster than a room temperature liquid that is put in the
    same freezer.
-   **Heat capacity** is the amount of internal energy that the
    substance can store. A large heat capacitance means the substance
    can store a lot of internal energy and thus the temperature
    changes slowly. Aluminum foil has a small heat capacitance and water
    has a large one.
-   The amount of heat capacitance (and thus its specific heat value) is
    related to something called ‘degrees of freedom,’ which basically
    says how free is the object to move in different ways (and thus how
    much kinetic energy can it store inside itself without
    breaking apart). For example, solids have a more fixed structure, so
    they cannot rotate and jostle as much, so they can’t store as much
    internal energy so they have lower heat capacitance then liquids.
-   **Specific heat** is similar to heat capacitance, but is a
    specific number. The specific heat tells you how much energy one
    must put in per unit mass in order to raise the temperature
    ![1\^\\circ
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/f21a43d1263556baa4ae7b144828ff84.png) .
-   **Phase changes** : it takes energy to changes phases from a solid
    to a liquid and from a liquid to a gas. The substance releases
    energy when changing phase from gas to liquid or from liquid
    to solid. How much energy per unit mass depends on the substance
    in question. When you get out of the shower you often feel cold.
    This is because the water on you is evaporating, and heat is flowing
    from you to the water droplets in order for them to change phase
    from water to gas. You are losing heat and thus feel cold.

**Key Application**

-   The human body radiates heat in the range of infrared light. Night
    goggles work by ‘seeing’ the infrared light emitted by our bodies.

</span>

-   The thermostat works with a bi-metallic strip. A bi-metallic strip
    is a flat rectangular object with two different metal strips glued
    together back to back. In the example above (courtesy
    of ‘hyperphysics’) we have brass and steel. Brass has a larger heat
    expansion than steel. When the temperature gets Hotter, the brass
    strip will expand more than the steel one and thus the strip will
    bend downward, triggering the thermostat to turn on the
    air conditioner. When the Temperature goes below the set value, then
    the brass one contracts more than the steel one and it bends upward.
    This triggers the heating to be turned on.
-   A calorie is a unit of energy. The food Calorie, with a capital
    ![C](ck12_math_images_dir/e97e00897680a9985f8688553bb4ca5f.png) , is
    actually 1,000 calories (a kcal). Thus, for example, a snicker bar
    labeled with 200 Cal is actually 200,000 cal.
-   Food calories are determined by burning the food and measuring the
    heat released.
-   The human body is at a temperature that radiates away heat in the
    form of infrared wavelengths. Night goggles work by ‘seeing’ the
    infrared light and then converting it into visible light (the green
    screen you usually see in the movies is because the conversion is
    usually done with a phosphorous screen).
-   For electronics in space, one must use very large heat sinks to
    radiate away the heat from components and chips like the processor.
    Since there is no air in space, a fan will not do anything. The
    processor chip cannot release heat built up by convection, so it
    must radiate it away over a large heat sink.
-   More than 50% of the water rise expected from global warming is due
    to the thermal expansion of water (more on greenhouse effect below).

**The Greenhouse Effect**

**Greenhouse Effect:** The solar energy reaching the surface of the
Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate
the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth,
however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of
energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially
absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned
to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium
and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more
greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped
terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global
temperature.

**Current Situation** : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse
gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about
![1.0 \\
W/m\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/1973bda5a83b341617bcd5b3033ca522.png) .
Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration
of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse
gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further.
There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional
section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse
gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the
foreseeable future).

**Possible Effects That Can Accelerate Global Warming:**

1.  **Time Lag:** The excess energy warms the ocean very slowly, due to
    water’s high heat capacity. Even in the unlikely event that no more
    greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere the temperature
    increase already measured will be almost doubled.
2.  **The Effect of Water Vapor:** Increasing temperatures will lead to
    more evaporation and more water vapor in the atmosphere. Water vapor
    is a greenhouse gas and its increased presence may cause further
    warming in a positive feedback loop. On the other hand if the water
    vapor results in more clouds more solar radiation will be reflected,
    a possible negative feedback.
3.  **Albedo** is the amount of light reflected by a surface. Sea ice
    has an albedo of .85, meaning 85% of light is reflected back from
    its surface (and leaves the Earth) and 15% is absorbed and stays in
    the Earth; ice-free water has an albedo of .07. (93% of the solar
    energy is absorbed.) Thus the observed melting of sea ice could
    amplify the effect of global warming
4.  The **Melting of the Artic Permafrost** also has an amplifying
    effect by releasing carbon dioxide and methane that is normally
    trapped in the tundra.
5.  Warmer oceans are hostile to **algae and cytoplankton** , which are
    the most important absorbers of carbon dioxide. The loss of these
    two photosynthesizers would remove the most important natural
    ![CO\_2](ck12_math_images_dir/3b5e57882a3317498ddada67b9cacc72.png) sink.
6.  **Loss of Rain Forests** would have a similar effect. Global warming
    is likely to lead to desertification of the habitats of
    rain forests. The rain forest is the second most important
    ![CO\_2](ck12_math_images_dir/3b5e57882a3317498ddada67b9cacc72.png) sink.

**The Big Idea**

In the absence of a net force, objects move in a straight line. If they
turn — that is, if their velocity changes, *even only in direction* —
there must be an applied force. Forces which cause objects to turn
around continuously in a circle are known as *centripetal* forces. When
an object moves in a circle its velocity at any particular instant
points in a direction *tangent* to the circle. The acceleration points
towards the center of the circle, and so does the force acting on it.
This is only natural, when you think about it — if you feel a force
pushing you towards your left as you walk forward, you will walk in a
circle, always turning left.

**Key Equations**

-   ![a\_C =
    \\frac{v\^2}{r}](ck12_math_images_dir/2e7c4d0b2efefc9198de6c2733de9816.png)
    ; the acceleration of an object moving at constant speed and going
    in a circle is equal to the square of its speed divided by the
    radius of the circle.
-   ![F\_C = ma\_C =
    \\frac{mv\^2}{r}](ck12_math_images_dir/e2283f26ea07c96108e155b181b6c4e4.png)
    ; if an object of mass
    ![m](ck12_math_images_dir/de65f173073697541b369ca6047387a8.png)
    moves in a circle of radius
    ![r](ck12_math_images_dir/9974653e84d2f053b7332855e1e817c3.png) at
    speed
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) ,
    the force acting on it must be equal to this value. The direction of
    this force is always pointed towards the center of the circle.

**Key Concepts**

-   Centripetal Force is an umbrella term that refers to any force that
    makes something move in a circle. Examples of forces that can be
    centripetal forces are as follows: *Gravity* (the gravity between
    the Earth and Sun causes the Earth to go in a circle), *Friction*
    (the friction force between a car’s tires and the road causes the
    car to turn), Tension (when swinging a bucket around in a circle by
    holding onto the string, the tension of the string is the
    centripetal force)
-   An object moving in a circle has an instantaneous velocity
    *tangential* to the circle of its path. The force and acceleration
    point to the center of the circle.
-   Net force and acceleration *always* have the same direction.
-   An orbital period,
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) , is
    the time it takes to make one complete rotation.
-   If a particle travels a distance ![2 \\pi
    r](ck12_math_images_dir/9f01472b70564901827fb59a4a34bb1b.png) in an
    amount of time
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) ,
    then its speed is distance over time or ![\\frac{2 \\pi
    r}{T}](ck12_math_images_dir/84dca116b24a60b85fe0db5b341f4181.png) .
-   The centripetal force can by comprised of more than one force. For
    example, with roller coasters, the centripetal force at the top of a
    loop is the addition of the force of gravity and the normal force,
    both of which are acting on the rollercoaster and both pointing down
    from the top and, thus, towards the center of the circle. Note at
    the bottom of the loop, one would subtract the force of gravity from
    the normal force to find the centripetal force.
-   Centripetal acceleration is just the acceleration provided by
    centripetal forces and can be found by dividing the centripetal
    force by the objects mass.

**Key Applications**

-   To find the maximum speed that a car can take a corner on a flat
    road without skidding out, set the force of friction equal to the
    centripetal force.
-   Banked turns (the road is not flat, but rather at an angle) allow
    for a greater speed before skidding out. In this case the normal
    force aids the force of friction in creating a larger centripetal
    force than that which can be obtained by friction alone on a
    flat road. It’s not as simple as adding them together, one must
    consider the components of these two forces in the direction to the
    center of the circle.

-   To find the tension in the rope of a swinging pendulum, remember
    that it is the *sum* of the tension and gravity that produces a net
    upward centripetal force. A common mistake is just setting the
    centripetal force equal to the tension.
-   To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, realize that
    the force of gravity is the centripetal force. So set the force of
    gravity equal to
    ![\\frac{mv\^2}{r}](ck12_math_images_dir/4067dcf17c93a432fb1c748c540f7f3c.png)
    , where
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) is
    the speed of the planet,
    ![m](ck12_math_images_dir/de65f173073697541b369ca6047387a8.png) is
    the mass of the planet or satellite and
    ![r](ck12_math_images_dir/9974653e84d2f053b7332855e1e817c3.png) is
    the distance of the planet to the sun or the satellite to the Earth.

    spin several times per second. (Try to imagine this in your head.)
    Consider a neutron star of radius 10 km that spins with a period of
    0.8 seconds. Imagine a person is standing at the equator of this
    neutron star.
    1.  Calculate the centripetal acceleration of this person and
        compare it to the acceleration
        ![g](ck12_math_images_dir/445b8ec61d85010de66aebf640d2eb84.png)
        due to gravity on Earth.
    2.  Now, find the minimum acceleration due to gravity that the
        neutron star must have in order to keep the person from
        flying off.

15. A student comes up to you and says, “I can visualize the force of
    tension, the force of friction, and the other forces, but I can’t
    visualize *centripetal* force.” As you know, a centripetal force
    must be *provided* by tension, friction, or some other
    “familiar” force. Write a two or three sentence explanation, in your
    own words, to help the confused student.
16. Calculate the centripetal acceleration of the Earth around the Sun.
17. You are speeding around a turn of radius 30.0 m at a constant speed

    1.  What is the minimum force of friction between your car tires and
        the road necessary for you to retain control?
    2.  Even if the road is terribly icy, you will still move in a
        circle because you are slamming into the walls. What centripetal
        forces (in the form of a Normal Force) must the walls exert
        on you. Assume you do not lose speed during the turn.

**The Big Idea**

Over 2500 years ago Aristotle proposed two laws of physics governing
motion. One for ‘Earthly bodies’ (objects on Earth) that states objects
naturally go in straight lines and one for ‘Heavenly bodies’ (objects in
space) that states objects naturally go in circles. This idea held
steady for 2,000 years, until Isaac Newton in a triumph of brilliance
declared that there is one law of physics that governs motion and he
unified “earthly” bodies and “heavenly” bodies with the The Universal
Law of Gravitation. Newton used the universal law of gravity to prove
that the moon is accelerating towards Earth just as a body on Earth is
falling towards Earth. The acceleration of both the moon and the object
on Earth is calculated using the same formula. This theory is so well
regarded that it has been used to hypothesize the existence of black
holes and dark matter, later verified by observation. The search to
unify the laws of physics into one theory continues today and is often
referred to as the yet undiscovered Grand Unified Theory (GUT).

**Key Equation: The Universal Law of Gravity**

-   ![F\_G
    =\\frac{Gm\_1m\_2}{r\^2}](ck12_math_images_dir/c6e0ed3031820a6f0fc5bd96b3f9e872.png)
    ; the force of gravity between an object with mass
    ![m\_1](ck12_math_images_dir/b5cb5f13f42a55d39fd84b4ba9dad422.png)
    and another object of mass
    ![m\_2](ck12_math_images_dir/bac3260b819a3b6711c48cbcd8105364.png)
    and a distance between them of
    ![r](ck12_math_images_dir/9974653e84d2f053b7332855e1e817c3.png) .
-   ![G = 6.67 \\times 10\^{-11} \\ Nm\^2 /
    kg\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/f7ae8a063afcf351751acc47e92e6ce2.png) ;
    the universal constant of gravity
-   ![g =
    \\frac{Gm}{r\^2}](ck12_math_images_dir/f041f30b1de766bcb72c481a3cc1fe1a.png)
    ; gravitational field strength or gravitational acceleration of a
    planet with mass
    ![m](ck12_math_images_dir/de65f173073697541b369ca6047387a8.png) and
    radius
    ![r](ck12_math_images_dir/9974653e84d2f053b7332855e1e817c3.png) .
    Note that this is not really a separate equation but comes from
    Newton’s second law and the law of universal gravitation.

**Key Concepts**

-   When using the Universal Law of Gravity formula and the constant
    ![G](ck12_math_images_dir/18f719202165d5d501571583693fc4d1.png)
    above, make sure to use units of meters and kilograms.
-   Newton invented calculus in order to prove that for a spherical
    object (like Earth) one can assume all of its mass is at the center
    of the sphere (thus in his formula, one can use the radius of Earth
    for the distance between a falling rock and Earth).
-   An orbital period,
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) , is
    the time it takes to make one complete rotation.
-   If a particle travels a distance ![2 \\pi
    r](ck12_math_images_dir/9f01472b70564901827fb59a4a34bb1b.png) in an
    amount of time
    ![T](ck12_math_images_dir/a7284843d100e640c0e00ae83ab66a90.png) ,
    then its speed is distance over time or ![\\frac{2 \\pi
    r}{T}](ck12_math_images_dir/84dca116b24a60b85fe0db5b341f4181.png) .
-   Objects in orbit around each other, orbit about the center of mass
    for the system. For the Earth and moon the center of mass is
    somewhere inside of Earth. So while the moon orbits Earth, the Earth
    also orbits the moon (manifested as a slight wobble).

**Key Applications**

-   To find the speed of a planet or satellite in an orbit, realize that
    the force of gravity is the centripetal force. So set the force of
    gravity equal to
    ![\\frac{mv\^2}{r}](ck12_math_images_dir/4067dcf17c93a432fb1c748c540f7f3c.png)
    , where
    ![v](ck12_math_images_dir/ab157ad37ef6efcf3559476aa5ec6133.png) is
    the speed of the planet,
    ![m](ck12_math_images_dir/de65f173073697541b369ca6047387a8.png) is
    the mass of the planet or satellite and
    ![r](ck12_math_images_dir/9974653e84d2f053b7332855e1e817c3.png) is
    the distance of the planet to the sun or the satellite to the Earth.
-   The Geo-synchronous orbit is that orbit for which the satellite
    takes the same amount of time to orbit the planet as the planet
    takes to make one revolution. For satellites to be over the same
    place of the planet at all times, it must be in a
    Geo-synchronous orbit.
-   Some data needed for the problems:

**Gravity Problem Set**

1.  Which is greater – the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on
    the moon, or the force the moon exerts on the Earth? Why doesn’t the
    moon fall into the earth?
2.  Which is greater – the gravitational force that the Sun exerts on
    the moon, or the force the Earth exerts on the moon? Does the moon
    orbit the Earth or the Sun? Explain.
3.  Suppose you’re standing in an elevator on a bathroom scale. Draw a
    FBD for you and label the two forces acting on you. Describe how the
    scale reading compares to your weight when
    1.  The elevator is at rest
    2.  The elevator is moving up at a constant speed
    3.  The elevator is accelerating upward
    4.  The cable breaks and the elevator is in free fall

4.  Astronauts in orbit are not beyond the pull of earth’s gravity – in
    fact, gravity is what KEEPS them in orbit! So why are they
    “weightless”? Explain briefly.
5.  Use Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation to explain why even though
    Jupiter has 300 times the mass of the earth, on the “surface” of
    Jupiter you’d weigh only 3 times what you weigh on earth. What other
    factor has to be considered here?
6.  Suppose we drilled a hole through the earth and dropped in a rock.
    How would the speed and acceleration of the rock vary as the rock
    falls into the earth? Would the rock come shooting out of the other
    side of the earth, or would it oscillate back and forth? Use a
    diagram in your explanation.
7.  There are basically three possible fates for a star that reaches the
    end of its life: white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. What’s
    the main factor that determines which one a star will become? Which
    will our sun become? Explain what a black hole is. You may have to
    do a little research for this one.
8.  Do some research online to answer this question: there are three
    huge pieces of evidence for the Big Bang. Two cosmological phenomena
    called *the cosmic microwave background radiation* and *the
    expansion of the universe.* The third is called *nucleosynthesis.*
    Explain/define each, and briefly discuss how each supports the Big
    Bang theory. How do astronomers know the universe is expanding?

    1.  Calculate the force of gravity between a falling object (for
        example an apple) and that of Earth. Use the symbol
        ![m\_o](ck12_math_images_dir/d2b8f07b656b9fda25d4e1661accc553.png)
        to represent the mass of the falling object.
    2.  Now divide that force by the object’s mass to find the
        acceleration
        ![g](ck12_math_images_dir/445b8ec61d85010de66aebf640d2eb84.png)
        of the object.
    3.  Calculate the force of gravity between the Sun and the Earth.

10. Calculate the force of gravity between two human beings, assuming
    that each has a mass of 80 kg and that they are standing 1 m apart.
    Is this a large force?
11. What is the force of gravity between an electron and a proton? Do
    you think this is what keeps the electron ‘orbiting’ the proton in
    the hydrogen atom?
12. Calculate the gravitational force that your pencil or pen pulls
    on you. Use the center of your chest as the center of mass (and thus
    the mark for the distance measurement) and estimate all masses
    and distances.
    1.  If there were no other forces present, what would your
        acceleration be towards your pencil? Is this a large or small
        acceleration?
    2.  Why, in fact, doesn’t your pencil accelerate towards you?

13. Mo and Jo have been traveling through the galaxy for eons when they

**The Big Idea**

*Conservation of charge* is the fourth of the 5 conservation laws in
physics. There are two charges, + and -, and the symmetry of the
electric charge indicates that the total charge in the universe remains
the same. In any closed system, charge can be transferred from one body
to another but the amount of electric charge in the universe remains the
same.

*Electromagnetism* is associated with charge and is a fundamental force
of nature like gravity. If charges are static (i.e. not moving) the
electromagnetic force is the *Coulomb electric force* . In the same way
that the gravitational force depends on mass, the Coulomb electric force
depends on the property known as electric *charge* . Like gravity the
Coulomb electric Force decreases with the square of the distance. The
Coulomb electric force is responsible for many of the forces discussed
previously: the normal force, contact forces, friction, and so on… *all*
of these forces arise in the mutual attraction and repulsion of charged
particles.

The law determining the magnitude of the Coulomb electric force has the
same form as the law of gravity. The electric constant is 20 orders of
magnitude greater than the gravitational constant. That is why
electricity normally dominates gravity at the atomic and molecular
level. However, gravity will dominate in large bodies. The reason is
that atoms and molecules have equal number of positive and negative
charges and are therefore electrically neutral (thus the Coulomb
electric force is canceled out).

**Key Equations**

    ; the total charge of an object is always some integer

    ; the force exerted by two charges on one another depends on the
    amount of the charge, the distance between them, and a fundamental
    constant ![k = 9 \\times 10\^9
    Nm\^2/C\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/62106fbc4b95c4590784e426964b736b.png) .
-   ![F = qE](ck12_math_images_dir/24283af627c8835aeb230a2bfb8f8eab.png)
    ; a charged object in an electric field feels a force.
-   ![E =
    \\frac{kq}{r\^2}](ck12_math_images_dir/46e3501b51a37fe4b8eaedd366ebd8e7.png)
    ; the electric field produced by a charged object depends on the
    charge of the object and the distance to the object. through a
    changing electric potential.
-   ![E = \\frac{- \\Delta V}{\\Delta
    x}](ck12_math_images_dir/fc4299e9db5832e6993de41e632cf8ae.png) ; the
    electric field depends on how quickly the electric potential varies
    over space; alternatively ![\\Delta V = - E \\cdot \\Delta
    x](ck12_math_images_dir/1887629b08a2372ebb1821f3cc4f5acb.png) .
-   ![V =
    \\frac{kq}{r}](ck12_math_images_dir/325253647402bac95d7ec6c51b7e949a.png)
    ; the electric potential produced by a charged object depends on the
    charge of the object and the distance to the object.

**Key Concepts**

-   In any process, electric charge is conserved. The total electric
    charge of the universe does not change. Therefore, electric charge
    can only be transferred – not lost – from one body to another.
-   Electrons have negative charge and protons have positive charge. The
    magnitude of the charge is the same for both, ![e = 1.6 \\times
    10\^{-19}\\
    C](ck12_math_images_dir/2af51684b888e5c24b3351fc483ca10c.png) .
-   Normally, electric charge is transferred when electrons leave the
    outer orbits of the atoms of one body (leaving it
    positively charged) and move to the surface of another body (causing
    the new surface to gain a negative net charge). In a plasma all
    electrons are stripped from the atoms, leaving positively charged
    ions and free electrons.
-   Similarly charged objects have a repulsive force between them.
    Oppositely charged objects have an attractive force between them.
-   The value of the electric field tells you the force that a charged
    object would feel *if* it entered this field. Electric field lines
    tell you the direction a positive charge would go if it were placed
    in the field.
-   Electric potential is measured in units of Volts
    ![(V)](ck12_math_images_dir/1456c520158ddff967fd98f9c0438599.png) –
    thus electric potential is often referred to as “voltage.”
-   Positive charges move towards lower electric potential; negative
    charges move toward higher electric potential

**Key Applications**

-   In problems that ask for excess negative or positive charge,
    remember that each electron has one unit of the fundamental charge
    ![e](ck12_math_images_dir/5852a98846ffe2945283eaa69ce12790.png) .
-   To find the speed of a particle after it traverses a voltage
    difference, use the equation for the conservation of energy: ![q
    \\Delta V =
    \\frac{1}{2}mv\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/4b4e12df82161aee72d9c822612ddc9a.png)
-   Force and electric field are vectors and thus have direction as well
    as their value.
-   Electric field lines point from high electric potential to low
    potential and are perpendicular to the electric potential line. Note
    that this agrees with the fact that electric field lines tell you
    the direction a positive charge would travel, since positive charges
    go from high potential (i.e. big voltage) to low potential (i.e.
    low voltage).

**The Big Ideas:**

The name *electric current* is the name given to the phenomenon that
occurs when an electric field moves down a wire at close to the speed of
light. *Voltage* is the electrical energy density that causes the
electric current. *Resistance* is the amount a device in the wire
resists the flow of current by converting electrical energy into other
forms of energy. A device, the resistor, could be a light bulb,
transferring electrical energy into heat and light or an electric motor
that converts electric energy into mechanical energy. The difference in
Voltage across a resistor or other electrical device is called the
*voltage drop.*

In electric *circuits* (closed loops of wire with resistors and voltage
sources) energy must be conserved. It follows that the algebraic sum of
voltage drops and voltage sources, around any closed loop, will equal
zero.

In an electric *junction* there is more than one possible path for
current to flow. For charge to be conserved at a junction the current
into the junction must equal the current out of the junction.

**Key Equations:**

-   ![I = \\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta
    t}](ck12_math_images_dir/5b8d2abafc34cc820d8156e0c4726778.png) -
    current is the rate at which charge passes by; the units of current
    are Amperes ![(1 \\ A = 1
    \\ C/s)](ck12_math_images_dir/e784d19cd611a98f8d1e0ee8f727cbfe.png) .
-   ![\\Delta V = I \\cdot
    R](ck12_math_images_dir/5d4379cacd561cfd80d3f866726e29d9.png) - the
    current flow through a resistor depends on the applied electric
    potential difference across it; the units of resistance are Ohms
    ![(1 \\ \\Omega = 1
    \\ V/A)](ck12_math_images_dir/6b56ad62aa19fca243bfa0641191d88e.png) .
-   ![P = I \\cdot \\Delta
    V](ck12_math_images_dir/3bece761ad92ab88511ff61cc86fa0f6.png) - the
    power dissipated by a resistor is the product of the current through
    the resistor and the applied electric potential difference across
    it; the units of power are Watts ![(1 \\ W = 1
    \\ J/s)](ck12_math_images_dir/3fea0395207c0dba00a00686f04fdcd5.png) .
-   ![E = P \\cdot
    t](ck12_math_images_dir/72cb9cfa974a8217450323893d80965f.png) - the
    electrical energy used is equal to the power dissipated multiplied
    by the time the circuit is running

**Key Concepts:**

-   **Ohm’s Law**
    ![V=IR](ck12_math_images_dir/ca04a452e020c56595efe92c8091fe54.png)
    (Voltage drop equals current times resistance.) This is the main
    equation for electric circuits but it is often misused. In order to
    calculate the voltage drop across a light bulb use the formula:
    ![V\_{lightbulb} =
    I\_{lightbulb}R\_{lightbulb}](ck12_math_images_dir/86ec01cde1410c0ba5e039cd9a78efca.png) .
    For the *total* current flowing out of the power source, you need
    the *total* resistance of the circuit and the *total* current:
    ![V\_{total} =
    I\_{total}R\_{total}](ck12_math_images_dir/2b7bfde8ca4e5740bd0ce5ef0daafaee.png) .
-   **Power** is the rate that energy is released. The units for power
    are watts (W), which equal joules per second ![\[W\] =
    \[J\]/\[s\]](ck12_math_images_dir/5cca589ce25859a82c78d45adfb5b24c.png) .
    For example, a 60 W light bulb transforms 60 joules of electrical
    energy into light and heat energy every second.

The equation used to calculate the **power** dissipated in a circuit is
![P=IV](ck12_math_images_dir/9f2176a115c70ca1ed483184522a4067.png) . As
with Ohm’s Law, one must be careful not to mix apples with oranges. If
you want the power of the entire circuit, then you multiply the *total*
voltage of the power source by the *total* current coming out of the
power source. If you want the power dissipated (i.e. released) by a
light bulb, then you multiply the *voltage drop* across the light bulb
by the *current going through that light bulb.*

-   **Resistors in Series:** All resistors are connected end to end.
    There is only one river, so they all receive the same current. But
    since there is a voltage drop across each resistor, they may all
    have different voltages across them – the sum of the voltage drops
    will equal the total voltage of the circuit. The more resistors in
    series the more rocks in the river, so the less current that flows.

</dd>
</dl>
-   **Resistors in Parallel:** All resistors are connected together at
    both ends. There are many rivers (i.e. the main river branches off
    into many other rivers), so all resistors receive different amounts
    of current. But since they are all connected to the same point at
    both ends they all receive the same voltage.

-   **Direct Current (DC):** Voltage pushes (so current flows) in
    one direction. Examples are batteries and the power supplies we use
    in class. Any time there’s a boxy device you plug into the wall
    (like a charger), its purpose is to convert AC from the wall to DC.
-   **Alternating Current (AC):** Voltage pushes (so current flows) in
    alternate directions, back and forth. In the US they reverse
    direction 60 times a second (60 Hz). AC is more convenient than DC
    for transporting electrical energy. Below is a plot of voltage vs.
    time for a standard circuit in the USA.

*Note: your TV and computer screen are actually flickering at 60 Hz due
to the AC supplied by household plugs. Our eyesight does not work this
fast, so we never notice it. However, if you film a TV the effect is
observable due to the mismatched frame rates of the camera (usually 24
fps) and screen.*

-   **Ammeter:** A device that measures electric current. You must break
    the circuit to measure the current. Ammeters have very low
    resistance; therefore you must wire them in series.
-   **Voltmeter:** A device that measures voltage. In order to measure a
    voltage difference between two points, place the probes down on the
    wires for the two points. Do not break the circuit. Voltmeters have
    very high resistance; therefore you must wire them in parallel.
-   **Voltage source:** A power source that produces fixed voltage
    regardless of what is hooked up to it. A battery is a real-life
    voltage source. A battery can be thought of as a perfect voltage
    source with a small resistor (called internal resistance) in series.
    The electric energy density produced by the chemistry of the battery
    is called **emf** ( <span class="x-ck12-underline"> e </span> lectro
    <span class="x-ck12-underline"> m </span> otive <span
    class="x-ck12-underline"> f </span> orce), but the amount of voltage
    available from the battery is called **terminal voltage** . The
    terminal voltage equals the emf minus the voltage drop across the
    internal resistance (current of the external circuit times the
    internal resistance.)

**Conservation of Energy & Electrical Efficiency:**

Electrical energy is useful to us mostly because it is easy to transport
and can be easily converted to or from other forms of energy. Of course,
conversion involves wast, typically as heat.

Electrical energy consumed can be determined by multiplying power by
time ![(E =
Pt)](ck12_math_images_dir/0049c1e90af61482cc0d4ba89395e7a3.png) . Recall
the equations for mechanical and thermal energy/work ![(PE=mgh,
KE=1/2mv\^2, Q=mc \\Delta
T)](ck12_math_images_dir/b34bf2e7d63ab7a6e9f7c3102f8eba82.png) . An
important idea is the *efficiency* of an electrical device: the fraction
of electrical energy consumed that goes into doing useful work
![(W\_{out}/E\_{in})](ck12_math_images_dir/760603637f92db5e5a648ee282ec3c57.png)
, expressed as a percentage.

***Example:***

You use a 100 W electric motor to lift a 10 kg mass 5 m, and it takes 20
s.

The <span class="x-ck12-underline"> electrical energy consumed </span>
is ![E\_{elec} = P \\cdot t = (100 \\ W) (20 \\ s) = 2000 \\
J](ck12_math_images_dir/94e2ba9034842a83d9434c78bd548400.png)

The <span class="x-ck12-underline"> work done </span> is against
gravity, so we use ![PE = mgh = (10 \\ kg) (10 \\ m/s\^2) (5 \\ m) = 500
\\ J](ck12_math_images_dir/9e06bc59ff12079855962838d947f999.png)

The efficiency is ![W\_{out}/E\_{in} = (500 \\ J) / (2000 \\ J) = 0.25 =
25\\% \\

**3 Example Problems for Circuits**

1\) A circuit is wired up with two resistors in series.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->

Both resistors are in the same ‘river’, so both have the same current
flowing through them. Neither resistor has a direct connection to the
power supply so neither has 20V across it. But the combined voltages
across the individual resistors add up to 20V.

**Question:** What is the total resistance of the circuit?

**Answer:** The <span class="x-ck12-underline"> total </span> resistance
is ![R\_{total}=R\_1+R\_2=90 \\Omega+10 \\Omega=100
\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/40e93bbf210b9af82c5ac00416235258.png)

**Question:** What is the total current coming out of the power supply?

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s Law
![(V=IR)](ck12_math_images_dir/49fb23168fd2b8ee48e32403ebf986d4.png) but
solve for current
![(I=V/R)](ck12_math_images_dir/3a9cbed83ae300bee0aef3d1d9d711e7.png) .

![I\_{total}=\\frac{V\_{total}}{R\_{total}}=\\frac{20V}{100\\Omega}=0.20A](ck12_math_images_dir/39e727729d89efe9a8e6eb7e602f1354.png)

**Question:** How much power does the power supply dissipate?

**Answer:**
![P=IV](ck12_math_images_dir/9f2176a115c70ca1ed483184522a4067.png) , so
the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total
current. Thus,
![P\_{total}=I\_{total}V\_{total}=(0.20A)(20V)=4.0W](ck12_math_images_dir/2bbe7e4e88bd0394aa15aecf7d27b7f1.png)
. So the Power Supply is outputting 4W (i.e. 4 Joules of energy per
second).

**Question:** How much power does each resistor dissipate?

**Answer:** Each resistor has different voltage across it, but the same
current. So, using Ohm’s law, convert the power formula into a form that
does not depend on voltage.

![P&=IV=I(IR)=I\^2R.\\\\P\_{90 \\Omega} &=
I\^2\_{90\\Omega}R\_{90\\Omega}=(0.2A)\^2(90\\Omega)=3.6W\\\\P\_{10
\\Omega} &=
I\^2\_{10\\Omega}R\_{10\\Omega}=(0.2A)\^2(10\\Omega)=0.4W](ck12_math_images_dir/1a6a706364b0be80e08a0c6b2c73cf08.png)

![\^\*](ck12_math_images_dir/7b4df4c53501bd92171b7de0a5ab4eff.png) Note:
If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total
power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.

**Question:** How much voltage is there across each resistor?

**Answer:** In order to calculate voltage across a resistor, use Ohm’s
law.

![V\_{90\\Omega} &=
I\_{90\\Omega}R\_{90\\Omega}=(0.2A)(90\\Omega)=18V\\\\V\_{10\\Omega} &=
I\_{10\\Omega}R\_{10\\Omega}=(0.2A)(10\\Omega)=2V](ck12_math_images_dir/438cd5276660629400fba52d7f1a56a4.png)

![\^\*](ck12_math_images_dir/7b4df4c53501bd92171b7de0a5ab4eff.png) Note:
If you add up the voltages across the individual resistors you will
obtain the total voltage of the circuit, as you should. Further note
that with the voltages we can use the original form of the Power
equation
![(P=IV)](ck12_math_images_dir/5e326345419b6802959e8337e7db5d35.png) ,
and we should get the same results as above.

![P\_{90\\Omega} &=
I\_{90\\Omega}V\_{90\\Omega}=(18V)(0.2A)=3.6W\\\\P\_{10\\Omega} &=
I\_{10\\Omega}V\_{10\\Omega}=(2.0V)(0.2A)=0.4W](ck12_math_images_dir/d3586072b4d415d053d74003f48cb22c.png)

Both resistors are directly connected to the power supply, so both have
the same 20V across them. But they are on different ‘rivers’ so they
have different current flowing through them. Lets go through the same
questions and answers as with the circuit in series.

**Question:** What is the total resistance of the circuit?

**Answer:** The <span class="x-ck12-underline"> total </span> resistance
is
![\\frac{1}{R\_{total}}=\\frac{1}{R\_1}+\\frac{1}{R\_2}=\\frac{1}{90\\Omega}+\\frac{1}{10\\Omega}=\\frac{1}{90\\Omega}+\\frac{9}{90\\Omega}=\\frac{10}{90\\Omega}](ck12_math_images_dir/9cd480f7e4c84851ab94aa46824c531a.png)
thus,
![R\_{total}=\\frac{90\\Omega}{10}=9\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/25be4de71c5d2967beb32496f8cd07a6.png)

![\^\*](ck12_math_images_dir/7b4df4c53501bd92171b7de0a5ab4eff.png) Note:
Total resistance for a circuit in parallel will always be smaller than
smallest resistor in the circuit.

**Question:** What is the total current coming out of the power supply?

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s Law
![(V=IR)](ck12_math_images_dir/49fb23168fd2b8ee48e32403ebf986d4.png) but
solve for current
![(I=V/R)](ck12_math_images_dir/3a9cbed83ae300bee0aef3d1d9d711e7.png) .

![I\_{total}=\\frac{V\_{total}}{R\_{total}}=\\frac{20V}{9\\Omega}=2.2A](ck12_math_images_dir/35c93e1a8561b89e6f4e689610e1c029.png)

**Question:** How much power does the power supply dissipate?

**Answer:**
![P=IV](ck12_math_images_dir/9f2176a115c70ca1ed483184522a4067.png) , so
the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total
current. Thus,
![P\_{total}=I\_{total}V\_{total}=(2.2A)(20V)=44.4W](ck12_math_images_dir/0b4e927861d3f7fd0f37e5fc346089f1.png)
. So the Power Supply outputs 44W (i.e. 44 Joules of energy per second).

**Question:** How much power is each resistor dissipating?

**Answer:** Each resistor has different current across it, but the same
voltage. So, using Ohm’s law, convert the power formula into a form that
does not depend on current. ![P=IV=\\left(\\frac{V}{R}\\right)
V=\\frac{V\^2}{R}](ck12_math_images_dir/7d7faa563f8b39d7fec75a8524acf58c.png)
Substituted
![I=V/R](ck12_math_images_dir/889b7c4a8216d33c9c04dfe6fd52391e.png) into
the power formula.
![P\_{90\\Omega}=\\frac{V\^2\_{90\\Omega}}{R\_{90\\Omega}}=\\frac{(20V)\^2}{90\\Omega}=4.4W;
P\_{10\\Omega}=\\frac{V\^2\_{10\\Omega}}{R\_{10}\\Omega}=\\frac{(20V)\^2}{10\\Omega}=40W](ck12_math_images_dir/e8a0d31f3dd37f87c4e24b8d93af0154.png)

![\^\*](ck12_math_images_dir/7b4df4c53501bd92171b7de0a5ab4eff.png) Note:
If you add up the power dissipated by each resistor, it equals the total
power outputted, as it should–Energy is always conserved.

**Question:** How much current is flowing through each resistor?

**Answer:** Use Ohm’s law to calculate the current for each resistor.

![I\_{90\\Omega}=\\frac{V\_{90\\Omega}}{R\_{90\\Omega}}=\\frac{20V}{90\\Omega}=0.22A
\\qquad
I\_{10\\Omega}=\\frac{V\_{10\\Omega}}{R\_{10\\Omega}}=\\frac{20V}{10\\Omega}=2.0A](ck12_math_images_dir/6f92cb3c5d353ebbefa6879858aac133.png)

Notice that the
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
resistor has the most current going through it. It has the least
resistance to electricity so this makes sense.

![\^\*](ck12_math_images_dir/7b4df4c53501bd92171b7de0a5ab4eff.png) Note:
If you add up the currents of the individual ‘rivers’ you get the total
current of the of the circuit, as you should.

**Question:** What is the total resistance of the circuit?

**Answer:** In order to find the total resistance we do it in steps (see
pictures. First add the ![90
\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/b6cb8ae19300912d6fac4823d00b1501.png) and

in series to make one equivalent resistance of
![100\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/78d7180c745fc2aa0f957182dfbfa9de.png)
(see diagram at right). Then add the

to the
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
in parallel to get one resistor of
![9.1\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/8e311a2a0fd072812d30ea18fe251c38.png)
. Now we have two resistors in series, simply add them to get the total
resistance of
![29.1\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/c74686984711e7d9d49ea2627061ba4c.png)

**Answer:**
![P=IV](ck12_math_images_dir/9f2176a115c70ca1ed483184522a4067.png) , so
the total power equals the total voltage multiplied by the total

![20\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/198d16dcbfcf317b65fa326fcd0001a9.png)

**Answer:** The
![20\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/198d16dcbfcf317b65fa326fcd0001a9.png)
has the full 0.69Amps running through it because it is part of the ‘main
river’ (this is not the case for the other resistors because the current
splits). ![P\_{20 \\Omega} = I\^2\_{20 \\Omega} R\_{20 \\Omega} =
(0.69A)\^2 (20 \\Omega) =
9.5W](ck12_math_images_dir/0fd23838df59258083a51723197828fa.png)

**Question:** If these resistors are light bulbs, order them from
brightest to least bright.

**Answer:** The brightness of a light bulb is directly given by the
power dissipated. So we could go through each resistor as we did the
![20\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/198d16dcbfcf317b65fa326fcd0001a9.png)
guy and calculate the power then simply order them. But, we can also
think it out. For the guys in parallel the current splits with most of
the current going through the
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
path (less resistance) and less going through the
![90\\Omega+10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/9006fb5ffbc878c99c38be6f0887e8e8.png)
path. Well the second path is ten times the resistance of the first, so
it will have one tenth of the total current. Thus, there is
approximately and 0.069 Amps going through the
![90\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/6f22a5a29f6b22aad5ab676b357a21e5.png)
and
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
path and 0.621Amps going through the
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
path.

![P\_{10 \\Omega} &= I\^2\_{10\\Omega}R\_{10
\\Omega}=(0.621A)\^2(10\\Omega)=3.8W\\\\P\_{90+10\\Omega} &=
I\^2\_{90+10\\Omega}R\_{90 + 10
\\Omega}=(0.069A)\^2(100\\Omega)=0.5W](ck12_math_images_dir/f08cdbebcfccdab5dbb00dfc786a215b.png)

We now know that the
![20\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/198d16dcbfcf317b65fa326fcd0001a9.png)
is the brightest,
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
is second and then the
![90\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/6f22a5a29f6b22aad5ab676b357a21e5.png)
and last the
![10\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/4fde7e754c1aa84f49b41ec4e5bf5f17.png)
(-these last two have same current flowing through them, so
![90\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/6f22a5a29f6b22aad5ab676b357a21e5.png)
is brighter due to its higher resistance).

![\^\*](ck12_math_images_dir/7b4df4c53501bd92171b7de0a5ab4eff.png) Note:
Adding up these two plus the 9.5W from the
![20\\Omega](ck12_math_images_dir/198d16dcbfcf317b65fa326fcd0001a9.png)
resistor gives us 13.8W, which is the total power previously calculated,
so we have confidence everything is good.
