# Forewor {#1.html#x-ck12-Rm9yZXdvcg..-chapter}

The study of physical science is an exploration of chemistry, physics,
and the Earth. The CK-12 Physical Science Concept Collection presents
physical science as a set of 5 chapters, each centered around a general
subject area, such as the study of chemical interactions. Each chapter
is broken down into concepts. Each concept is a mini-lesson that
addresses one specific topic or key objective. The complete CK-12
Physical Science Concept Collection is comprised of 297 concepts.

Are you curious about other planets? Did you ever wish you could explore
them like the Mars rover in this picture? If so, then you’re thinking
like a scientist. Scientists are curious about things in nature, and
they do investigations to better understand them. They often use
technology—from microscopes to Mars rovers—to extend their own senses so
they can learn even more. In this unit, you’ll read about how scientists
think and how they investigate and explore the natural world.

Does the word *science* make you think of high-tech labs and researchers
in white coats like the ones in this picture? This is often an accurate
image of science but not always. If you look up science in a dictionary,
you would find that it comes from a Latin word that means “having
knowledge.” However, this isn’t an adequate definition either.

### What Is Science? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBTY2llbmNlPw..-gx0}

Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having
knowledge. **Science** is a way of learning about the natural world that
is based on evidence and logic. In other words, science is a process,
not just a body of facts. Through the process of science, our knowledge
of the world advances.

### The Goal of Science {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdvYWwgb2YgU2NpZW5jZQ..-9vw}

Scientists may focus on very different aspects of the natural world. For
example, some scientists focus on the world of tiny objects, such as
atoms and molecules. Other scientists devote their attention to huge
objects, such as the sun and other stars. But all scientists have at
least one thing in common. They want to understand how and why things
happen. Achieving this understanding is the goal of science.

Have you ever experienced the thrill of an exciting fireworks show like
the one pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMS0wMS1GaXJld29yaw..) ? Fireworks
show how the goal of science leads to discovery. Fireworks were invented
at least 2000 years ago in China, but explaining how and why they work
didn’t happen until much later. It wasn’t until scientists had learned
about elements and chemical reactions that they could explain what
caused fireworks to create brilliant bursts of light and deep rumbling
booms.

how and why they explode.

### How Science Advances {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNjaWVuY2UgQWR2YW5jZXM.-lao}

Sometimes learning about science is frustrating because scientific
knowledge is always changing. But that’s also what makes science
exciting. Occasionally, science moves forward in giant steps. More
commonly, however, science advances in baby steps.

Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new
idea. For example, in 1666, Isaac Newton introduced the idea that
gravity is universal. People had long known that things fall to the
ground because they are attracted by Earth. But Newton proposed that
everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything
else. This idea is known as Newton’s law of universal gravitation.

**Q:** How do you think Newton’s law of universal gravitation might have
influenced the advancement of science?

**A:** Newton’s law allowed scientists to understand many different
phenomena. It explains not only why things always fall down toward the
ground or roll downhill. It also explains the motion of many other
objects. For example, it explains why planets orbit the sun. The idea of
universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planets Neptune
and Pluto. The caption and diagram in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMS0wMi1Tb2xhci1zeXN0ZW0.) explain
how.

**Figure 2.2**

In the early 1800s, astronomers noticed a wobble in Uranus’ orbit around
the sun. They predicted that the wobble was caused by the pull of
gravity of another, not-yet-discovered planet. Scientists searched the
skies for the “missing” planet. When they discovered Neptune in 1846,
they thought they had found their missing planet. After the astronomers
took into account the effects of Neptune’s gravity, they saw that Uranus
still had an unexplained wobble. They predicted that there must be
another planet beyond Neptune. That planet, now called Pluto, was
finally discovered in 1930. Of special note, as of 2006, the
International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted Pluto from its planet
status as it does not meet one of the criteria for planetary standards.
For more information see:
[http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060821/full/news060821-11.html](news060821-11.html)

</div>

Baby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually
accumulate. The accumulating evidence lets scientists refine and expand
on earlier ideas. For example, the scientific idea of the atom was
introduced in the early 1800s. But scientists came to understand the
structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two
centuries. Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand
today.

The advancement of science is sometimes a very bumpy road. New knowledge
and ideas aren’t always accepted at first, and scientists may be mocked
for their ideas. The idea that Earth’s continents drift on the planet’s
surface is a good example. This idea was first proposed by a scientist
named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s. Wegener also proposed that all
of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent, which he
named Pangaea (see **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMS0wMy1QYW5nYWVh) ). Other
scientists not only rejected Wegener’s ideas, but ridiculed Wegener for
even suggesting them. It wasn’t until the 1950s that enough evidence had
accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right.
Unfortunately, Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas
accepted.

**Figure 2.3**

This map shows the supercontinent Pangaea, which was first proposed by
Alfred Wegener. Pangaea included all of the separate continents we know
today. Scientists now know that the individual continents drifted apart
to their present locations over millions of years.

</div>

**Q:** What types of evidence might support Wegener’s ideas?

**A:** Several types of evidence support Wegener’s ideas. For example,
similar fossils and rock formations have been found on continents that
are now separated by oceans. It is also now known that Earth’s crust
consists of rigid plates that slide over molten rock below them. This
explains how continents can drift. Even the shapes of today’s continents
show how they once fit together, like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle.

The man in this photo is a police detective. He’s examining and
gathering clues that may help solve a crime. Based on all of the clues
he finds, he may be able to conclude who committed the crime. Doing
science is similar to solving crimes. It also involves gathering
evidence and drawing conclusions. Both solving crimes and doing science
use inductive reasoning.

### What Is Inductive Reasoning? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBJbmR1Y3RpdmUgUmVhc29uaW5nPw.._1-2kd}

**Inductive reasoning** is the process of drawing general conclusions
based on many clues, or pieces of evidence. Many crimes are solved using
inductive reasoning. It is also the hallmark of science and the basis of
the scientific method.

**Q:** How might the police detective pictured above use inductive
reasoning to solve the crime?

**A:** The detective might gather clues that provide evidence about the
identity of the person who committed the crime. For example, he might
find fingerprints or other evidence left behind by the perpetrator. The
detective might eventually find enough clues to be able to conclude the
identity of the most likely suspect.

### Inductive Reasoning in Science {#2.html#x-ck12-SW5kdWN0aXZlIFJlYXNvbmluZyBpbiBTY2llbmNl_1-nom}

A simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works
in science. Suppose you grew up on a planet named Quim, where there is
no gravity. In fact, assume you’ve never even heard of gravity. You
travel to Earth (on a student exchange program) and immediately notice
things are very different here than on your home planet. For one thing,
when you step out of your spacecraft, you fall directly to the ground.
Then, when you let go of your communications device, it falls to the
ground as well. On Quim, nothing ever falls to the ground. For example,
if you had let go of your communications device back home, it would have
just stayed in place by your upper appendage. You notice that everything
you let go of falls to the ground. Using inductive reasoning, you
conclude that all objects fall to the ground on Earth.

Then, you make the observation pictured ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wMi1CYWxsb29ucw..) ). You see
round objects rising up into the sky, rather than falling toward the
ground as you expect. Clearly, your first conclusion—although based on
many pieces of evidence—is incorrect. You need to gather more evidence
to come to a conclusion that explains all of your observations.

Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth.

</div>

**Q:** What conclusion might you draw based on the additional evidence
of the balloons rising instead of falling?

**A:** With this and other evidence, you might conclude that objects
heavier than air fall to the ground but objects lighter than air do not.

### Limits on Inductive Reasoning {#2.html#x-ck12-TGltaXRzIG9uIEluZHVjdGl2ZSBSZWFzb25pbmc._1-kfm}

Inductive reasoning can’t solve a crime or arrive at the correct
scientific conclusion with 100 percent certainty. It’s always possible
that some piece of evidence remains to be found that would disprove the
conclusion. That’s why jurors in a trial are told to decide whether the
defendant is guilty “without a *reasonable* doubt”—not without a shred
of doubt. Similarly, a scientific theory is never really proven
conclusively to be true. However, it can be supported by so much
evidence that it is accepted “without a reasonable doubt.”

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-chy}

-   Inductive reasoning is the process of drawing general conclusions
    based on many pieces of evidence. This type of reasoning is the
    basis of the scientific method.
-   In science, inductive reasoning is used to draw general conclusions
    from evidence. The conclusions are changed if necessary to explain
    new evidence as it becomes available.
-   Inductive reasoning cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true,
    but it may lead to conclusions that are very likely to be true.

### Explore More {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhwbG9yZSBNb3Jl_1-ilw}

Deductive reasoning is another type of reasoning. You can think of
deductive reasoning as inductive reasoning in reverse. With deductive
reasoning, you draw specific conclusions based on general statements
that are assumed to be true. At the URL below, read the short article

This photo shows a girl and her parents. They are having a discussion.
As you can see, the girl is rolling her eyes. What do you think her
parents may have said that caused this reaction? Could it be they have
just grounded her for some reason? That’s certainly one possibility, but
without any other information to go on, it’s “just a theory.” In other
words, it’s just a hunch or a guess. Theories are very important in
science, but in science a theory is never a hunch or a guess. It is much
more than that.    

### Not “Just a Theory” {#2.html#x-ck12-Tm90IOKAnEp1c3QgYSBUaGVvcnnigJ0._2-1wd}

The term *theory* is used differently in science than it is used in
everyday language. A **scientific theory** is a broad explanation that
is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence.
Because it is so well supported, a scientific theory has a very good
chance of being a correct explanation for events in nature. Because it
is a broad explanation, it can explain many observations and pieces of
evidence. In other words, it can help connect and make sense of many
phenomena in the natural world.

### Examples of Theories in Physical Science {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgVGhlb3JpZXMgaW4gUGh5c2ljYWwgU2NpZW5jZQ.._2-3uu}

A number of theories in science were first proposed many decades or even
centuries ago, but they have withstood the test of time. An example of a
physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is
Dalton’s atomic theory. John Dalton was a British chemist who lived in
the late 1700s and early 1800s. Around 1800, he published his atomic
theory, which is one of the most important theories in science.
According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all substances consist of tiny
particles called atoms. Furthermore, all the atoms of a given element
are identical, whereas the atoms of different elements are always
different. These parts of Dalton’s atomic theory are still accepted
today, although some other details of his theory have since been
disproven.

Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence. For example, he
studied many substances called compounds. These are substances that
consist of two or more different elements. Dalton determined that a
given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same
proportions, no matter how small the sample of the compound. This idea
is illustrated for the compound water in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMy0wMS1XYXRlci1tb2xlY3VsZQ..) .
Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of
tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific
proportions in any given compound.

**Figure 2.6**

Water is a compound that consists of the elements hydrogen (H) and
oxygen (O). Like other compounds, the smallest particles of water are
called molecules. Each molecule of water (H ~2~ O) contains two atoms of
hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.

</div>

**Q:** Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter.
Scientists now know that atoms are composed of even smaller particles.
Does this mean that the rest of Dalton’s atomic theory should be thrown
out?

**A:** The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesn’t mean that
we should scrap the entire theory. Atoms are still known to be the
smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements.
Also, it is atoms—not particles of atoms—that combine in fixed
proportions in compounds. Instead of throwing out Dalton’s theory,
scientists have refined and expanded on it.

There are many other important physical science theories. Here are three
more examples:

-   Einstein’s theory of gravity
-   Kinetic theory of matter
-   Wave-particle theory of light

### Keep It Simple {#2.html#x-ck12-S2VlcCBJdCBTaW1wbGU._2-hcn}

The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of
parsimony. The word *parsimony* means “thriftiness.” The law of
parsimony states that, when choosing between competing theories, you
should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions. In other
words, the simpler theory is more likely to be correct. For example, you
probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit
around the sun. But several centuries ago, it was believed that Earth is
at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around
Earth. While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according
to this theory, the explanation is unnecessarily complex.

**Q:** Why do you think parsimony is an important characteristic of
scientific theories?

**A:** The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific
theory, the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect. If
one assumption is wrong, so is the theory. Conversely, the theory that
makes the fewest assumptions, assuming it is well supported by evidence,
is most likely to be correct.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-pml}

-   A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted
    because it is supported by a great deal of evidence.
-   Examples of theories in physical science include Dalton’s atomic
    theory, Einstein’s theory of gravity, and the kinetic theory
    of matter.
-   The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law
    of parsimony. According to this law, the simplest of competing
    theories is most likely to be correct.

Did you ever drive a bumper car like the one pictured here? As you drive
around the track, other drivers try to bump into your car and push it
out of the way. When another car bumps into yours, both cars may bounce
back from the collision. The harder the two cars collide, the farther
back they bounce.

### It’s the Law {#2.html#x-ck12-SXTigJlzIHRoZSBMYXc._3-lan}

It may seem like common sense that bumper cars change their motion when
they collide. That’s because all objects behave this way - it’s the law!
A scientific law, called Newton’s third law of motion, states that for
every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Thus, when one
bumper car acts by ramming another, one or both cars react by pushing
apart.

**Q:** What are some other examples of Newton’s third law of motion?
What actions are always followed by reactions?

**A:** Other examples of actions and reactions include hitting a ball
with a bat and the ball bouncing back; and pushing a swing and the swing
moving away.

### Laws in Science {#2.html#x-ck12-TGF3cyBpbiBTY2llbmNl_3-xvw}

Newton’s third law of motion is just one of many scientific laws. A
**scientific law** is a statement describing what always happens under
certain conditions. Other examples of laws in physical science include:

-   Newton’s first law of motion
-   Newton’s second law of motion
-   Newton’s law of universal gravitation
-   Law of conservation of mass
-   Law of conservation of energy
-   Law of conservation of momentum

### Laws vs. Theories {#2.html#x-ck12-TGF3cyB2cy4gVGhlb3JpZXM._3-bic}

Scientific laws state *what* always happen. This can be very useful. It
can let you let you predict what will happen under certain
circumstances. For example, Newton’s third law tells you that the harder
you hit a softball with a bat, the faster and farther the ball will
travel away from the bat. However, scientific laws have a basic
limitation. They don’t explain *why* things happen. “Why” questions are
answered by scientific theories, not scientific laws.

**Q:** You know that the sun always sets in the west. This could be
expressed as a scientific law. Think of something else that always
happens in nature. How could you express it as a scientific law?

**A:** Something else that always happens in nature is water flowing
downhill rather than uphill. This could be expressed as the law, “When
water flows over a hill, it always flows from a higher to a lower
elevation.”

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-lyb}

-   A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under
    certain conditions. Newton’s three laws of motion are examples of
    laws in physical science.
-   A scientific law states what always happens but not why it happens.
    Scientific theories answer “why” questions.

Who is this man with the wild white hair? Could he be an aging rock
star? He’s not a famous musician, but he’s just as famous as many
celebrities. His name is Albert Einstein, and he’s arguably the most
important scientist of the 20th century. Einstein really shook up
science with his discoveries in the early 1900s. That may sound like a
long time ago, but in terms of the history of science, it’s as though it
were only yesterday.

### Evolution of Science {#2.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFNjaWVuY2U._4-lnu}

People have probably wondered about the natural world for as long as
there have been people. So it’s no surprise that science has roots that
go back thousands of years. Some of the earliest contributions to
science were made by Greek philosophers more than two thousand years
ago. It wasn’t until many centuries later, however, that the scientific
method and experimentation were introduced. The dawn of modern science
occurred even more recently. It is generally traced back to the
scientific revolution, which took place in Europe starting in the 1500s.

### In the Beginning {#2.html#x-ck12-SW4gdGhlIEJlZ2lubmluZw.._4-mb9}

A Greek philosopher named Thales, who lived around 600 BCE, has been
called the “father of science” for his ideas about the natural world. He
proposed that natural events such as lightning and earthquakes have
natural causes. Up until then, people understood such events to be the
acts of gods or other supernatural forces.

**Q:** Why was Thales’ idea about natural causes such an important
contribution to science?

**A:** Natural causes can be investigated and understood, whereas gods
or other supernatural causes are “above nature” and not suitable for
investigation.

Just a few hundred years after Thales, the Greek philosopher Aristotle
made a very important contribution to science. You can see what
Aristotle looked like in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wNS0wMS1BcmlzdG90bGU.) . Prior to
Aristotle, other philosophers believed that they could find the truth
about the natural world by inward reflection—in other words, just by
thinking about it. Aristotle, in contrast, thought that truth about the
natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive
reasoning. He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence
and logic. This idea is called empiricism, and it is the basis of
science today.

Aristotle introduced the idea of empiricism around 350 BCE. It is a
hallmark of modern science.

### Introducing the Scientific Method {#2.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgdGhlIFNjaWVudGlmaWMgTWV0aG9k_4-xje}

In the first 1000 years CE, Europe went through a period called the Dark
Ages. Science and learning in general were all but abandoned. However,
in other parts of the world science flourished. During this period, some
of the most important contributions to science were made by Persian
scholars. For example, during the 700s CE, a Persian scientist named
Geber introduced the scientific method and experimentation in chemistry.
His ideas and methods were later adopted by European chemists. Today,
Geber is known as the “father of chemistry.”

### Modern Western Science Emerges {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9kZXJuIFdlc3Rlcm4gU2NpZW5jZSBFbWVyZ2Vz_4-h0b}

Starting in the mid-1500s, a scientific revolution occurred in Europe.
This was the beginning of modern Western science. Many scientific
advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years.
The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first
convincing arguments that the sun—not Earth—is the center of what we now
call the solar system. (You can see both models of the solar system in
the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wNS0wMi1Tb2xhci1zeXN0ZW0tbW9kZWxz)
.) This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earth’s place in the
cosmos. Around 1600, the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the
telescope, which had just been invented, and made many important
discoveries in the field of astronomy. Some of Galileo’s observations
provided additional evidence for Copernicus’ sun-centered solar system.

**Figure 2.8**

The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system
before Copernicus introduced the model on the right.

</div>

**Q:** Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system were so influential that
the scientific revolution is sometimes called the “Copernican
revolution.” Why do you think Copernicus’ ideas led to a revolution in
science?

**A:** Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system are considered to be the
starting point of modern astronomy. They changed how all future
scientists interpreted observations in astronomy. They also led to a
flurry of new scientific investigation. Other contributions to science
that occurred during the scientific revolution include:

-   Kepler’s laws of planetary motion
-   Newton’s law of universal gravitation
-   Newton’s three laws of motion

### Einstein Rocks Science {#2.html#x-ck12-RWluc3RlaW4gUm9ja3MgU2NpZW5jZQ.._4-rsg}

Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein
(the “rock star” scientist pictured in the opening image). In 1916,
Einstein published his general theory of relativity. This theory relates
matter and energy. It also explains gravity as a property of space and
time (rather than a property of matter as Newton thought). Einstein’s
theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date,
whereas Newton’s law of gravity does not apply to all cases. Einstein’s
theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today.

**Q:** How might Einstein’s theory have influenced the course of
science?

**A:** Einstein’s theory suggested new areas of investigation. Many
predictions based on the theory were later found to be true. For
example, black holes in the universe were predicted by Einstein’s theory
and later confirmed by scientific evidence.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-k7g}

-   Science has roots that go back thousands of years to Greek
    philosophers including Thales and Aristotle.
-   The scientific method was introduced in the 700s by a Persian
    scientist named Geber.
-   Modern science began with the scientific revolution in Europe the
    1500s and 1600s. The scientific revolution was launched by
    Copernicus’ new ideas about the solar system.
-   In the early 1900s, Einstein rocked science with his theory of
    gravity, which explained the concept in an entirely new way.

This woman is playing a flute in what appears to be a cockpit. But why
are her feet strapped to the floor? And why is her hair standing on end?
The woman in the photo is astronaut Ellen Ochoa, Ph.D., and she’s
playing her flute aboard the space shuttle *Discovery* . The straps
prevent her from floating into the air in the zero-gravity ship. The
lack of gravity also explains her hairdo. In addition to being an
astronaut who has flown several space missions, Dr. Ochoa is a leading
research scientist and an inventor with several patents to her credit.

### Biases Against Women and People of Color {#2.html#x-ck12-Qmlhc2VzIEFnYWluc3QgV29tZW4gYW5kIFBlb3BsZSBvZiBDb2xvcg.._5-zf9}

Dr. Ochoa is one of just a few dozen female astronauts in the U.S. She
is also the first Hispanic woman in the world to go into space. Although
females make up more than half of the U.S. population, fewer than 25
percent of U.S. astronauts are women. Women are also under-represented
in science, especially physical sciences such as chemistry and physics.
What explains this?

Throughout history, women—and also people of color of both genders—have
rarely had the same chances as white males for education and careers in
science. Cultural, social, and economic biases have made it far harder
for them than for white males to excel in this area. This explains why
there have been fewer scientists among their ranks.

### Contributions of Women and People of Color {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJpYnV0aW9ucyBvZiBXb21lbiBhbmQgUGVvcGxlIG9mIENvbG9y_5-sai}

Believe it or not, the tree bark in this photo contains a revolutionary
anti-cancer drug. For almost a decade after the drug was discovered, the
trees, called Pacific yews, were stripped of their bark so chemists
could extract the drug for cancer patients. Stripping the bark harmed
the trees. This situation posed an ethical problem.

### What Is Ethics? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBFdGhpY3M__6-jxo}

**Ethics** refers to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong. Making
ethical decisions involves weighing right and wrong in order to make the
best choice. The ethical problem of the Pacific yew has both right and
wrong aspects. It’s right to save lives with the cancer drug that comes
from the tree bark, but it’s wrong to endanger the tree and risk its
extinction.

**Q:** What do you think is the most ethical decision about the Pacific
yew? Should the bark be used to make the drug and possibly save human
lives? Or should this be prohibited in order to protect the tree from
possible extinction?

**A:** This is tough ethical dilemma, and there is no right or wrong
answer. Ethical dilemmas such as this often spur scientists to come up
with new solutions to problems. That’s what happened in the case of the
Pacific yew. Scientists tackled and solved the problem of determining
the chemical structure of the anti-cancer drug so it could be
synthesized in labs. This is a win-win solution to the problem. The
synthetic drug is now available to save lives, and the trees are no
longer endangered by being stripped of their bark.

### Ethical Rules in Science {#2.html#x-ck12-RXRoaWNhbCBSdWxlcyBpbiBTY2llbmNl_6-o85}

Ethics is an important consideration in science. Scientific
investigations must be guided by what is right and what is wrong. That’s
where ethical rules come in. They help ensure that science is done
safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable. Here are some of the
ethical rules that scientists must follow:

-   Scientific research must be reported honestly. It is wrong and
    misleading to make up or change research results.
-   Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are.
    They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or hope
    to get.
-   Researchers must be careful. They should do whatever they can to
    avoid errors in their data.
-   Researchers must inform coworkers and members of the community about
    any risks of their research. They should do the research only if
    they have the consent of these groups.
-   Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely. They
    should provide for their needs and take pains to avoid harming them.
-   Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that
    they have the right to refuse to participate in the research. Human
    subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the
    research, including any potential risks. You can read about a
    terrible violation of this ethical rule in the **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wNy0wMS1UdXNrZWdlZS1zeXBoaWxpcy1leHBlcmltZW50) .

**Figure 2.9**

From the 1930s to 1970s, medical researchers (including the one pictured
here) studied the progression of a serious disease in hundreds of poor
men in Alabama. They told the men they were simply receiving free
medical care. They never told the men that they had the disease, nor
were the men treated for the disease when a cure was discovered in the
1940s. Instead, the study continued for another 25 years. It came to an
end only when a whistleblower made it a front-page story around the
nation.

</div>

### Science and Everyday Ethical Decisions {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW5jZSBhbmQgRXZlcnlkYXkgRXRoaWNhbCBEZWNpc2lvbnM._6-1fr}

Sometimes, science can help people make ethical decisions in their own
lives. For example, scientific evidence shows that certain human
actions—such as driving cars that burn gasoline—are contributing to
changes in Earth’s climate. This, in turn, is causing more severe
weather and the extinction of many species. A number of ethical
decisions might be influenced by this scientific knowledge.

**Q:** For example, should people avoid driving cars to work or school
because it contributes to climate change and the serious problems
associated with it? What if driving is the only way to get there? Can
you think of an ethical solution?

**A:** This example shows that ethical decisions may not be all or
nothing. For example, rather than driving alone, people might carpool
with others. This would reduce their impact on climate change. They
could also try to reduce their impact in other ways. For example, they
might turn down their thermostat in cold weather so their furnace burns
less fuel.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-yd9}

-   Ethics refers to deciding what’s right and what’s wrong.
-   Scientific investigations must be guided by ethical rules. The rules
    help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific
    knowledge is reliable.
-   Sometimes science can help people make ethical decisions in their
    own lives, but other factors usually must be considered as well.

Unless you’re a competitive swimmer like the athletes in the picture,
you probably don’t wear a full-body swimsuit. The swimsuit was designed
to help a swimmer glide smoothly through the water without restricting
body movements. The suit is made of two synthetic fibers: nylon, which
is very smooth, lightweight, and durable; and spandex, which is very
stretchy. This is just one example of the many ways that sports gear,
equipment, and performance have been improved by physical science.

### What Is Physical Science? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBQaHlzaWNhbCBTY2llbmNlPw.._7-crl}

**Physical science** is the study of matter and energy. That covers a
lot of territory because matter refers to all the “stuff” that exists in
the universe. It includes everything you can see and many things that
you cannot see, including the air around you. Energy is also universal.
It’s what gives matter the ability to move and change. Electricity,
heat, and light are some of the forms that energy can take.

### Chemistry and Physics {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWlzdHJ5IGFuZCBQaHlzaWNz_7-exo}

Physical science, in turn, can be divided into chemistry and physics.
Chemistry is the study of matter and energy at the scale of atoms and
molecules. For example, the synthetic fibers in the swimmer’s suit were
created in labs by chemists. Physics is the study of matter and energy
at all scales—from the tiniest particles of matter to the entire
universe. Knowledge of several important physics concepts—such as motion
and forces—contributed to the design of the swimmer’s suit.

**Q:** It’s not just athletes that depend on physical science. We all
do. What might be some ways that physical science influences our lives?

**A:** We depend on physical science for just about everything that
makes modern life possible. You couldn’t turn on a light, make a phone
call, or use a computer without centuries of discoveries in chemistry
and physics. The **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMV8xXzhfR0lBTlRT) show a variety of other
ways that people depend on physical science. Think about how knowledge
of energy and matter makes each action possible.

The Statue of Liberty, pictured above, is an icon of America and
freedom. The statue is made of steel and covered with a thin layer of
copper, the same type of matter that pennies are made of. Copper is a
brownish red metal, so why is the statue green? Chemistry, which is a
branch of physical science, has the answer.

### What Is Chemistry? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBDaGVtaXN0cnk__8-ctx}

**Chemistry** is the study of matter and energy and how they interact,
mainly at the level of atoms and molecules. Basic concepts in chemistry
include chemicals, which are specific types of matter, and chemical
reactions. In a chemical reaction, atoms or molecules of certain types
of matter combine chemically to form other types of matter. All chemical
reactions involve energy.

**Q:** How do you think chemistry explains why the copper on the Statue
of Liberty is green instead of brownish red?

**A:** The copper has become tarnished. The tarnish—also called
patina—is a compound called copper carbonate, which is green. Copper
carbonate forms when copper undergoes a chemical reaction with carbon
dioxide in moist air. The green patina that forms on copper actually
preserves the underlying metal. That’s why it’s not removed from the
statue. Some people also think that the patina looks attractive.

### Chemistry and You {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWlzdHJ5IGFuZCBZb3U._8-nob}

Chemistry can help you understand the world around you. Everything you
touch, taste, or smell is made of chemicals, and chemical reactions
underlie many common changes. For example, chemistry explains how food
cooks, why laundry detergent cleans your clothes, and why antacid
tablets relieve an upset stomach. Other examples are illustrated in the
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wOS0wMS1Db21wb3NpdGU.)
. Chemistry even explains you! Your body is made of chemicals, and
chemical changes constantly take place within it.

Did you ever look at your reflection in a funhouse mirror? That’s what
the person in this picture is doing. This type of mirror distorts your
features in silly ways. Do you know how a mirror like this one works?
Physics, which is a branch of physical science, can explain it.

### The Scope of Physics {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNjb3BlIG9mIFBoeXNpY3M._9-fhj}

**Physics** is the study of energy, matter, and their interactions. It’s
a very broad field because it is concerned with matter and energy at all
levels—from the most fundamental particles of matter to the entire
universe. Some people would even argue that physics is the study of
everything! Important concepts in physics include motion, forces such as
magnetism and gravity, and forms of energy such as light, sound, and
electrical energy.

**Q:** How do you think physics explains the distorted images formed by
a funhouse mirror?

**A:** Physics explains how energy interacts with matter. In this case,
for example, physics explains how visible light reflects from mirrors to
form images. Most mirrors, such as bathroom mirrors, have a flat
surface. Light reflected from a flat mirror forms an image that looks
the same as the object in front of it. Funhouse mirrors, like the one
pictured above, are different. They have a curved surface that reflects
light at different angles. This explains why the images they form are
distorted.

### Physics in the World Around You {#2.html#x-ck12-UGh5c2ljcyBpbiB0aGUgV29ybGQgQXJvdW5kIFlvdQ.._9-d2a}

Physics can help you understand just about everything in the world
around you. That’s because everything around you consists of matter and
energy. Several examples of matter and energy interacting are pictured
in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-UFMtMDEtMDEtMTAtMDItQ29tcG9zaXRl) . Read how
physics explains each example.

**Q:** Based on the examples in **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-UFMtMDEtMDEtMTAtMDItQ29tcG9zaXRl) , what might be
other examples of energy and matter interacting?

**A:** Like the strings of cello, anything that vibrates produces waves
of energy that travel through matter. For example, when you throw a
pebble into a pond, waves of energy travel from the pebble through the
water in all directions. Like an incandescent light bulb, anything that
glows consists of matter that produces light energy. For example,
fireflies use chemicals to produce light energy. Like a moving tennis
racket, anything that moves has energy because it is moving, including
your eyes as they read this sentence.

Imagine floating in space outside the International Space Station, like
the astronaut pictured here. What an exciting career! Did you ever want
to become an astronaut? A good place to start is by getting a degree in
physical science.

### Studying Physical Science {#2.html#x-ck12-U3R1ZHlpbmcgUGh5c2ljYWwgU2NpZW5jZQ.._10-712}

Physical science is the study of matter and energy. It includes the
sciences of chemistry and physics. Most careers in physical science
require a 4-year college degree in one of these fields. Some careers
require more advanced education as well. For example, an astronaut might
have a master’s degree or even a doctoral degree.

**Q:** Besides becoming an astronaut, a degree in physical science can
prepare you for many other careers. What careers do you think might be
available to people with degrees in physical science?

**A:** People with degrees in physical science might become pharmacists,
forensic technicians, or research scientists, to name just three
possible careers. Four additional careers in physical science are
described below.

### Careers in Chemistry and Physics {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FyZWVycyBpbiBDaGVtaXN0cnkgYW5kIFBoeXNpY3M._10-o71}

The odd-looking boat in this picture was made entirely from recycled
plastic bottles. That’s unusual enough, but how the boat was made is
even more unusual. Would you believe that it was created by a printer?
Of course, it wasn’t a printer like the one you might have on your desk
to print school papers. It was a special 3-D printer. This type of
printer forms an object, layer by layer, by spraying a fine powder of
plastic or metal instead of toner. It sprays the powder in a pattern
directed by a computer program. A laser beam melts the powder, which
then hardens. You can learn more about 3-D printing by watching the
video at this URL:

### What Is Technology? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBUZWNobm9sb2d5Pw.._11-mal}

Printers like the one that made the plastic bicycle are a new type of
technology. **Technology** is the application of science to solve
problems. Because technology finds solutions to practical problems, new
technologies may have major impacts on society, science, and industry.
For example, some people predict that 3-D printing will revolutionize
manufacturing.

**Q:** Making products with 3-D printers has several advantages over
making them with machines in factories. What do you think some of the
advantages might be?

**A:** Making products with 3-D printers would allow anyone anywhere to
make just about anything, provided they have the printer, powder, and
computer program. Suppose, for example, that you live in a remote
location and need a new part for your car. The solution? Just download
the design on your computer and print the part on your 3-D printer.
Manufacturing would no longer require specially designed machines in
factories that produce pollution. Another advantage of using 3-D
printers to make products is that no materials are wasted. This would
lower manufacturing costs as well as save natural resources.

### How Technology Evolves {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFRlY2hub2xvZ3kgRXZvbHZlcw.._11-0jd}

New technologies such as 3-D printers often evolve slowly as new
materials, designs, or processes are invented. Solar-powered cars are a
good example. For several decades, researchers have been working on
developing practical solar-powered cars. Why? Cars powered by sunlight
have at least two important advantages over gas-powered cars. The energy
they use is free and available almost everywhere, and they produce no
pollution. The timeline in **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-VGVjaFRpbWVsaW5l) shows some of the milestones in
the evolution of solar-powered cars.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Milestone                            
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------
  **1954: First modern solar cell**    The first modern solar cell was
                                       invented in 1954 by a team of
                                       researchers at Bell Labs in the U.S.
                                       It could convert light energy to
                                       enough electricity to power devices.

  **1955: First solar car**            In 1955, William G. Cobb of General
                                       Motors demonstrated his 15-inch-long
                                       “Sunmobile,” the world's first
                                       solar-powered automobile. Its tiny
                                       electric motor was powered by 12
                                       solar cells on top of the car.

  **1983: First practical solar car**  In 1983, the first drivable solar
                                       car was created by Hans Tholstrup, a
                                       Danish inventor who was influenced
                                       by the earlier Sunmobile. Called the
                                       “Quiet Achiever,” Tholstrup’s car
                                       was driven 4000 km across Australia.
                                       However, its average speed was only
                                       23 km/h, despite having more than
                                       700 solar cells on its top panel.

  **1987: First World Solar            Inspired by his success with the
  Challenge**                          Quiet Achiever, in 1987 Tholstrup
                                       launched the first World Solar
                                       Challenge. This was the world’s
                                       first solar car race. The race is
                                       now held every other year. In that
                                       first race, the winner was General
                                       Motors’ “Sunraycer,” shown here. It
                                       had an average speed of 67 km/h. Its
                                       aerodynamic shape helped it achieve
                                       that speed.

  **2008: First Commercial solar car** In 2008, the first commercial solar
                                       car was introduced. Called the
                                       Venturi Astrolab, it has a top speed
                                       of 120 km/h. To go this fast while
                                       using very little energy, it is
                                       built of ultra-light materials. Its
                                       oversized body protects the driver
                                       in case of collision and provides a
                                       lot of surface area for solar cells.

  :  Evolution of Solar-Powered Cars

**Q:** Why was the invention of the solar cell important to the
evolution of solar car technology?

**A:** The solar car could not exist without the solar cell. This
invention provided a way to convert light energy to electricity that
could be used to run a device such as a car.

**Q:** The 1955 “Sunmobile” was just a model car. It was too small for
people to drive. Why was it an important achievement in the evolution of
solar car technology?

**A:** The car wasn’t practical, but it was a working solar car. It
showed people that solar car technology is possible. It spurred others,
including Hans Tholstrup, to work on solar cars that people could
actually drive.

**Q:** How have the World Solar Challenge races influenced the
development of solar cars?

**A:** The races have drawn a lot of attention to solar car development.
The challenge of winning a race has also stimulated developers to keep
improving the performance of solar cars so they can go faster and
farther on solar power alone.

This giant six-limbed robot is NASA’s Tri-ATHLETE. As the robot’s name
suggests, it is very “athletic.” It was designed to do the heavy lifting
in explorations of other planets and moons in the universe. The *Tri*
(“three”) part of its name refers to the fact that the robot can split
into two separate three-limbed robots. These smaller robots can do
things that the larger, six-limbed robot can’t.

### What Is Technological Design? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBUZWNobm9sb2dpY2FsIERlc2lnbj8._12-lgz}

The process in which tri-ATHLETE was created and perfected is called
**technological design** . This is the process in which most new
technologies are developed. Technological design is similar to
scientific investigation. Both processes rely on evidence and reason,
and follow a logical sequence of steps to solve problems or answer
questions.

The process of designing a new technology includes much more than just
coming up with a good idea. Possible limitations, or constraints, on the
design must be taken into account. These might include factors such as
the cost or safety of the new product or process. Making and testing a
model of the design are also important. These steps ensure that the
design actually works to solve the problem. This process also gives the
designer a chance to find problems and modify the design if necessary.
No solution is perfect, but testing and refining a design assures that
the technology will provide a workable solution to the problem it is
intended to solve.

### Steps of the Technological Design Process {#2.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHMgb2YgdGhlIFRlY2hub2xvZ2ljYWwgRGVzaWduIFByb2Nlc3M._12-h3d}

The technological design process can be broken down into the series of
steps shown in the flowchart in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMV8xM19GbG93Y2hhcnQ.) . Typically, some
of the steps have to be repeated, and the steps may not always be done
in the sequence shown.

**Figure 2.14**

This flowchart illustrates the steps of the technological design
process.

</div>

Consider the problem of developing a solar-powered car. Many questions
would have to be researched in the design process. For example, what is
the best shape for gathering the sun’s rays? How will sunlight be
converted to useable energy to run the car? Will a back-up energy source
be needed? After researching the answers, possible designs are
developed. This generally takes imagination as well as sound reasoning.
Then a model must be designed and tested. This allows any problems with
the design to be worked out before a final design is selected and
produced.

**Q:** Assume you want to design a product that lets a person in a
wheelchair carry around small personal items so they are easy to access.
What questions might you research first?

**A:** You might research questions such as: What personal items are
people likely to need to carry with them? What types of carriers or
holders are there that might be modified for use by people in a
wheelchair? Where might a carrier be attached to a wheelchair or person
in a wheelchair without interfering with the operation of the chair or
hindering the person?

**Q:** Suppose you have come up with a possible solution to the problem
described in the previous question. How might you make a model of your
idea? How could you test your model?

**A:** First, you might make a sketch of your idea. Then you could make
an inexpensive model using simple materials such as cardboard,
newspaper, tape, or string. You could test your model by trying to carry
several personal items in it while maneuvering around a room in a
wheelchair. You would also want to make sure that you could do things
like open doors, turn on light switches, and get in and out of the chair
without the carrier getting in the way.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-dzy}

-   Technological design is the process in which new technology
    is developed.
-   Steps of the technological design process include: identify a
    problem, research the problem, generate possible solutions, select
    the best solution, create a model, test the model, refine and retest
    the model as needed, and communicate the final solution.

Look at the colorful kites in this picture. Did you ever fly a kite? Do
you think you could make one? What shape would you make it? What
materials would you use? How would you design it?

### Constraints on Design {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29uc3RyYWludHMgb24gRGVzaWdu_13-3r5}

The development of new technology—whether it’s a simple kite or a
complex machine—is called technological design. The technological design
process is a step-by-step approach to finding a solution to a problem.
Often, the main challenge in technological design is finding a solution
that works within the constraints, or limits, on the design. All
technological designs have constraints.

**Q:** Assume you want to design a kite. What might be some constraints
on your design?

**A:** Possible constraints might include the shape and size of the kite
and the materials you use to make it.

### Physical and Social Constraints {#2.html#x-ck12-UGh5c2ljYWwgYW5kIFNvY2lhbCBDb25zdHJhaW50cw.._13-cgh}

Technological design constraints may be physical or social.

-   Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and
    properties of materials. A kite, for example, will fly only if its
    shape allows air currents to lift it. Otherwise, gravity will keep
    it on the ground.
-   Social design constraints include factors such as ease of use,
    safety, attractiveness, and cost. For example, a kite string should
    be easy to unwind as the wind carries the kite higher.

### Weighing the Options {#2.html#x-ck12-V2VpZ2hpbmcgdGhlIE9wdGlvbnM._13-m4g}

All technological designs have trade-offs because no design is perfect.
For example, a design might be very good at solving a problem, but it
might be too expensive to be practical. Or a design might be very
attractive, but it might not be safe to use. Choosing the best design
often involves weighing the pros and cons of different options and
deciding which ones are most important.

**Q:** What trade-offs might there be on the design of a kite?

**A:** You might want to make a big kite, but if it’s too big it might
be too heavy. Then it would fly only on very windy days. Or you might
want to make a kite using a certain material that you really like, but
the material might cost more than you can afford to spend.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-ex3}

-   All technological designs have constraints, or limits, on
    the design.
-   Physical design constraints include factors such as natural laws and
    properties of materials. Social design constraints include factors
    such as ease of use, safety, attractiveness, and cost.
-   All technological designs have trade-offs because no design

This incredible image was made by the Hubble space telescope. The image
is called *Pillars of Creation* . It shows the actual formation of stars
in distant space. The Hubble telescope is a very powerful telescope that
orbits Earth like a satellite. Scientists placed the Hubble telescope
into space so it could make clear images like this without background
lights on Earth competing with the dim light from distant stars. It has
led to many scientific discoveries.

### How Technology and Science Are Related {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFRlY2hub2xvZ3kgYW5kIFNjaWVuY2UgQXJlIFJlbGF0ZWQ._14-ujh}

The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely
related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses
technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have
different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase
knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical
problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology
work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific
knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space
telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in
new ways.

### How Technology Revolutionized Science {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFRlY2hub2xvZ3kgUmV2b2x1dGlvbml6ZWQgU2NpZW5jZQ.._14-t2k}

The Hubble telescope was put into orbit around Earth in the 1990s, but
scientists have been using telescopes to make discoveries for hundreds
of years. The first telescope was invented in the early 1600s. The
inventor was probably a Dutch lens maker named Hans Lippershey. He and
his telescope are pictured in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0xNS0wMS1MaWJiZXJzaGV5LVRlbGVzY29wZQ..)
. Lippershey used scientific knowledge of the properties of light and
lenses to design his telescope.

telescope](ck12_2_files/20150911012228243008.jpeg "Hans Lippershey, the inventor of the telescope")

**Figure 2.15**

Hans Lippershey is credited with making the first practical telescope in
1608. He is pictured here using his invention to view distant objects.
Officials of the Dutch government recognized the importance of
Lippershey’s invention. They gave him a generous sum of money for his
design.

</div>

Lippershey’s new technology quickly spread all over Europe. Almost
immediately, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo started working
to improve Lippershey’s design. In just two years, Galileo had made a
more powerful telescope. It could make very distant objects visible to
the human eye. The **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0xNS0wMi1HYWxpbGVvLVRlbGVzY29wZQ..)
shows Galileo demonstrating his powerful telescope. It appears to be
focused on the moon. Galileo started using his telescope to explore the
night sky. He soon made some remarkable discoveries. He observed hills
and valleys on the moon and spots on the sun. He discovered that Jupiter
has moons and that the sun rotates on its axis. With his discoveries,
Galileo was able to prove that the sun, not Earth, is at the center of
the solar system. This discovery played an important role in the history
of science. It led to a scientific revolution that gave birth to modern
Western science. And it all began with technology!

together. Two are pictured in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0xNS0wMy1TZWlzbW9tZXRlci1zcGVjdHJvbWV0ZXI.)
. Another example is the microscope. It may have been invented by
Galileo around the same time as the telescope. Like the invention of the
telescope, the invention of the microscope also depended on scientific
knowledge of light and lenses.

**Q:** How do you think the invention of the microscope helped science
advance?

**A:** The microscope let scientists view a world of tiny objects they
had never seen before. It led to many important scientific discoveries,
including the discovery of cells, which are the basic building blocks of
all living things.

The Mars Rover pictured here is a wheeled robot developed by NASA. Its
job is to explore the surface of Mars. The rover contains a lot of
complex modern technology. But how it moves by rolling on wheels is a
very old invention. The wheel was probably invented many times in
different cultures, beginning at least 10,000 years ago. In addition to
wheeled carts and chariots, early wheels were used for water wheels,
grinding wheels, and wheels for spinning pottery. Wheels really changed
human life. They revolutionized transportation and made it much easier
to do many different kinds of work.  

### How Technology Affects Society {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFRlY2hub2xvZ3kgQWZmZWN0cyBTb2NpZXR5_15-c4w}

Important new technologies such as the wheel have had a big impact on
human society. Major advances in technology have influenced every aspect
of life, including transportation, food production, manufacturing,
communication, medicine, and the arts. That’s because technology has the
goal of solving human problems, so new technologies usually make life
better. They may make work easier, for example, or make people
healthier. Sometimes, however, new technologies affect people in
negative ways. For example, using a new product or process might cause
human health problems or pollute the environment.

**Q:** Can you think of a modern technology that has both positive and
negative effects on people?

**A:** Modern methods of transportation have both positive and negative
effects on people. They help people and goods move quickly all over the
world. However, most of them pollute the environment. For example,
gasoline-powered cars and trucks add many pollutants to the atmosphere.
The pollutants harm people’s health and contribute to global climate
change.

### Industrial Revolution {#2.html#x-ck12-SW5kdXN0cmlhbCBSZXZvbHV0aW9u_15-utt}

Few technologies have impacted society as greatly as the powerful steam
engine developed by Scottish inventor James Watt in 1775 (see **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0xNi0wMS1Nb2RlbC1zdGVhbS1lbmdpbmU.)
). Watt’s steam engine was soon being used to power all kinds of
machines. It started a revolution in industry. For the first time in
history, people did not have to rely on human or animal muscle, wind, or
water for power. With the steam engine to power machines, new factories
sprang up all over Britain.

The Industrial Revolution began in Britain the late 1700s. It eventually
spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and many other
countries. It marked a major turning point in human history. Almost
every aspect of daily life was influenced by it in some way. Average
income and population both began to grow faster than ever before. People
flocked to the new factories for jobs, and densely populated towns and
cities grew up around the factories. The new towns and cities were
crowded, and soot from the factories polluted the air. You can see an
example of this in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0xNi0wMi1Db3R0b25vcG9saXM.) . This
made living conditions very poor. Working conditions in the factories
were also bad, with long hours and the pace set by machines. Even young
children worked in the factories, damaging their health and giving them
little opportunity for education or play.

Manchester](ck12_2_files/20150911012228868546.jpeg "Polluting smokestacks in Manchester")

**Figure 2.19**

Dozens of factory smokestacks polluted the air in the English city of
Manchester in the 1800s.

</div>

**Q:** In addition to factory machines, the steam engine was used to
power farm machinery, trains, and ships. What effects might this have
had on people’s lives?

**A:** Farm machinery replaced human labor and allowed fewer people to
produce more food. This is why many rural people migrated to the new
towns and cities to look for work in factories. Steam-powered trains and
ships made it easier for people to migrate. Food and factory goods could
also be transported on steam-powered trains and ships, making them
available to far more people.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-nya}

Did you ever wonder who thinks up the designs for roller coasters like
this one, or how a roller coaster is built? There are more than 100
large amusement parks in the U.S., and they compete to have the fastest
or tallest coasters that give the most thrilling ride. Each year, many
of the parks install new roller coasters. Each new coaster is designed
for its specific location and the park’s needs. Then it is custom built.

### Technology Professionals {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVjaG5vbG9neSBQcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxz_16-nsb}

Companies that design and build roller coasters employ a range of
technology professionals. Technology is the application of science to
real-world problems. Professionals in technology are generally called
**engineers** . Engineers are creative problem solvers. They use math
and science to design and develop just about everything—from roller
coasters to video games.

**Q:** Whether engineers are designing and developing roller coasters or
video games, they need many of the same skills and the same basic
knowledge. What skills and knowledge do you think all engineers might
need?

**A:** All engineers need basic knowledge of math and science,
particularly physical science. For example, to design and build a roller
coaster, they would need to know about geometry, as well as forces and
motion, which are important topics in physical science. In addition, all
engineers must have skills such as logical thinking and creativity. The
ability to envision three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional
drawings is also helpful for most engineers.

### Careers in Engineering {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FyZWVycyBpbiBFbmdpbmVlcmluZw.._16-zib}

Different types of engineers, such as electrical and mechanical
engineers, must work together to build roller coasters and most other

Do you think that the man in this photo is a real scientist? In science
fiction, scientists may be portrayed as wild-eyed and zany, randomly
mixing chemicals in a lab. But that portrayal couldn’t be farther from
the truth. Real scientists are disciplined professionals, and scientific
investigations are very organized and methodical.

### Investigations in Science {#2.html#x-ck12-SW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbnMgaW4gU2NpZW5jZQ.._17-h1z}

Investigations are at the heart of science. They are how scientists add
to scientific knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world.
Scientific investigations produce evidence that helps answer questions.
Even if the evidence cannot provide answers, it may still be useful. It
may lead to new questions for investigation. As more knowledge is
discovered, science advances.  

### Steps of a Scientific Investigation {#2.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHMgb2YgYSBTY2llbnRpZmljIEludmVzdGlnYXRpb24._17-owh}

Scientists investigate the world in many ways. In different fields of
science, researchers may use different methods and be guided by
different theories and questions. However, most scientists follow the
general steps outlined in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wMS0wMS1TY2llbnRpZmljLW1ldGhvZA..)
. This approach is sometimes called the scientific method. Keep in mind
that the scientific method is a general approach and not a strict
sequence of steps. For example, scientists may follow the steps in a
different order. Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps.

### Using the Scientific Method: a Simple Example {#2.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgdGhlIFNjaWVudGlmaWMgTWV0aG9kOiBhIFNpbXBsZSBFeGFtcGxl_17-zeg}

A simple example will help you understand how the scientific method
works. While Cody eats a bowl of cereal ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wMS0wMi1Cb3ktZWF0LWNlcmVhbA..)
), he reads the ingredients list on the cereal box. He notices that the
cereal contains iron. Cody is studying magnets in school and knows that
magnets attract objects that contain iron. He wonders whether there is
enough iron in a flake of the cereal for it to be attracted by a strong
magnet. He thinks that the iron content is probably too low for this to
happen, even if he uses a strong magnet.

**Figure 2.22**

Cody makes an observation that raises a question. Curiosity about
observations is how most scientific investigations begin.

</div>

**Q:** If Cody were doing a scientific investigation, what would be his
question and hypothesis?

**A:** Cody’s question would be, “Is there enough iron in a flake of
cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet?” His hypothesis would
be, “The iron content of a flake of cereal is too low for it to be
attracted by a strong magnet.”

Cody decides to do an experiment to test his hypothesis. He gets a
strong magnet from his mom’s toolbox and places a dry flake of cereal on
the table. Then he slowly moves the magnet closer to the flake. To his
surprise, when the magnet gets very close to the flake, the flake moves
the rest of the way to the magnet.

**Q:** Based on this evidence, what should Cody conclude?

**A:** Cody should conclude that his hypothesis is incorrect. There is
enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong
magnet.

**Q:** If Cody were a scientist doing an actual scientific
investigation, what should he do next?

**A:** He should report his results to other scientists.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-yqi}

-   Investigations are at the heart of science. They produce evidence
    that helps scientists answer questions and better understand
    the world.
-   Most scientists follow the same general approach to investigation,
    which is called the scientific method. It includes the following
    steps: ask a question, do background research, construct a
    hypothesis, test the hypothesis by doing an experiment, analyze the
    data and draw a conclusion, and report the results.

A scientist observed this orange-colored scum on a pond in her
neighborhood. She wondered what the scum is and why it was there. She
decided to do an investigation to find answers to her questions.
Scientific investigations often result when observations like this raise
questions.

### What Are Observations? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgT2JzZXJ2YXRpb25zPw.._18-kjk}

An **observation** is any information that is gathered with the senses.
Our senses include vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. We see with
our eyes, hear with our ears, touch with our hands, smell with our nose,
and taste with our tongue. We can also extend our senses and our ability
to make observations by using instruments such as microscopes,
telescopes, and thermometers.

**Q:** How do these instruments extend human senses and our ability to
make observations?

**A:** Microscopes and telescopes extend the sense of vision. They allow
us to observe objects that are too small (microscopes) or too distant
(telescopes) for the unaided eye to see. Thermometers extend the sense
of touch. Using our sense of touch, we can only feel how warm or cold
something is relative to our own temperature or the temperature of
something else. Thermometers allow us to measure precisely how warm or
cold something is.

### Using Observations to Gather Evidence {#2.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgT2JzZXJ2YXRpb25zIHRvIEdhdGhlciBFdmlkZW5jZQ.._18-fhs}

Besides raising questions for investigation, observations play another
role in scientific investigations. They help scientists gather evidence.
For example, to investigate whether a chemical change has occurred, a
scientist might observe whether certain telltale signs are present. In
some chemical changes, for example, a substance turns from one color to
another. You can see an example of this in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wMi0wMS1TdGFja3MtcGVubmllcw..)
. In other chemical changes, an odor is produced or gas bubbles are
released. All of these changes can be observed with the senses.

Some of these pennies are shiny and copper colored. That’s how pennies
look when they are new. The older pennies are dull and brown. Copper at
the surface of these pennies has combined with air to become a different
substance with different properties. The change in color shows that a
chemical change has occurred.

</div>

**Q:** Some chemical changes release heat. How could this change be
observed?

**A:** The sense of touch—or a thermometer—could be used to observe an
increase in temperature.

Although this cartoon pokes fun at scientific hypotheses, the concept of
hypothesis is one of the most important in science. Scientific
investigations discover evidence that helps science advance, and the
purpose of scientific investigations generally is to test hypotheses.
Finding evidence to support or disprove hypotheses is how science
advances.

### What Is a Scientific Hypothesis? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFNjaWVudGlmaWMgSHlwb3RoZXNpcz8._19-g9z}

The word *hypothesis* can be defined as an "educated guess." For
example, it might be an educated guess about why a natural event occurs.
But not all hypotheses—even those about the natural world—are scientific
hypotheses. What makes a statement a scientific hypothesis rather than
just an educated guess? A scientific **hypothesis** must meet two
criteria:

-   A scientific hypothesis must be testable.
-   A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable.

### A Scientific Hypothesis Must Be Testable {#2.html#x-ck12-QSBTY2llbnRpZmljIEh5cG90aGVzaXMgTXVzdCBCZSBUZXN0YWJsZQ.._19-sdx}

For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make
observations that agree or disagree with it. If a hypothesis cannot be
tested by making observations, it is not scientific. Consider this
statement:

> "There are invisible creatures all around us that we can never observe
> in any way."

This statement may or may not be true, but it is not a scientific
hypothesis. That’s because it can’t be tested. Given the nature of the
hypothesis, there are no observations a scientist could make to test
whether or not it is false.

### A Scientific Hypothesis Must Be Falsifiable {#2.html#x-ck12-QSBTY2llbnRpZmljIEh5cG90aGVzaXMgTXVzdCBCZSBGYWxzaWZpYWJsZQ.._19-hqp}

A hypothesis may be testable, but even that isn’t enough for it to be a
scientific hypothesis. In addition, it must be possible to show that the
hypothesis is false if it really is false. Consider this statement:

> “There are other planets in the universe where life exists.”

This statement is testable. If it is true, it is at least theoretically
possible to find evidence showing that it’s true. For example, a
spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report
back if it discovers an inhabited planet. If such a planet were found,
it would prove the statement is true. However, the statement isn’t a
scientific hypothesis. Why? If it is false, it’s not possible to show
that it’s false. The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet, but
that doesn't necessarily mean there isn’t one. Given the vastness of the
universe, we would never be able to check every planet for life!

### Both Testable and Falsifiable {#2.html#x-ck12-Qm90aCBUZXN0YWJsZSBhbmQgRmFsc2lmaWFibGU._19-hjz}

Let’s consider one last example, which is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wMy0wMS1GYWxsaW5nLW9iamVjdHM.)
:

> "Any two objects dropped at the same time from the same height will
> reach the ground at the same time (assuming the absence of air
> resistance)."

Is this statement testable? Yes. You could drop two objects at the same
time from the same height and observe when they reach the ground. Of
course, you would have to drop the objects in the absence of air to
prevent air resistance, but at least such a test is theoretically
possible. Is the statement falsifiable if it really is false? Again, the
answer is yes. You can easily test many combinations of two objects and
if any two objects do not reach the ground at the same time, then the
hypothesis is false. If a hypothesis really is false, it should be
relatively easy to disprove it.

**Figure 2.24**

Both the elephant and the boy are falling to the ground because of
gravity. The force of gravity (F ~grav~ ) is greater for the elephant
than it is for the boy because the elephant is much more massive.
Nonetheless, both of them will reach the ground at the same time
(assuming they fall from the same height at the same time and there is
no air resistance.)

</div>

### Can You Prove a Hypothesis Is True? {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FuIFlvdSBQcm92ZSBhIEh5cG90aGVzaXMgSXMgVHJ1ZT8._19-oq3}

If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false, it is
likely that this would be discovered sooner or later after enough
objects had been dropped. It takes just one exception to disprove a
hypothesis. But what if the hypothesis really is true? Can this be
demonstrated as well? No; it would require testing all possible
combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the
same time. This is impossible. New objects are being made all the time
that would have to be tested. It’s always possible an exception would be
found in the future to disprove the hypothesis. Although you can’t prove
conclusively that a hypothesis is true, the more evidence you gather in
support of it, the more likely it is to be true.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-tzl}

-   In science, a hypothesis is an educated guess that can be tested
    with observations and falsified if it really is false.
-   You cannot prove conclusively that most hypotheses are true because
    it’s generally impossible to examine all possible cases for
    exceptions that would disprove them.

It’s exciting to roll down a skateboarding ramp, especially if you’re
going fast. The steeper the ramp, the faster you’ll go. What else
besides the steepness of a ramp influences how fast an object goes down
it? You could do experiments to find out.

### What Is an Experiment? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFeHBlcmltZW50Pw.._20-d73}

An **experiment** is a controlled scientific study of specific
variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different values. For
example, the speed of an object down a ramp might be one variable, and
the steepness of the ramp might be another.

### Experimental Variables {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhwZXJpbWVudGFsIFZhcmlhYmxlcw.._20-wxu}

There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a manipulated
variable and a responding variable.

-   A **manipulated variable** is a variable that is changed by
    the researcher. A manipulated variable is also called an
    independent variable.
-   A **responding variable** is a variable that the researcher predicts
    will change if the manipulated variable changes. A responding
    variable is also called a dependent variable.

You can learn how to identify manipulated and responding variables in an
experiment by watching this video about bouncing balls:

**Q:** If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences the
speed of an object down a ramp, what would be the responding variable?
How could you measure it?

**A:** The responding variable would be the speed of the object. You
could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch. You could clock the time
it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp.
The less time it takes, the faster the average speed down the ramp.

**Q:** What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp?

**A:** Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the
object. An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness.
An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it moves—it
might roll or slide down the ramp. Either of these variables could be
manipulated by the researcher, so you could choose one of them for your
manipulated variable.

### Experimental Controls {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhwZXJpbWVudGFsIENvbnRyb2xz_20-yow}

Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment. You
choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable. You want to
measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to
reach the bottom of the ramp. You decide to test two blocks on two
ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block reaches the
bottom first. You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a
rough board for the other ramp. You raise the rough board higher so it
has a steeper slope (see sketch below). You let go of both blocks at the
same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope
reaches the bottom sooner. You’re surprised, because you expected the
block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012230253706.png) </span>

**Q:** What explains your result?

**A:** The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom
sooner if all else was equal. The problem is that all else was not
equal. The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness.
The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher
ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper.

This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments:
experimental controls. A **control** is a variable that must be held
constant so it won’t influence the outcome of an experiment. In the case
of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been
controlled by making each ramp out of the same material. For other
examples of controls in an experiment, watch the video at the URL below.
It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls.

Click on the image above for more content

**Q:** What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of
your ramp experiment? How could these other variables be controlled?

**A:** Other variables might include variables relating to the block.
For example, a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster
than a rougher block. You could control variables relating to the block
by using two identical blocks.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-0ys}

-   An experiment is a controlled scientific study of
    specific variables. A variable is a factor that can take on
    different values.
-   There must be at least two variables in any experiment: a
    manipulated variable and a responding variable.
-   A control is a variable that must be held constant so it won’t
    influence the outcome of an experiment.

The environmental chemist in this photo is “fishing” for a sample of
river water. He works for the US Environmental Protection Agency. He is
looking for evidence of pollution in the water.

### Doing Science in the Field {#2.html#x-ck12-RG9pbmcgU2NpZW5jZSBpbiB0aGUgRmllbGQ._21-q9v}

Although experiments are the “gold standard” for scientific
investigations, sometimes it’s not possible or desirable to do
experiments. Often it’s important to investigate a problem in the real
world instead of in a lab. An investigation that gathers evidence in the
real world—as the environmental chemist above is doing—is called a
**field study** .

**Q:** Why are field studies important for environmental scientists?

**A:** To learn about the environment, scientists need to take
measurements and make observations in the real world. This means
gathering evidence in field studies; collecting samples of water from a
river is one example of this method.

### Case Study: River Water Pollution {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FzZSBTdHVkeTogUml2ZXIgV2F0ZXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_21-atr}

The environmental scientist above will gather samples of river water in
several different locations. Then he will take the samples back to a lab
to analyze them. He will do tests to identify any pollutants in the
samples. Taking samples from different locations may help him identify
the source of any pollution he finds. Pollution can enter a river from a
single source, such as a waste water pipe from a factory. This is called
point-source pollution. Or pollution can enter a river in runoff
rainwater that picks up pollutants as it runs over the ground. This type
of pollution enters the river everywhere. This is called nonpoint-source
pollution.

**Q:** Assume that the river is polluted only by nonpoint-source
pollution. Describe how the samples of river water would compare in
terms of the pollutants they contain.

**A:** All of the samples would contain about the same amount and types
of pollutants.

**Q:** How might point-source pollution be identified?

**A:** Just one sample might be polluted. This would be the sample taken
at, or just downstream from, the single source of pollution.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-79x}

-   In a field study, a scientist gathers evidence in the real world
    instead of in a lab.
-   Field studies are needed to investigate the environment. An example
    of a field study is collecting samples of river water to test for
    evidence of pollution.

Did you ever participate in a science fair? If you did, then you
probably made a poster outlining what you did for your project and how
your project turned out. Scientists often share their research in the
same way. The picture above shows a poster session at a scientific
conference. Posters are a quick and graphic way to communicate about
research.

### Importance of Communication in Science {#2.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBDb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uIGluIFNjaWVuY2U._22-ihz}

The last step of most scientific investigations is reporting the
results. When scientists communicate their findings, they add to the
body of scientific knowledge, and that’s how science advances. Science
generally builds on previous knowledge, sometimes advancing in giant
steps but more often in baby steps. The brick building analogy in the
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wNi0wMS1Ccmlja2xheWVy) may
help you better understand why communication is important in science.

cooperation](ck12_2_files/20150911012230755167.jpeg "Brick building, representing scientific cooperation")

**Figure 2.25**

You can think of scientific knowledge as a brick building, and the work
of a single scientist as an individual brick. Considered by itself, the
work of a single scientist may not seem that important, yet it may be an
important piece of the overall structure. But unless a scientist
communicates research results, that single brick may never be added to
the building.

</div>

When scientists communicate about their research, they may also get
useful feedback from other scientists. For example, comments from other
scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret
their findings in a different way. Other scientists can also repeat the
research to see if they get the same results.

**Q:** Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an
investigation?

**A:** If an investigation is repeated and different results are
obtained, then it throws doubt on the original research. On the other
hand, if the same results are obtained, scientists can place more
confidence in them.

### How Scientists Communicate {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNjaWVudGlzdHMgQ29tbXVuaWNhdGU._22-utw}

The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that
scientists may communicate about their research. Some of the most common
ways scientists communicate are listed below.

-   Scientists may present papers about their research at
    scientific conferences. This is a good way to quickly reach an
    audience of other scientists who are most interested in the
    research topic.
-   Scientists may publish articles about their research in
    peer-reviewed science journals. Peer review means that the work is
    analyzed by peers, in other words, by other scientists. The articles
    are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the
    research is accurate and honest.
-   Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their
    findings relate to matters of public policy, such as
    environmental pollution.
-   Scientists may communicate about their research to the
    general public. For example, they might create a Web site about
    their research, blog about it, or write articles for newspapers
    or magazines.

**Q:** Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about
their research to the general public? Give an example.

**A:** Communicating to the general public might be important if the
research is directly related to people’s lives. For example, assume that
a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car
crashes. She might write a newspaper article to share the research
results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the
risk of crashes.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-fl1}

-   The last step of most scientific investigations is communicating the
    results of the research. When scientists share their findings, they
    add to the body of scientific knowledge. They may also get useful
    feedback from other scientists.
-   Scientists may communicate about their research in several ways,
    such as presenting posters or papers at scientific conferences and
    publishing articles in scientific journals.

Did a math teacher ever tell you to check your work? If you’re adding
numbers, that means repeating the calculation to see if you get the same
answer the second time. If you get the same result twice, then the
answer is probably correct. But if you get a different answer the second
time, at least one of the results must be incorrect. Then you have to
add the numbers a third time and hope that the third answer will agree
with one of the other two.

### Replication {#2.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24._23-rvd}

Scientists also have to “check their work.” The results of an
investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the
investigation is repeated—usually many times—and the same result is
always obtained. Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated
is called **replication** . If research results can be replicated, it
means they are more likely to be correct. Repeated replication of
investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory. On the other hand,
if results cannot be replicated they are likely to be incorrect.

### Why Replication Is Important in Science: An Example {#2.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFJlcGxpY2F0aW9uIElzIEltcG9ydGFudCBpbiBTY2llbmNlOiBBbiBFeGFtcGxl_23-rlj}

The following example shows why replication is important in science. In
1998, a British researcher published an article in a medical journal
reporting that he had found a link between a common childhood vaccine
and autism (see **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wNy0wMS1DaGlsZC1pbmplY3Rpb24.)
). According to the article, children in his study developed autism soon
after receiving the vaccine. Following publication of the article, many
parents refused to have their children vaccinated. Several epidemics
occurred as a result, and some children died of the diseases.

This child is receiving a vaccine.

</div>

Soon after the original study was published, other researchers tried to
replicate the research. However, it could not be replicated. No other
studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism. As a result,
scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect.
Eventually, investigators determined that the original study was a
fraud. They learned that its author had received a large amount of money
to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism, so he faked his
research results. If other scientists had not tried to replicate the
research, the truth might never have come out. You can read more about
this case at the URL below.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._23-5ly}

-   Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is
    called replication. If research results can be replicated, it means
    they are more likely to be correct.
-   Replication is important in science so scientists can “check their
    work.” The result of an investigation is not likely to be well

In 1999, NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter, pictured here, burned up as it
passed through Mars’ atmosphere. The satellite was programmed to orbit
Mars at high altitude and gather climate data. Instead, the Orbiter flew
too low and entered the red planet’s atmosphere. Why did the Orbiter fly
off course? The answer is human error. The flight system software on the
Orbiter was written using scientific units of measurement, but the
ground crew was entering data using common English units.

### SI Units {#2.html#x-ck12-U0kgVW5pdHM._24-2yh}

The example of the Mars Climate Orbiter shows the importance of using a
standard system of measurement in science and technology. The
measurement system used by most scientists and engineers is the
International System of Units, or **SI** . There are a total of seven
basic SI units, including units for length (meter) and mass (kilogram).
SI units are easy to use because they are based on the number 10. Basic
units are multiplied or divided by powers of ten to arrive at bigger or
smaller units. Prefixes are added to the names of the units to indicate
the powers of ten, as shown in the **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U0k.) .

  Prefix       Multiply Basic Unit ×   Basic Unit of Length = Meter (m)
  ------------ ----------------------- ----------------------------------
  kilo- (k)    1000                    kilometer (km) = 1000 m
  deci- (d)    0.1                     decimeter (dm) = 0.1 m
  centi- (c)   0.01                    centimeter (cm) = 0.01 m
  milli- (m)   0.001                   millimeter (mm) = 0.001 m
  micro- (µ)   0.000001                micrometer (µm) = 0.000001 m

**Q:** What is the name of the unit that is one-hundredth (0.01) of a
meter?

**A:** The name of this unit is the centimeter.

**Q:** What fraction of a meter is a decimeter?

**A:** A decimeter is one-tenth (0.1) of a meter.

The device pictured above is called a pH meter. It is a scientific
measuring device that measures the acidity of a liquid. Being able to
use scientific measuring devices such as this is an important science
skill. That’s because doing science typically involves making many
measurements. For example, if you do lab exercises in science, you might
measure an object’s length or mass, or you might find the volume of a
liquid. Scientists use sensitive measuring devices to make measurements
such as these. The measurements are usually made using SI units of
measurement.

### Measuring Length with a Metric Ruler {#2.html#x-ck12-TWVhc3VyaW5nIExlbmd0aCB3aXRoIGEgTWV0cmljIFJ1bGVy_25-tma}

You’ve probably been using a ruler to measure length since you were in
elementary school. But you may have made most of the measurements in
English units of length, such as inches and feet. In science, length is
most often measured in SI units, such as millimeters and centimeters.
Many rulers have both types of units, one on each edge. The ruler
pictured below has only SI units. It is shown here bigger than it really
is so it’s easier to see the small lines, which measure millimeters. The
large lines and numbers stand for centimeters. Count the number of small
lines from the left end of the ruler (0.0). You should count 10 lines
because there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter.

### Measuring Mass with a Balance {#2.html#x-ck12-TWVhc3VyaW5nIE1hc3Mgd2l0aCBhIEJhbGFuY2U._25-5vh}

Mass is the amount of matter in an object. Scientists often measure mass
with a balance. A type of balance called a triple beam balance is
pictured in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wOS0wMi1UcmlwbGUtYmVhbS1iYWxhbmNl)
. To use this type of balance, follow these steps:

1.  Place the object to be measured on the pan at the left side of
    the balance.
2.  Slide the movable masses to the right until the right end of the arm
    is level with the balance mark. Start by moving the larger masses
    and then fine tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses
    as needed.
3.  Read the three scales to determine the values of the masses that
    were moved to the right. Their combined mass is equal to the mass of
    the object.

**Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wOS0wMi1UcmlwbGUtYmVhbS1iYWxhbmNl)
. It allows you to read the scales. The middle scale, which measures the
largest movable mass, reads 300 grams. This is followed by the top
scale, which reads 30 grams. The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams.
Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is 335.1 grams (300 grams +
30 grams + 5.1 grams).

</div>

**Q:** What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure?

**A:** The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100
grams + 10 grams).

**Q:** What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure?

**A:** The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram.

To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like
the one in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0wOS0wNC1FbGVjdHJvbmljLWJhbGFuY2U.)
. This type of balance also makes it easier to make accurate
measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout. In the picture,
the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a
plastic weighing tray. The mass of the tray alone would have to be
measured first and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder
together. The difference between the two masses is the mass of the
powder alone.

### Measuring Volume with a Graduated Cylinder {#2.html#x-ck12-TWVhc3VyaW5nIFZvbHVtZSB3aXRoIGEgR3JhZHVhdGVkIEN5bGluZGVy_25-tqv}

At home, you might measure the volume of a liquid with a measuring cup.
In science, the volume of a liquid might be measured with a graduated
cylinder, like the one sketched below. The cylinder in the picture has a
scale in milliliters (mL), with a maximum volume of 100 mL. Follow these
steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid:

1.  Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding the liquid.
2.  After adding the liquid, move so your eyes are at the same level as
    the top of the liquid in the cylinder.
3.  Read the mark on the glass that is at the lowest point of the curved
    surface of the liquid. This is called the meniscus.

**Q:** What is the volume of the liquid in the graduated cylinder
pictured above?

**A:** The volume of the liquid is 67 mL.

**Q:** What would the measurement be if you read the highest point of
the curved surface of the liquid by mistake?

**A:** The measurement would be 68 mL.

Have you ever played golf, like the boy in this photo? Even if you
haven’t played golf before, you probably know that the goal of the game
is to hit the ball into a hole with the fewest strokes of the club. Golf
is a good way to understand two important concepts in scientific
measurement: accuracy and precision.

### Accuracy {#2.html#x-ck12-QWNjdXJhY3k._26-oun}

The **accuracy** of a measurement is how close the measurement is to the
true value. If you were to hit four different golf balls toward an
over-sized hole, all of them might land in the hole. These shots would
all be accurate because they all landed in the hole. This is illustrated
in the sketch below.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012232703324.png) </span>

### Precision {#2.html#x-ck12-UHJlY2lzaW9u_26-vxj}

As you can see from the sketch above, the four golf balls did not land
as close to one another as they could have. Each one landed in a
different part of the hole. Therefore, these shots are not very precise.
The **precision** of measurements is how close they are to each other.
If you make the same measurement twice, the answers are precise if they
are the same or at least very close to one another. The golf balls in
the sketch below landed quite close together in a cluster, so they would
be considered precise. However, they are all far from the hole, so they
are not accurate.

**Q:** If you were to hit four golf balls toward a hole and your shots
were both accurate and precise, where would the balls land?

**A:** All four golf balls would land in the hole (accurate) and also
very close to one another (precise).

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-gte}

-   Accuracy means making measurements that are close to the true value.
-   Precision means making measurements that are close in value to each
    other but not necessarily close to the true value.

This scientist is using a calculator. Doing science often requires
calculations. Converting units—say from inches to centimeters—is one
type of calculation that might be required. Calculations may also be
needed to find derived quantities.

### What Are Derived Quantities? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgRGVyaXZlZCBRdWFudGl0aWVzPw.._27-qmh}

Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more
measurements. Derived quantities cannot be measured directly. They can
only be computed. Many derived quantities are calculated in physical
science. Three examples are area, volume, and density.

### Calculating Area {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgQXJlYQ.._27-oxs}

The area of a surface is how much space it covers. It’s easy to
calculate the area of a surface if it has a regular shape, such as the
blue rectangle in the sketch below. You simply substitute measurements
of the surface into the correct formula. To find the area of a
rectangular surface, use this formula:

<dl id="x-ck12-ODRjNzBiMjBhOGRlNWFlNzFjMGRjYTcwMDE5N2ViYjI.-wo2">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ODRjNzBiMjBhOGRlNWFlNzFjMGRjYTcwMDE5N2ViYjI.-wzf">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ODRjNzBiMjBhOGRlNWFlNzFjMGRjYTcwMDE5N2ViYjI.-q13">
<dd>
Area (rectangular surface) = length × width (l × w)

</dd>
</dl>

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012233408181.png) </span>

**Q:** What is the area of the blue rectangle?

**A:** Substitute the values for the rectangle’s length and width into
the formula for area:

<dl id="x-ck12-MjFmYTQxNWUxYWJiMDliNDRjYjM3NjBkZGRhYmMwNjg.-dmf">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MjFmYTQxNWUxYWJiMDliNDRjYjM3NjBkZGRhYmMwNjg.-x4g">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MjFmYTQxNWUxYWJiMDliNDRjYjM3NjBkZGRhYmMwNjg.-rf0">
<dd>
Area = 9 cm × 5 cm = 45 cm ^2^

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** Can you use this formula to find the area of a square surface?

**A:** Yes, you can. A square has four sides that are all the same
length, so you would substitute the same value for both length and width
in the formula for the area of a rectangle.

### Calculating Volume {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgVm9sdW1l_27-lj5}

The volume of a solid object is how much space it takes up. It’s easy to
calculate the volume of a solid if it has a simple, regular shape, such
as the rectangular solid pictured in the sketch below. To find the
volume of a rectangular solid, use this formula:

<dl id="x-ck12-NDYxMTdiMmQ4YjAyMzhiZDQzMzk3YjdjMmIzYmE4NmY.-sb1">

**Q:** What is the volume of the blue rectangular solid?

**A:** Substitute the values for the rectangular solid’s length, width,
and height into the formula for volume:

<dl id="x-ck12-N2NkZWZjM2QyZWRjMTBjMzI0MmE2NDEyNTRmOGVkZjc.-iov">

<dd>
Volume = 10 cm × 3 cm × 5 cm = 150 cm ^3^

</dd>
</dl>

### Calculating Density {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgRGVuc2l0eQ.._27-nli}

Density is a quantity that expresses how much matter is packed into a
given space. The amount of matter is its mass, and the space it takes up
is its volume. To calculate the density of an object, then, you would
use this formula:

<dl id="x-ck12-vjx">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-iey">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-nd4">
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** The volume of the blue rectangular solid above is 150 cm ^3^ . If
it has a mass of 300 g, what is its density?

**A:** The density of the rectangular solid is:

<dl id="x-ck12-esd">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ms1">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-zea">
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** Suppose you have two boxes that are the same size but one box is
full of feathers and the other box is full of books. Which box has
greater density?

**A:** Both boxes have the same volume because they are the same size.
However, the books have greater mass than the feathers. Therefore, the
box of books has greater density.

### Units of Derived Quantities {#2.html#x-ck12-VW5pdHMgb2YgRGVyaXZlZCBRdWFudGl0aWVz_27-ec1}

A given derived quantity, such as area, is always expressed in the same
type of units. For example, area is always expressed in squared units,
such as cm ^2^ or m ^2^ . If you calculate area and your answer isn’t in
squared units, then you have made an error.

**Q:** What units are used to express volume?

**A:** Volume is expressed in cubed units, such as cm ^3^ or m ^3^ .

**Q:** A certain derived quantity is expressed in the units kg/m ^3^ .
Which derived quantity is it?

**A:** The derived quantity is density, which is mass (kg) divided by
volume (m ^3^ ).

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-gq2}

-   Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or
    more measurements. They include area, volume, and density.
-   The area of a rectangular surface is calculated as its length
    multiplied by its width.
-   The volume of a rectangular solid is calculated as the product of
    its length, width, and height.
-   The density of an object is calculated as its mass divided by
    its volume.
-   A given derived quantity is always expressed in the same type
    of units. For example, area is always expressed in squared units,
    such as cm ^2^ .

its width. The rectangle in question has a length of 6.9 m and a width
of 6.5 m, so he multiplies the two numbers on his calculator. The answer
he gets is 44.85 m ^2^ , which he records on his homework. To his
surprise, his teacher marks this answer wrong. The reason? The answer
has too many significant figures.  

### What Are Significant Figures? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgU2lnbmlmaWNhbnQgRmlndXJlcz8._28-pzg}

In any measurement, the number of **significant figures** is the number
of digits thought to be correct by the person doing the measuring. It
includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring device
plus one estimated digit.

Look at the sketch of a beaker below. How much blue liquid does the
beaker contain? The top of the liquid falls between the mark for 40 mL
and 50 mL, but it’s closer to 50 mL. A reasonable estimate is 47 mL. In
this measurement, the first digit (4) is known for certain and the
second digit (7) is an estimate, so the measurement has two significant
figures.

Now look at the graduated cylinder sketched below. How much blue liquid
does it contain? First, it’s important to note that you should read the
amount of liquid at the bottom of its curved surface. This falls about
half way between the mark for 36 mL and the mark for 37 mL, so a
reasonable estimate would be 36.5 mL.

**Q:** How many significant figures does this measurement have?

**A:** There are three significant figures in this measurement. You know
that the first two digits (3 and 6) are accurate. The third digit (5) is
an estimate.

### Rules for Counting Significant Figures {#2.html#x-ck12-UnVsZXMgZm9yIENvdW50aW5nIFNpZ25pZmljYW50IEZpZ3VyZXM._28-2ez}

The examples above show that it’s easy to count the number of
significant figures when you are making a measurement. But what if
someone else has made the measurement? How do you know which digits are
known for certain and which are estimated? How can you tell how many
significant figures there are in the measurement? There are several
rules for counting significant figures:

-   Leading zeros are never significant. For example, in the number
    006.1, only the 6 and 1 are significant.
-   Zeros within a number between nonzero digits are always significant.
    For example, in the number 106.1, the zero is significant, so this
    number has four significant figures.
-   Zeros that show only where the decimal point falls are
    not significant. For example, the number 470,000 has just two
    significant figures (4 and 7). The zeros just show that the 4
    represents hundreds of thousands and the 7 represents tens
    of thousands. Therefore, these zeros are not significant.
-   Trailing zeros that aren't needed to show where the decimal point
    falls are significant. For example, 4.00 has three
    significant figures.

**Q:** How many significant figures are there in each of these numbers:
20,080, 2.080, and 2000?

**A:** Both 20,080 and 2.080 contain four significant figures, but 2000
has just one significant figure.

### Determining Significant Figures in Calculations {#2.html#x-ck12-RGV0ZXJtaW5pbmcgU2lnbmlmaWNhbnQgRmlndXJlcyBpbiBDYWxjdWxhdGlvbnM._28-prn}

When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have more
significant figures than the measurement with the fewest significant
figures. This explains why the homework answer above is wrong. It has
more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest
significant figures. As another example, assume that you want to
calculate the volume of the block of wood shown below.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012233899733.png) </span>

The volume of the block is represented by the formula:

<dl id="x-ck12-NWVlNTRlMjUxYjFhOTg4MmUxMjNjOWY0MGY5YWZkMjQ.-pkc">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NWVlNTRlMjUxYjFhOTg4MmUxMjNjOWY0MGY5YWZkMjQ.-azi">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NWVlNTRlMjUxYjFhOTg4MmUxMjNjOWY0MGY5YWZkMjQ.-6q4">
<dd>
Volume = length × width × height

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Therefore, you would do the following calculation:

<dl id="x-ck12-YWY1YWZjMmU4MTU2ZjA5Yjc2NmM2NTFiYTI5ODcwZGY.-wkw">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YWY1YWZjMmU4MTU2ZjA5Yjc2NmM2NTFiYTI5ODcwZGY.-d8o">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YWY1YWZjMmU4MTU2ZjA5Yjc2NmM2NTFiYTI5ODcwZGY.-a1s">
<dd>
Volume = 1.2 cm × 1.0 cm × 1 cm = 1.2 cm ^3^

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** Does this answer have the correct number of significant figures?

**A:** No, it has too many significant figures. The correct answer is 1
cm ^3^ . That’s because the height of the block has just one significant
figure. Therefore, the answer can have only one significant figure.

### Rules for Rounding {#2.html#x-ck12-UnVsZXMgZm9yIFJvdW5kaW5n_28-ufe}

To get the correct answer in the volume calculation above, rounding was
necessary. Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped
to get the correct number of significant figures. In this example, the
answer was rounded down to a lower number (from 1.2 to 1). Sometimes the
answer is rounded up to a higher number. How do you know which way to
round? Follow these simple rules:

-   If the digit to be rounded (dropped) is less than 5, then
    round down. For example, when rounding 2.344 to three significant
    figures, round down to 2.34.
-   If the digit to be rounded is greater than 5, then round up. For
    example, when rounding 2.346 to three significant figures, round up
    to 2.35.
-   If the digit to be rounded is 5, round up if the digit before 5 is
    odd, and round down if digit before 5 is even. For example, when
    rounding 2.345 to three significant figures, round down to 2.34.
    This rule may seem arbitrary, but in a series of many calculations,
    any rounding errors should cancel each other out.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._28-xuc}

-   In any measurement, the number of significant figures is the number
    of digits thought to be correct by the person doing the measuring.
    It includes all digits that can be read directly from the measuring
    device plus one estimated digit.
-   To determine the number of significant figures in a measurement that
    someone else has made, follow the rules for counting
    significant figures.
-   When measurements are used in a calculation, the answer cannot have
    more significant figures than the measurement with the fewest
    significant figures.
-   Rounding is done when one or more ending digits are dropped to get
    the correct number of significant figures. Simple rules state when
    to round up and when to round down.

Most of the stars pictured in this view of the night sky are hundreds of
light years from Earth. A light year is the distance that light can
travel in a year, or about 6 trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles. As this
example shows, quantities in science may be very large. Many other
quantities in science are very small. Both very large and very small
numbers have many zeroes, so they are hard to read and write without
making mistakes. That’s where scientific notation comes in.  

### What Is Scientific Notation? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBTY2llbnRpZmljIE5vdGF0aW9uPw.._29-ifd}

**Scientific notation** is a way of writing very large or very small
numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written in this format:

![ a \\times
10\^b](ck12_math_images_dir/cc323295ec0bf8c92d02ec98a1853b4d.png)

The letter *a* stands for a decimal number, and the letter *b* stands
for an exponent, or power, of 10. For example, the number 300 is written
in scientific notation as 3.0 × 10 ^2^ . The number 0.03 is written as
3.0 × 10 ^-2^ . Do you need a review of exponents? If so, watch the
video at this URL:

### Using Scientific Notation {#2.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgU2NpZW50aWZpYyBOb3RhdGlvbg.._29-njd}

It’s easier to convert numbers to and from scientific notation than you
might think. Refer to the examples on the chalkboard in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0xMy0wMVNjaS1ub3RhdGlvbi1jaGFsa2JvYXJk)
as you read the following steps. Follow the steps in the sequence listed
here to convert a number to scientific notation. Follow the steps in the
reverse order to convert a number from scientific notation.

1.  Move the decimal point left or right until you reach the last
    nonzero digit. This new decimal number is *a* in *a* × 10 *^b^* .
2.  Count how many places you moved the decimal point in Step 1. This
    number is *b* in *a* × 10 *^b^* .
3.  Did you move the decimal point left (first example in the **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0xMy0wMVNjaS1ub3RhdGlvbi1jaGFsa2JvYXJk)
    )? If so, *b* is positive. Did you move the decimal point right
    (second example in the **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMS0wMi0xMy0wMVNjaS1ub3RhdGlvbi1jaGFsa2JvYXJk)
    )? If so, *b* is negative.

These two examples show how to convert large and small numbers to
scientific notation.

**Q:** Apply the steps above to write 450,000 in scientific notation.

**A:** The unwritten decimal point in this number follows the last zero.
Move the decimal point from this position to the left and stop just
before the last digit, giving you 4.5 for *a* . The decimal point was
moved five places to the left, so *b* is 5. In scientific notation the
number is 4.5 × 10 ^5^ .

**Q:** Apply the steps in reverse order to write the number that is
expressed as 7.2 × 10 ^4^ in scientific notation.

**A:** Add zeroes to 7.2 as you move the decimal point four places to
the right. This gives you the number 72,000.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-n0s}

-   Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small
    numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written in the format *a* ×
    10 *^b^* .
-   Changing numbers to or from scientific notation is easy to do by
    following three simple steps.

The girls in this picture vary in height. The shortest girl has a height
of 52 cm, and the tallest girl has a height of 64 cm. The other two
girls fall in between these two extremes. How could you describe the
heights of all four girls with a single number? How could express how
they vary in height with another number?

### Using Statistics to Describe a Sample {#2.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgU3RhdGlzdGljcyB0byBEZXNjcmliZSBhIFNhbXBsZQ.._30-fek}

The girls in the picture above make up a small sample—there are only
four of them. In scientific investigations, samples may include hundreds
or even thousands of people or other objects of study. Especially when
samples are very large, it’s important to be able to summarize their
overall characteristics with a few numbers. That’s where descriptive
statistics come in. Descriptive statistics are measures that show the
central tendency, or center, of a sample or the variation in a sample.  

### Describing the Center {#2.html#x-ck12-RGVzY3JpYmluZyB0aGUgQ2VudGVy_30-imr}

The central tendency of a sample can be represented by the mean, median,
or mode.

-   The **mean** is the average value. It is calculated by adding the
    individual measurements and dividing the sum by the total number
    of measurements.
-   The median is the middle value. To find the median, rank all the
    measurements from smallest to largest and then find the measurement
    that is in the middle.
-   The mode is the most common value. It is the value that occurs
    most often.

**Q:** A sample of five children have the following heights: 60 cm, 58
cm, 54 cm, 62 cm, and 58 cm. What are the mean, median, and mode of this
sample?

**A:** The mean is (60 cm + 58 cm + 54 cm + 62 cm + 58 cm) ÷ 5 = 58 cm.
The median and mode are both 58 cm as well. The mean, median, and mode
are not always the same, as they are for this sample. In fact, sometimes
these three statistics are very different from one another for the same
sample.

### Describing the Range {#2.html#x-ck12-RGVzY3JpYmluZyB0aGUgUmFuZ2U._30-j3v}

Many samples have a lot of variation in measurements. Variation can be
described with a statistic called the range. The **range** is the total
spread of values in a sample. It is calculated by subtracting the
smallest value from the largest value.

**Q:** What is the range of heights in the sample of children in the
previous question?

**A:** The range is 62 cm – 54 cm = 8 cm.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-6fo}

-   Descriptive statistics are measures that summarize the
    characteristics of a sample.

Tornadoes, like the one pictured here, are very powerful storms that can
cause incredible destruction. Their winds may exceed 300 miles per hour,
and they can completely level towns and neighborhoods in just minutes.
Because tornadoes can be so serious, they are closely monitored,
measured, and counted. As a result, there are a lot of data on
tornadoes. One way to present these data is with graphs.

### Using Graphs in Science {#2.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgR3JhcGhzIGluIFNjaWVuY2U._31-fzn}

Graphs are very useful tools in science. They can help you visualize a
set of data. With a graph, you can actually see what all the numbers in
a data table mean. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs,
circle graphs, and line graphs. Each type of graph is suitable for
showing a different type of data.  

### Bar Graphs {#2.html#x-ck12-QmFyIEdyYXBocw.._31-rs9}

The data in **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6VG9ybmFkb19jaXRpZXM.) shows the average
number of tornadoes per year for the ten U.S. cities that have the most
tornadoes. The data were averaged over the time period 1950–2007.

  Rank   City                       Average Number of Tornadoes(per 1000 Square Miles)
  ------ -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  1      Clearwater, FL             7.4
  2      Oklahoma City, OK          2.2
  3      Tampa-St. Petersburg, FL   2.1
  4      Houston, TX                2.1
  5      Tulsa, OK                  2.1
  6      New Orleans, LA            2.0
  7      Melbourne, FL              1.9
  8      Indianapolis, IN           1.7
  9      Fort Worth, TX             1.7
  10     Lubbock, TX                1.6

  :  Average Number of Tornadoes per Year (1950–2007) in U.S. Cities
  with the Greatest Number of Tornadoes

Bar graphs are especially useful for comparing values for different
things, such as the average numbers of tornadoes for different cities.
Therefore, a bar graph is a good choice for displaying the data in the
**Table** [above](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6VG9ybmFkb19jaXRpZXM.) . The bar
graph below shows one way that these data could be presented.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012234514113.png) </span>

**Q:** What do the two axes of this bar graph represent?

**A:** The x-axis represents cities, and the y-axis represents average
numbers of tornadoes.

**Q:** Could you switch what the axes represent? If so, how would the
bar graph look?

**A:** Yes; the x-axis could represent average numbers of tornadoes, and
the y-axis could represent cities. The bars of the graph would be
horizontal instead of vertical.

### Circle Graphs {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2lyY2xlIEdyYXBocw.._31-nqe}

The data in **Table** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-VG9ybmFkb19TdHJlbmd0aHM.)
shows the percent of all U.S. tornadoes by tornado strength for the
years 1986 to 1995. In this table, tornadoes are rated on a scale called
the F scale. On this scale, F0 tornadoes are the weakest and F5
tornadoes are the strongest.

  Tornado Scale(F-scale rating)   Percent of all U.S. Tornadoes
  ------------------------------- -------------------------------
  F0                              55.0%
  F1                              31.6%
  F2                              10.0%
  F3                              2.6%
  F4                              0.7%
  F5                              0.1%

  :  Percent of Tornadoes by Strength in the U.S. (1986–1995)

Circle graphs are used to show percents (or fractions) of a whole, such
as the percents of F0 to F5 tornadoes out of all tornadoes. Therefore, a
circle graph is a good choice for the data in the table. The circle
graph below displays these data.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012234609415.png) </span>

**Q:** What if the **Table**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-VG9ybmFkb19TdHJlbmd0aHM.) on tornado strength
listed the numbers of tornadoes rather than the percents of tornadoes?
Could a circle graph be used to display these data?

**A:** No, a circle graph can only be used to show percents (or
fractions) of a whole. However, the numbers could be used to calculate
percents, which could then be displayed in a circle graph. If you need a
refresher on percents and fractions, go to this URL:

.

### Line Graphs {#2.html#x-ck12-TGluZSBHcmFwaHM._31-ilw}

Consider the data in **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QXZlcmFnZV9Ub3JuYWRvZXNfcGVyX21vbnRo) . It lists
the number of tornadoes in the U.S. per month, averaged over the years
2009 to 2011.

  Month       Average Number of Tornadoes
  ----------- -----------------------------
  January     17
  February    33
  March       74
  April       371

  :  Average Number of Tornadoes in the U.S. per Month (2009–2011)

Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time, or time
trends in data, such as how the average number of tornadoes varies
throughout the year. Therefore, a line graph would be a good choice to
display the data in the **Table**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-QXZlcmFnZV9Ub3JuYWRvZXNfcGVyX21vbnRo) . The line
graph below shows one way this could be done.

**Q:** Based on the line graph above, describe the trend in tornado
numbers by month throughout the course of a year.

**A:** The number of tornadoes rises rapidly from a low in January to a
peak in April. This is followed by a relatively slow decline throughout
the rest of the year.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._31-1jt}

-   Graphs are very useful tools in science because they display
    data visually. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs,
    circle graphs, and line graphs. Each type of graph is suitable for a
    different type of data.
-   Bar graphs are suitable for comparing values for different things,
    such as the average numbers of tornadoes for different cities.
-   Circle graphs are used to show percents of a whole, such as the
    percent of all U.S. tornadoes with different strengths.
-   Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time,
    such as variation in the number of tornadoes by month throughout
    the year.

When you make a line graph, you need to locate x and y values on a set
of axes. This lets you plot the points that will be connected to create
the line. Do the frog-and-fly activity at the following URL. See how
many flies you can catch while you practice plotting points.

Did you ever read a road map like this one? Maybe not, but you’ve
probably made a sketch of a house or other object and played with toy
cars or dolls. What do all these activities have in common? They all
involve models.

### What Is a Model? {#2.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIE1vZGVsPw.._32-sr0}

A **model** is a representation of an object, system, or process. For
example, a road map is a representation of an actual system of roads on
the ground. Models are very useful in science. They provide a way to
investigate things that are too small, large, complex, or distant to
investigate directly. To be useful, a model must closely represent the
real thing in important ways, but it must be simpler and easier to
understand than the real thing.

**Q:** What might be examples of things that would be modeled in
physical science because they are difficult to investigate directly?

**A:** Examples include extremely small things such as atoms, very
distant objects such as stars, and complex systems such as the electric
grid that carries electricity throughout the country.

**Q:** What are ways that these things might be modeled?

**A:** Types of models include two-dimensional diagrams,
three-dimensional structures, mathematical formulas, and computer
simulations. Examples of simple two-dimensional models in physical
science are described below. You can see examples of other types of
physical science models at these URLs:

### Simple Models in Physical Science {#2.html#x-ck12-U2ltcGxlIE1vZGVscyBpbiBQaHlzaWNhbCBTY2llbmNl_32-8ly}

The diagram below is a simple two-dimensional model of a water molecule.
This is the smallest particle of water that still has the properties of
water. The model shows that each molecule of water consists of one atom
of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012235004284.png) </span>

**Q:** What else can you learn about water molecules from this model?

**A:** The model shows the number of atomic particles—protons, neutrons,
and electrons—in each type of atom. It also shows that each hydrogen
atom in a water molecule shares its electron with the oxygen atom.

**Q:** Do you think this water molecule model satisfies the criteria of
a useful model? In other words, does it represent a real water molecule
in important ways while being simpler and easier to understand than a
real water molecule?

**A:** The model shows the basic structure of a water molecule and how
the atoms in the molecule share electrons. These features of the water
molecule explain important properties of water. The model is also
simpler and easier to understand than a real water molecule. In a real
molecule, electrons spin around the nuclei at the center of the atoms in
a cloud, rather than in neat, circular orbits, as shown in the model.
The atoms of a real water molecule also contain even smaller particles
than protons, neutrons, and electrons. For many purposes, however, it’s
not necessary to represent these more complex features of a real water
molecule.

The diagram below shows another example of a simple model in physical
science. This diagram is a model of an electric circuit. It represents
the main parts of the circuit with simple symbols. Horizontal lines with
+ and – signs represent a battery. The parts labeled R ~1~ , R ~2~ , and
R ~3~ are devices that use electricity provided by the battery. For
example, these parts might be a series of three light bulbs.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012235221030.png) </span>

**Q:** In the electric circuit diagram, what do the black lines
connecting the battery and electric devices represent?

**A:** The black lines represent electric wires. The wires are necessary
to carry electric current from the battery to the electric devices and
back to the battery again.

**Q:** How is a circuit diagram simpler and easier to understand than an
actual electric circuit?

**A:** A circuit diagram shows only the parts of the circuit that carry
electric current, and it uses simple symbols to represent them.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._32-p3p}

-   A model is a representation of an object, system, or process that is

Research in physical science can be exciting, but it also has potential
dangers. For example, the field scientist in this photo is collecting
water samples from treatment ponds. There are many microorganisms in the
water that could make him sick. The water and shore can also be strewn
with dangerous objects such as sharp can lids and broken glass bottles
that could cause serious injury. Whether in the field or in the lab,
knowing how to stay safe in science is important.

### Safety Symbols {#2.html#x-ck12-U2FmZXR5IFN5bWJvbHM._33-smw}

Lab procedures and equipment may be labeled with safety symbols. These
symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Learn
the symbols so you will recognize the dangers. Then learn how to avoid
them. Many common safety symbols are shown below.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_2_files/20150911012235480107.png) </span>

**Q:** Do you know how you can avoid these hazards?

**A:** Wearing protective gear is one way to avoid many hazards in
science. For example, to avoid being burned by hot objects, use hot
mitts to protect your hands. To avoid eye hazards, such as harsh liquids
splashed into the eyes, wear safety goggles. You can learn more about
these and other lab hazards and how to avoid them at this URL:
[http://www.angelfire.com/va3/chemclass/safety.html](safety.html) .

### Safety Rules {#2.html#x-ck12-U2FmZXR5IFJ1bGVz_33-nmi}

Following basic safety rules is another important way to stay safe in
science. Safe practices help prevent accidents. Several lab safety rules
are listed below. Different rules may apply when you work in the field.
But in all cases, you should always follow your teacher’s instructions.

**Lab Safety Rules**

-   Wear long sleeves and shoes that completely cover your feet.
-   If your hair is long, tie it back or cover it with a hair net.
-   Protect your eyes, skin, and clothing by wearing safety goggles, an
    apron, and gloves.
-   Use hot mitts to handle hot objects.
-   Never work in the lab alone.
-   Never engage in horseplay in the lab.
-   Never eat or drink in the lab.
-   Never do experiments without your teacher’s approval.
-   Always add acid to water, never the other way around, and add the
    acid slowly to avoid splashing.
-   Take care to avoid knocking over Bunsen burners, and keep them away
    from flammable materials such as paper.
-   Use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smelling
    substances directly.
-   Never point the open end of a test tube toward anyone—including
    yourself!
-   Clean up any spills immediately.
-   Dispose of lab wastes according to your teacher’s instructions.
-   Wash glassware and counters when you finish your work.
-   Wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the lab.

### In Case of Accident {#2.html#x-ck12-SW4gQ2FzZSBvZiBBY2NpZGVudA.._33-kj2}

Even when you follow the rules, accidents can happen. Immediately alert
your teacher if an accident occurs. Report all accidents, whether or not
you think they are serious.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-eyu}

-   Lab safety symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or
    broken glass. Knowing the symbols allows you to recognize and avoid
    the dangers.
-   Following basic safety rules, such as wearing safety gear, helps
    prevent accidents in the lab and in the field.
-   All accidents should be reported immediately.

What do think this picture shows? Here’s a hint: This illustration
mimics a photo taken with a special microscope that makes images of
things that are extremely small. In fact, the gray spheres in the image
represent things so small that trillions of them would fit inside the
period at the end of this sentence. Each gray sphere is an atom of lead.
Do you know what atoms are? They are the basic building blocks of
matter. Matter, in turn, is all the “stuff” in the universe. In this
unit you will learn much more about matter—from things as simple as
atoms to as complex as you!

Can you guess what this colorful image shows? Believe it or not, it
actually depicts individual atoms of cesium (reddish-orange) on a
surface of gallium arsenide molecules (blue). The image was created with
an extremely powerful microscope, called a scanning tunneling
microscope. This is the only type of microscope that can make images of
things as small as atoms, the basic building blocks of matter.

### What’s the Matter? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgdGhlIE1hdHRlcj8.-rsd}

Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. Everything you
can see and touch is made of matter, including you! The only things that
aren’t matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. In science,
**matter** is defined as anything that has mass and volume. Mass and
volume measure different aspects of matter.

### Mass {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFzcw..-8qu}

**Mass** is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance or an
object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller
masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a
balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or
an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may
give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance
were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has
the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the
fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see,
however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that
the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less
than 1 kg.

**Q:** If the fruit were at a lower level than the iron object, what
would be the mass of the fruit?

**A:** The mass of the fruit would be greater than 1 kg.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_3_files/20150911012321878933.jpeg)
</span>

Mass is commonly confused with weight. The two are closely related, but
they measure different things. Whereas mass measures the amount of
matter in an object, weight measures the force of gravity acting on an
object. The force of gravity on an object depends on its mass but also
on the strength of gravity. If the strength of gravity is held constant
(as it is all over Earth), then an object with a greater mass also has a
greater weight.

**Q:** With Earth’s gravity, an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight
of 2.2 lb. How much does a 10 kg object weigh on Earth?

**A:** A 10 kg object weighs ten times as much as a 1 kg object:

10 × 2.2 lb = 22 lb

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
### Volume {#3.html#x-ck12-Vm9sdW1l-l6e}

**Volume** is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an
object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m ^3^
), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm ^3^ , and liquids may be
measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is
measured depends on its state.

-   The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such
    as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder.
-   The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases
    expand to fill whatever space is available to them.
-   The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from
    its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is
    the product of its length, width, and height.
-   The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by the

**Q:** How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room?

**A:** If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume
from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular room can
be calculated with the formula:

<dl id="x-ck12-YjQ2NGM1YzEyNzBlZTQzZjNlZTkzMzQ4ZjEwZDc3ODQ.-fkr">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YjQ2NGM1YzEyNzBlZTQzZjNlZTkzMzQ4ZjEwZDc3ODQ.-d29">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YjQ2NGM1YzEyNzBlZTQzZjNlZTkzMzQ4ZjEwZDc3ODQ.-bjs">
<dd>
Volume = length × width × height

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and
the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is:

<dl id="x-ck12-MzY2ODEwMWUzZmJkYmI5OTRlZmUxYmEwNDc5Y2U3ZWQ.-9ly">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MzY2ODEwMWUzZmJkYmI5OTRlZmUxYmEwNDc5Y2U3ZWQ.-xns">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MzY2ODEwMWUzZmJkYmI5OTRlZmUxYmEwNDc5Y2U3ZWQ.-agu">
<dd>
Volume = 5.0 m × 3.0 m × 2.5 m = 37.5 m ^3^

</dd>
</dl>

**Q:** What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above?

**A:** The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water
and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur
alone is 5.6 mL – 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-bxf}

-   Matter is all the “stuff” that exists in the universe. It has both
    mass and volume.
-   Mass measures the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The
    basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg).
-   Volume measures the amount of space that a substance or an object
    takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m ^3^ ).

Both of these people are participating in a board sport, but the man on
the left is snowboarding in Norway while the woman on the right is
sandboarding in Dubai. Snow and sand are both kinds of matter, but they
have different properties. What are some ways snow and sand differ? One
difference is the temperature at which they melt. Snow melts at 0°C,
whereas sand melts at about 1600°C! The temperature at which something
melts is its melting point. Melting point is just one of many physical
properties of matter.

### What Are Physical Properties? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgUGh5c2ljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcz8._1-xjy}

**Physical properties** of matter are properties that can be measured or
observed without matter changing to an entirely different substance.
Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your
senses. For example, they may be things that you can see, hear, smell,
or feel.

**Q:** What differences between snow and sand can you detect with your
senses?

**A:** You can see that snow and sand have a different color. You can
also feel that snow is softer than sand. Both color and hardness are
physical properties of matter.

### Additional Physical Properties {#3.html#x-ck12-QWRkaXRpb25hbCBQaHlzaWNhbCBQcm9wZXJ0aWVz_1-18e}

In addition to these properties, other physical properties of matter
include the state of matter. States of matter include liquid, solid, and
gaseous states. For example at 20°C, coal exists as a solid and water
exists as a liquid. Additional examples of physical properties include:

-   odor
-   boiling point
-   ability to conduct heat
-   ability to conduct electricity
-   ability to dissolve in other substances

Some of these properties are illustrated in the **Figures**

![Copper wires can conduct electricity
well](ck12_3_files/20150911012322865114.jpeg "Copper wires can conduct electricity well")

**Figure 3.4**

Copper is a good conductor of electricity. That's why electric wires are
often made of copper. They are covered with a protective coating of
plastic, which does not conduct electricity.

</div>

**Q:** The coolant that is added to a car radiator also has a lower
freezing point than water. Why is this physical property useful?

**A:** When coolant is added to water in a car radiator, it lowers the
freezing point of the water. This prevents the water in the radiator
from freezing when the temperature drops below 0°C, which is the
freezing point of pure water.

**Q:** Besides being able to conduct electricity, what other physical
property of copper makes it well suited for electric wires?

**A:** Copper, like other metals, is ductile. This means that it can be
rolled and stretched into long thin shapes such as wires.

The man in this cartoon is filling balloons with helium gas. What will
happen if he lets go of the filled balloons? They will rise up into the
air until they reach the ceiling. Do you know why? It’s because helium
has less density than air.

### Defining Density {#3.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgRGVuc2l0eQ.._2-ciy}

**Density** is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how
closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed
together more tightly, matter has greater density. Differences in
density of matter explain many phenomena, not just why helium balloons
rise. For example, differences in density of cool and warm ocean water
explain why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans.
You can see a colorful demonstration of substances with different
densities at this URL:

To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and volleyball,
pictured in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmFsbHM.) .
Imagine lifting each ball. The two balls are about the same size, but
the bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball. That’s because
the bowling ball is made of solid plastic, which contains a lot of
tightly packed particles of matter. The volleyball, in contrast, is full
of air, which contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. In
other words, the matter inside the bowling ball is denser than the
matter inside the volleyball.

A bowling ball is denser than a volleyball. Although both balls are
similar in size, the bowling ball feels much heavier than the
volleyball.

</div>

**Q:** If you ever went bowling, you may have noticed that some bowling
balls feel heavier than others even though they are the same size. How
can this be?

**A:** Bowling balls that feel lighter are made of matter that is less
dense.

### Calculating Density {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgRGVuc2l0eQ.._2-y2a}

The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space.
The amount of matter is measured by its mass, and the space matter takes
up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be
calculated with this formula:

![\\text{Density} =
\\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}}](ck12_math_images_dir/09fef6cb6260d14ca9756d1b69d3b68c.png)

Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of
1000 cm ^3^ . Then the density of the book is:

![\\text{Density} = \\frac{500 \\ \\text{g}}{1000 \\ \\text{cm}\^3} =
0.5 \\
\\text{g/cm}\^3](ck12_math_images_dir/d9a340c7e9a1314fc1b6ccaf5f63e498.png)

**Q:** What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a
mass of 300 g?

**A:** The density of the liquid is:

![\\text{Density} = \\frac{300 \\ \\text{g}}{30 \\ \\text{mL}} = 10 \\
\\text{g/mL}](ck12_math_images_dir/72b624d8c2f5ee73b5846a230e539c59.png)

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-2hu}

-   Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how
    closely packed the particles of matter are.
-   The density of matter can be calculated by dividing its mass by
    its volume.

Look at the two garden trowels pictured here. Both trowels were left
outside for several weeks. One tool became rusty, but the other did not.
The tool that rusted is made of iron, and the other tool is made of
aluminum. The ability to rust is a chemical property of iron but not
aluminum.

### What Are Chemical Properties? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQ2hlbWljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcz8._3-r2e}

**Chemical properties** are properties that can be measured or observed
only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different kind
of matter. For example, the ability of iron to rust can only be observed
when iron actually rusts. When it does, it combines with oxygen to
become a different substance called iron oxide. Iron is very hard and
silver in color, whereas iron oxide is flakey and reddish brown. Besides
the ability to rust, other chemical properties include reactivity and
flammability.

### Reactivity {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVhY3Rpdml0eQ.._3-zqc}

**Reactivity** is the ability of matter to combine chemically with other
substances. Some kinds of matter are extremely reactive; others are
extremely unreactive. For example, potassium is very reactive, even with
water. When a pea-sized piece of potassium is added to a small amount of
water, it reacts explosively. You can observe this reaction in the video
at the URL below. ( *Caution:* Don’t try this at home!) In contrast,
noble gases such as helium almost never react with any other substances.

### Flammability {#3.html#x-ck12-RmxhbW1hYmlsaXR5_3-jfm}

**Flammability** is the ability of matter to burn. When matter burns, it
combines with oxygen and changes to different substances. Wood is an
example of flammable matter, as seen in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmlyZQ..) .

</div>

**Q:** How can you tell that wood ashes are a different substance than
wood?

**A:** Ashes have different properties than wood. For example, ashes are
gray and powdery, whereas wood is brown and hard.

**Q:** What are some other substances that have the property of
flammability?

**A:** Substances called fuels have the property of flammability. They
include fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum, as well
as fuels made from petroleum, such as gasoline and kerosene. Substances
made of wood, such as paper and cardboard, are also flammable.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-yxe}

-   Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed
    only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different

As this mountain of trash suggests, there are many different kinds of
matter. In fact, there are millions of different kinds of matter in the
universe. Yet all kinds of matter actually consist of relatively few
pure substances.

### Pure Substances {#3.html#x-ck12-UHVyZSBTdWJzdGFuY2Vz_4-lx4}

A pure substance is called an **element** . An element is a pure
substance because it cannot be separated into any other substances.
Currently, 92 different elements are known to exist in nature, although
additional elements have been formed in labs. All matter consists of one
or more of these elements. Some elements are very common; others are
relatively rare. The most common element in the universe is hydrogen,
which is part of Earth’s atmosphere and a component of water. The most
common element in Earth’s atmosphere is nitrogen, and the most common
element in Earth’s crust is oxygen. Several other elements are described
in the musical video at this URL:

### Elemental Properties {#3.html#x-ck12-RWxlbWVudGFsIFByb3BlcnRpZXM._4-hrt}

Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from the
set of properties of any other element. For example, the element iron is
a solid that is attracted by a magnet and can be made into a magnet,
like the compass needle shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29tcGFzcw..) . The element neon, on the
other hand, is a gas that gives off a red glow when electricity flows
through it. The lighted sign in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2lnbg..) contains neon.

**Q:** Do you know properties of any other elements? For example, what
do you know about helium?

**A:** Helium is a gas that has a lower density than air. That’s why
helium balloons have to be weighted down so they won’t float away.

**Q:** Living things, like all matter, are made of elements. Do you know
which element is most common in living things?

**A:** Carbon is the most common element in living things. It has the
unique property of being able to combine with many other elements as
well as with itself. This allows carbon to form a huge number of
different substances.

### History of Elements {#3.html#x-ck12-SGlzdG9yeSBvZiBFbGVtZW50cw.._4-7dl}

For thousands of years, people have wondered about the substances that
make up matter. About 2500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle
argued that all matter is made up of just four elements, which he
identified as earth, air, water, and fire. He thought that different
substances vary in their properties because they contain different
proportions of these four elements. Aristotle had the right idea, but he
was wrong about which substances are elements. Nonetheless, his four
elements were accepted until just a few hundred years ago. Then
scientists started discovering many of the elements with which we are
familiar today. Eventually they discovered dozens of different elements.
You can read how and when the different elements were discovered at this
URL: [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/content/origindc.pdf](origindc.pdf) .

### Particles of Elements {#3.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljbGVzIG9mIEVsZW1lbnRz_4-daw}

The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of
that element is the **atom** . Atoms actually consist of smaller
particles, including protons and electrons, but these smaller particles
are the same for all elements. All the atoms of an element are like one
another, and are different from the atoms of all other elements. For
example, the atoms of each element have a unique number of protons.

Consider carbon as an example. Carbon atoms have six protons. They also
have six electrons. All carbon atoms are the same whether they are found
in a lump of coal or a teaspoon of table sugar ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtY2FyYm9u) ). On the other hand, carbon
atoms are different from the atoms of hydrogen, which are also found in
coal and sugar. Each hydrogen atom has just one proton and one electron.

**Figure 3.9**

Carbon is the main element in coal (left). Carbon is also a major
component of sugar (right).

</div>

**Q:** Why do you think coal and sugar are so different from one another
when carbon is a major component of each substance?

**A:** Coal and sugar differ from one another because they contain
different proportions of carbon and other elements. For example, coal is
about 85 percent carbon, whereas table sugar is about 42 percent carbon.
Both coal and sugar also contain the elements hydrogen and oxygen but in
different proportions. In addition, coal contains the elements nitrogen
and sulfur.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-3mw}

-   An element is a pure substance that cannot be separated into any
    other substances. There are 92 naturally occurring elements.
-   Each element has a unique set of properties that is different from
    the set of properties of any other element.
-   For about 2000 years, people accepted Aristotle’s idea that all
    matter is made up of just four elements: earth, air, water,
    and fire. Starting about 500 years ago, scientists began discovering
    all of the elements that are known today.
-   The smallest particle of an element that still has the properties of
    that element is the atom. All the atoms of an element are like one
    another, and are different from the atoms of all other elements.

What is this strange-looking object? Can you guess what it is? It’s a
model of a certain type of matter. Some types of matter are elements, or
pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Many
other types of matter are compounds. The model above represents a
compound. The compound it represents is carbon dioxide, a gas you exhale
each time you breathe.

### What Is a Compound? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENvbXBvdW5kPw.._5-cpq}

A **compound** is a unique substance that forms when two or more
elements combine chemically. For example, the compound carbon dioxide
forms when one atom of carbon (grey in the model above) combines with
two atoms of oxygen (red in the model). Another example of a compound is
water. It forms when two hydrogen atoms combine with one oxygen atom.
You can learn more about compounds and how they form by watching the
video at this URL:

Two things are true of all compounds:

-   A compound always has the same elements in the same proportions. For
    example, carbon dioxide always has two atoms of oxygen for each atom
    of carbon, and water always has two atoms of hydrogen for each atom
    of oxygen.
-   A compound always has the same composition throughout. For example,
    all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and all the water in the
    ocean have these same proportions of elements.

**Q:** How do you think the properties of compounds compare with the
properties of the elements that form them?

**A:** You might expect the properties of a compound to be similar to
the properties of the elements that make up the compound. But you would
be wrong.

### Properties of Compounds {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBDb21wb3VuZHM._5-uhr}

The properties of compounds are different from the properties of the
elements that form them—sometimes very different. That’s because
elements in a compound combine and become an entirely different
substance with its own unique properties. Do you put salt on your food?
Table salt is the compound sodium chloride. It contains sodium and
chlorine. As shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfU29kaXVtLUNobG9yaWRl) , sodium is a solid
that reacts explosively with water, and chlorine is a poisonous gas. But
together in table salt, sodium and chlorine form a harmless unreactive
compound that you can safely eat.

**Q:** The compound sodium chloride is very different from the elements
sodium and chlorine that combine to form it. What are some properties of
sodium chloride?

**A:** Sodium chloride is an odorless white solid that is harmless
unless consumed in large quantities. In fact, it is a necessary
component of the human diet.

### Structure of Compounds {#3.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIENvbXBvdW5kcw.._5-0hx}

Compounds like sodium chloride form structures called crystals. A
**crystal** is a rigid framework of many ions locked together in a
repeating pattern. Ions are electrically charged forms of atoms. You can
see a crystal of sodium chloride in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzZfc2FsdGNyeXN0YWw.) . It is made up
of many sodium and chloride ions.

Compounds such as carbon dioxide and water form molecules instead of
crystals. A **molecule** is the smallest particle of a compound that
still has the compound’s properties. It consists of two or more atoms
bonded together. You saw models of carbon dioxide and water molecules

Ahhhh! A tall glass of ice-cold lemonade is really refreshing on a hot
day. Lemonade is a combination of lemon juice, water, and sugar. Do you
know what kind of matter lemonade is? It’s obviously not an element
because it consists of more than one substance. Is it a compound? Not
all combined substances are compounds. Some—including lemonade—are
mixtures.  

### What Is a Mixture? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIE1peHR1cmU__6-cfj}

A **mixture** is a combination of two or more substances in any
proportion. This is different from a compound, which consists of
substances in fixed proportions. The substances in a mixture also do not
combine chemically to form a new substance, as they do in a compound.
Instead, they just intermingle and keep their original properties. The
lemonade pictured above is a mixture because it doesn’t have fixed
proportions of ingredients. It could have more or less lemon juice, for
example, or more or less sugar, and it would still be lemonade.

**Q:** What are some other examples of mixtures?

**A:** Other examples of liquid mixtures include salt water and salad
dressing. Air is a mixture of gases, mainly nitrogen and oxygen. The
rock pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzdfcm9jaw..) is a solid mixture.

This rock is a mixture of smaller rocks and minerals.

</div>

### Homogeneous or Heterogeneous? {#3.html#x-ck12-SG9tb2dlbmVvdXMgb3IgSGV0ZXJvZ2VuZW91cz8._6-lih}

The lemonade in the opening picture is an example of a homogeneous
mixture. A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout.
Another example of a homogeneous mixture is salt water. If you analyzed
samples of ocean water in different places, you would find that the
proportion of salt in each sample is the same: 3.5 percent.

The rock in **Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzdfcm9jaw..)
is an example of a heterogeneous mixture. A heterogeneous mixture varies
in its composition. The black nuggets, for example, are not distributed
evenly throughout the rock.

### Types of Mixtures {#3.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTWl4dHVyZXM._6-icq}

Mixtures have different properties depending on the size of their
particles. Three types of mixtures based on particle size are solutions,
suspensions, and colloids, all of which are described in **Table**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TWl4dHVyZXNUeXBl) . You can watch videos about
the three types of mixtures at these URLs:

**Q:** If you buy a can of paint at a paint store, a store employee may
put the can on a shaker machine to mix up the paint in the can. What
type of mixture is the paint?

**A:** The paint is a suspension. Some of the components of the paint
settle out of the mixture when it sits undisturbed for a long time. This
explains why you need to shake (or stir) the paint before you use it.

**Q:** The milk you buy in the supermarket has gone through a process
called homogenization. This process breaks up the cream in the milk into
smaller particles. As a result, the cream doesn’t separate out of the
milk no matter how long it sits on the shelf. Which type of mixture is
homogenized milk?

**A:** Homogenized milk is a colloid. The particles in the milk are
large enough to see—that’s why milk is white instead of clear like
water, which is the main component of milk. However, the particles are
not large enough to settle out of the mixture.

### Separating Mixtures {#3.html#x-ck12-U2VwYXJhdGluZyBNaXh0dXJlcw.._6-dn9}

The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine,
so they retain their physical properties. Examples of physical
properties include boiling point, ability to dissolve, and particle
size. When components of mixtures vary in physical properties such as
these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or filtering can be used
to separate them.

Look at the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNF8xXzFfc2FsdGJlYWNo) of the Great Salt
Lake in Utah. The water in the lake is a solution of salt and water. Do
you see the white salt deposits near the shore? How did the salt
separate from the salt water? Water has a lower boiling point than salt,
and it evaporates in the heat of the sun. With its higher boiling point,
the salt doesn’t get hot enough to evaporate, so it is left behind.

**Q:** Suppose you have a mixture of salt and pepper. What properties of
the salt and pepper might allow you to separate them?

**A:** Salt dissolves in water but pepper does not. If you mix salt and
pepper with water, only the salt will dissolve, leaving the pepper
floating in the water. You can separate the pepper from the water by
pouring the mixture through a filter, such as a coffee filter.

**Q:** After you separate the pepper from the salt water, how could you
separate the salt from the water?

**A:** You could heat the water until it boils and evaporates. The salt
would be left behind.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-mz3}

-   A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in
    any proportions. The substances in a mixture do not combine
    chemically, so they retain their physical properties.
-   A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout. A
    heterogeneous mixture varies in its composition.

These stunning rock arches in Utah were carved by wind-blown sand.
Repeated scouring by the sand wore away the rock, bit by tiny bit, like
sandpaper on wood. The bits of rock worn away by the sand still contain
the same minerals as they did when they were part of the large rock.
They have not changed chemically in any way. Only the size and shape of
the rock have changed, from a single large rock to millions of tiny bits
of rock. Changes in size and shape are physical changes in matter.

### What Is a Physical Change? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFBoeXNpY2FsIENoYW5nZT8._7-347}

A **physical change** is a change in one or more physical properties of
matter without any change in chemical properties. In other words, matter
doesn’t change into a different substance in a physical change. Examples
of physical change include changes in the size or shape of matter.
Changes of state—for example, from solid to liquid or from liquid to
gas—are also physical changes. Some of the processes that cause physical
changes include cutting, bending, dissolving, freezing, boiling, and
melting. Four examples of physical change are pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzhfcGh5c2ljYWxjb21wb3NpdGU.) . You

**Q:** In the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzhfcGh5c2ljYWxjb21wb3NpdGU.) , what
physical changes are occurring?

**A:** The paper is being cut into smaller pieces, which is changing its
size and shape. The ice cubes are turning into a puddle of liquid water
because they are melting. This is a change of state. The tablet is
disappearing in the glass of water because it is dissolving into
particles that are too small to see. The lighthouse is becoming coated
with ice as ocean spray freezes on its surface. This is another change
of state.

### Reversing Physical Changes {#3.html#x-ck12-UmV2ZXJzaW5nIFBoeXNpY2FsIENoYW5nZXM._7-jou}

When matter undergoes physical change, it doesn’t become a different
substance. Therefore, physical changes are often easy to reverse. For
example, when liquid water freezes to form ice, it can be changed back
to liquid water by heating and melting the ice.

**Q:** Salt dissolving in water is a physical change. How could this
change be reversed?

**A:** The salt water could be boiled until the water evaporates,
leaving behind the salt. Water vapor from the boiling water could be
captured and cooled. The water vapor would condense and change back to
liquid water.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-vfg}

-   A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matter’s
    physical properties. In a physical change, matter may change its
    size, shape, or state, but its chemical properties do not change.
-   Because the chemical properties of matter remain the same in a
    physical change, a physical change is often easy to reverse.

Communities often use fireworks to celebrate important occasions.
Fireworks certainly create awesome sights and sounds! Do you know what
causes the brilliant lights and loud booms of a fireworks display? The
answer is chemical changes.  

### What Is a Chemical Change? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENoZW1pY2FsIENoYW5nZT8._8-ilg}

A **chemical change** occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely
different substance with different chemical properties. A chemical
change is also called a chemical reaction. Many complex chemical changes
occur to produce the explosions of fireworks. An example of a simpler
chemical change is the burning of methane. Methane is the main component
of natural gas, which is burned in many home furnaces. During burning,
methane combines with oxygen in the air to produce entirely different
chemical substances, including the gases carbon dioxide and water vapor.
You can watch some very colorful chemical changes occurring in the video
at this URL:

### Identifying Chemical Changes {#3.html#x-ck12-SWRlbnRpZnlpbmcgQ2hlbWljYWwgQ2hhbmdlcw.._8-xtu}

Most chemical changes are not as dramatic as exploding fireworks, so how
can you tell whether a chemical change has occurred? There are usually
clues. You just need to know what to look for. A chemical change has
probably occurred if bubbles are released, there is a change of color,
or an odor is produced. Other clues include the release of heat, light,
or loud sounds. Examples of chemical changes that produce these clues
are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hlbWljYWxfQ2hhbmdlcw..) .

**Q:** In addition to iron rusting, what is another example of matter
changing color? Do you think this color change is a sign that a new
chemical substance has been produced?

**A:** Another example of matter changing color is a penny changing from
reddish brown to greenish brown as it becomes tarnished. The color
change indicates that a new chemical substance has been produced. Copper
on the surface of the penny has combined with oxygen in the air to
produce a different substance called copper oxide.

**Q:** Besides food spoiling, what is another change that produces an
odor? Is this a chemical change?

**A:** When wood burns, it produces a smoky odor. Burning is a chemical
change.

**Q:** Which signs of chemical change do fireworks produce?

**A:** Fireworks produce heat, light, and loud sounds. These are all
signs of chemical change. You can learn how fireworks produce these
signs of chemical change at this URL:
[http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/fireworks/fireworks.htm](fireworks.htm)
.

### Can Chemical Changes Be Reversed? {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2FuIENoZW1pY2FsIENoYW5nZXMgQmUgUmV2ZXJzZWQ__8-hmg}

Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be
undone. For example, you can’t change ashes from burning logs back into
wood. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical
changes. For example, to undo tarnish on copper pennies, you can place
them in vinegar. The acid in the vinegar combines with the copper oxide
of the tarnish. This changes the copper oxide back to copper and oxygen,
making the pennies reddish brown again. You can try this at home to see
how well it works.  

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-y9u}

-   A chemical change occurs whenever matter changes into an entirely
    different substance with different chemical properties. Burning is
    an example of a chemical change.
-   Signs of chemical change include the release of bubbles, a change of
    color, production of an odor, release of heat and light, and
    production of loud sounds.
-   Because chemical changes result in different substances, they often

If you build a campfire like this one, you start with a big pile of
logs. As the fire burns, the pile of logs slowly shrinks. By the end of
the evening, all that’s left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to
the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the fire?

### Where’s the Matter? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmXigJlzIHRoZSBNYXR0ZXI__9-wed}

It may seem as though burning destroys matter, but the same amount, or
mass, of matter still exists after a campfire as before. Look at the
sketch in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMDItMDEtMTAtQnVybmluZw..) . It shows that
when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes not only to ashes
but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases float off into the
air, leaving behind just the ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of
the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned.
Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the fire
and the gases produced by the fire. What would you find? The total mass
of matter after the fire would be the same as the total mass of matter
before the fire.

**Figure 3.18**

Burning is a chemical process.

</div>

**Q:** What can you infer from this example?

**A:** You can infer that burning does not destroy matter. It just
changes matter into different substances.

### Law of Conservation of Mass {#3.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIENvbnNlcnZhdGlvbiBvZiBNYXNz_9-dru}

This burning campfire example illustrates a very important law in
science: the **law of conservation of mass** . This law states that
matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through a
physical or chemical change, the total mass of matter always remains the
same.

**Q:** How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when
matter changes state?

**A:** You could find the mass of a quantity of liquid water. Then you
could freeze the water and find the mass of the ice. The mass before and
after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when
matter changes state.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-kq8}

-   Burning and other changes in matter do not destroy matter. The mass
    of matter is always the same before and after the changes occur.
-   The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created
    or destroyed.

The striking blue walls in this photo are actually the sheer ice walls
of a massive glacier. The glacier in the picture is in Argentina, and
the bluish water in the foreground is Lake Argentina. The photo
represents an important concept in physical science. Can you guess what
it is?

### Water, Water Everywhere {#3.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIsIFdhdGVyIEV2ZXJ5d2hlcmU._10-yi4}

The photo above represents water in three common states of matter.
**States of matter** are different phases in which any given type of
matter can exist. There are actually four well-known states of matter:
solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Plasma isn’t represented in the iceberg
photo, but the other three states of matter are. The iceberg itself
consists of water in the solid state, and the lake consists of water in
the liquid state.

**Q:** Where is water in the gaseous state in the above photo?

**A:** You can’t see the gaseous water, but it’s there. It exists as
water vapor in the air.

**Q:** Water is one of the few substances that commonly exist on Earth
in more than one state. Many other substances typically exist only in
the solid, liquid, or gaseous state. Can you think of examples of matter
that usually exists in just one of these three states?

**A:** Just look around you and you will see many examples of matter
that usually exists in the solid state. They include soil, rock, wood,
metal, glass, and plastic. Examples of matter that usually exist in the
liquid state include cooking oil, gasoline, and mercury, which is the
only metal that commonly exists as a liquid. Examples of matter that
usually exists in the gaseous state include oxygen and nitrogen, which
are the chief gases in Earth’s atmosphere.

### Phases Are Physical {#3.html#x-ck12-UGhhc2VzIEFyZSBQaHlzaWNhbA.._10-rex}

A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same
chemical properties regardless of its state. That’s because state of
matter is a physical property. As a result, when matter changes state,
it doesn’t become a different kind of substance. For example, water is
still water whether it exists as ice, liquid water, or water vapor.

### Properties of Solids, Liquids, and Gases {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBTb2xpZHMsIExpcXVpZHMsIGFuZCBHYXNlcw.._10-w4l}

What do you think this picture shows? Could it be a delicate glass
sculpture created by a talented artist? It’s delicate alright, but it’s
not glass, nor was it created by an artist. It’s actually made of ice
and it’s a work of nature. Now can you guess what it is? It’s a
snowflake, as viewed under a microscope.

### Snowflakes and Other Solids {#3.html#x-ck12-U25vd2ZsYWtlcyBhbmQgT3RoZXIgU29saWRz_11-oxc}

A snowflake is made of ice, or water in the solid state. A **solid** is
one of four well-known states of matter. The other three states are
liquid, gas, and plasma. Compared with these other states of matter,
solids have particles that are much more tightly packed together. The
particles are held rigidly in place by all the other particles around
them so they can’t slip past one another or move apart. This gives
solids a fixed shape and a fixed volume.

### Types of Solids {#3.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgU29saWRz_11-vdr}

Not all solids are alike. Some are crystalline solids; others are
amorphous solids. Snowflakes are crystalline solids. Particles of
crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern, as you
can see in the sketch in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-UFNfU2FsdF9Db21wb3NpdGU.) . The repeating
particles form a geometric shape called a crystal. You can watch a
snowflake crystal forming at the following URL:
[http://www.its.caltech.edu/\~atomic/snowcrystals/movies/movies.htm](movies.htm)
. Another crystalline solid is table salt (sodium chloride). Crystals of
table salt are pictured in the **Figure**

**A:** The quartz is a crystalline solid. Rocks are made of minerals and
minerals form crystals. You can see their geometric shapes. The bag is
an amorphous solid. It is made of the plastic and most plastics do not
form crystals.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-mdb}

-   A solid is a state of matter in which particles of matter are
    tightly packed together. This holds the particles rigidly in place
    and gives solids a fixed shape and fixed volume.
-   Crystalline solids have particles that are arranged in a regular
    repeating pattern. They form crystals. Amorphous solids have
    particles that are arranged more-or-less at random. They do not
    form crystals.

Colored by lights at night, an incredible amount of water plunges
continuously over the sheer rock wall of Niagara Falls. If you stand
close to the falls, the roar of the water is almost deafening, and the
rushing water drenches you with spray. No wonder Niagara Falls was once
named one of the seven natural wonders of the world! It’s amazing how
such a common substance—water—can be so impressive.

### Water and Other Liquids {#3.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgYW5kIE90aGVyIExpcXVpZHM._12-uwz}

Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in
the liquid state. A **liquid** is one of four well-known states of
matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states. The particles of
liquids are in close contact with each other but not as tightly packed
as the particles in solids. The particles can slip past one another and
take the shape of their container. However, they cannot pull apart and
spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas
can. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container,
the top surface of the liquid will be exposed to the air, like the
vinegar in the bottle pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfVmluZWdhci1Cb3R0bGU.) .

**Q:** Why does most water on Earth’s surface exist in a liquid state?
In what other states does water exist on Earth?

**A:** Almost 97 percent of water on Earth’s surface is found as liquid
salt water in the oceans. The temperature over most of Earth’s surface
is above the freezing point (0°C) of water, so relatively little water
exists as ice. Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is
above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earth’s surface do
temperatures reach the boiling point (100°C) of water. Although water
exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state, water vapor makes up less
than 1 percent of Earth’s total water.

### Surface Tension and Viscosity {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBUZW5zaW9uIGFuZCBWaXNjb3NpdHk._12-rws}

Two unique properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity.
Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface
of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why
water forms droplets, like the water droplet that has formed on the
leaky faucet pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGVha3ktRmF1Y2V0) . You can learn more

Viscosity is a liquid’s resistance to flowing. You can think of it as
friction between particles of liquid. Thicker liquids are more viscous
than thinner liquids. For example, the honey pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmlzY29zaXR5) is more viscous than the
vinegar. You can learn more about viscosity at this URL:

A hiker pauses to view the impressive peak of Mount Everest, the tallest
mountain in the world. At the top of Mount Everest, the air is very
thin. Climbers may need oxygen tanks to get enough oxygen to breathe,
even though oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the atmosphere.

### What Is a Gas? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIEdhcz8._13-jiy}

A **gas** is one of four well-known states of matter. (The other three
are solid, liquid, and plasma). The particles of a gas can pull apart
from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a fixed
shape or a fixed volume. In fact, a gas always spreads out to take up
whatever space is available to it. If a gas is enclosed in a container,
it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container.

**Q:** The sketches in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm94ZXNWb2x1bWU.) represent two identical
sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented by dots).
There are more air particles in box B than box A. Which box contains a
greater volume of air?

**Figure 3.29**

</div>

**A:** This is a trick question! The air inside each box expands to fill
the available space, which is identical for both boxes. There are more
air particles in box B, but the volume of air is exactly the same in
both boxes.

### Pressure of Gases {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJlc3N1cmUgb2YgR2FzZXM._13-wzm}

Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random. As a
result, they are always bumping into each other and other things. This
is modeled in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR2FzX1BhcnRpY2xlcw..) . The force of the
particles against things they bump into creates pressure. **Pressure**
is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given
area. How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas
particles in a given space and how fast they are moving. The more gas
particles there are and the faster they are moving, the greater the
pressure they create. To learn more about gas pressure and how to
measure it, go to this URL:

**Figure 3.30**

The arrows show that particles of a gas move randomly in all directions.

</div>

**Q:** Look at box A and box B in the previous question. Is air pressure
the same in both boxes? Why or why not?

**A:** Air pressure is greater in box B. That’s because there are more
air particles in box B to bump into each other and into the sides of the
container. Therefore, the particles in box B exert more force on a given
area.

### Pressure in the Atmosphere {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJlc3N1cmUgaW4gdGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmU._13-n4h}

We live in a “sea” of air called the atmosphere. Can you feel the air in
the atmosphere pressing against you? Not usually, but air actually
exerts a lot of pressure because there’s so much of it. The atmosphere
rises high above Earth’s surface, so it contains a huge number of gas
particles. Most of them are concentrated close to Earth’s surface
because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above
them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops
rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQXRtb3NwaGVyaWMtUHJlc3N1cmU.) shows how
air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere. In the
graph, air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar (mb). The
SI unit of pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm ^2^ ).

**Q:** The top of Mount Everest is almost 9 km above sea level. What is
the pressure of the atmosphere at this altitude?

**A:** Air pressure at the top of Mount Everest is about 260 mb. This is
only about 25 percent of air pressure at sea level, which is 1013.2 mb.
No wonder it’s hard for climbers to breathe when they get close to Mount
Everest’s summit!

-   Gas is a state of matter in which particles of matter can pull apart
    from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a

This glowing sphere is matter in a particular state. You’re probably
familiar with the states of matter most common on Earth—solid, liquid,
and gas. But the glowing sphere is a state of matter called plasma. The
plasma ball pictured above was made by humans, but plasma is also found
in nature. In fact, plasma makes up most of the matter in the universe.

### What Is Plasma? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBQbGFzbWE__14-wkx}

**Plasma** is a state of matter that resembles a gas but has certain
properties that gases do not have. Like a gas, plasma consists of
particles of matter than can pull apart and spread out, so it lacks a
fixed volume and a fixed shape. Unlike a gas, plasma can conduct
electricity and respond to a magnetic field. That’s because plasma
consists of electrically charged particles called ions, instead of
uncharged particles such as atoms or molecules. This gives plasma other
interesting properties as well. For example, plasma glows with colored
light when electricity passes through it. You can learn more about
plasma at this URL:

### Where Is Plasma Found? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgSXMgUGxhc21hIEZvdW5kPw.._14-tfm}

The sun and other stars consist of plasma. Plasma is also found
naturally in lightning and in the northern and southern lights. If

This neat row of cola bottles represents matter in three different
states—solid, liquid, and gas. The bottles and caps are solids, the cola
is a liquid, and carbon dioxide dissolved in the cola is a gas. It gives
cola its fizz. Solids, liquids, and gases such as these have different
properties. Solids have a fixed shape and a fixed volume. Liquids also
have a fixed volume but can change their shape. Gases have neither a
fixed shape nor a fixed volume. What explains these differences in
states of matter? The answer has to do with energy.

### Moving Matter {#3.html#x-ck12-TW92aW5nIE1hdHRlcg.._15-bq4}

Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter. For example, your body
uses chemical energy when you lift your arm or take a step. In both
cases, energy is used to move matter—you. Any matter that is moving has
energy just because it’s moving. The energy of moving matter is called
kinetic energy. Scientists think that the particles of all matter are in
constant motion. In other words, the particles of matter have kinetic
energy. The theory that all matter consists of constantly moving
particles is called the **kinetic theory of matter** . You can learn
more about the theory at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agk7\_D4-deY](watch?v=Agk7_D4-deY) .

### Kinetic Energy and States of Matter {#3.html#x-ck12-S2luZXRpYyBFbmVyZ3kgYW5kIFN0YXRlcyBvZiBNYXR0ZXI._15-bau}

Differences in kinetic energy explain why matter exists in different
states. Particles of matter are attracted to each other, so they tend to
pull together. The particles can move apart only if they have enough
kinetic energy to overcome this force of attraction. It’s like a tug of
war between opposing sides, with the force of attraction between
particles on one side and the kinetic energy of individual particles on
the other side. The outcome of the “war” determines the state of matter.

-   If particles do not have enough kinetic energy to overcome the force
    of attraction between them, matter exists as a solid. The particles
    are packed closely together and held rigidly in place. All they can
    do is vibrate. This explains why solids have a fixed volume and a
    fixed shape.
-   If particles have enough kinetic energy to partly overcome the force
    of attraction between them, matter exists as a liquid. The particles
    can slide past one another but not pull apart completely. This
    explains why liquids can change shape but have a fixed volume.
-   If particles have enough kinetic energy to completely overcome the
    force of attraction between them, matter exists as a gas. The
    particles can pull apart and spread out. This explains why gases
    have neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape.

Look at the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWF0dGVyX2FuZF9FbmVyZ3k.) . It sums up
visually the relationship between kinetic energy and state of matter.

</div>

**Q:** How could you use a bottle of cola to demonstrate these
relationships between kinetic energy and state of matter?

**A:** You could shake a bottle of cola and then open it. Shaking causes
carbon dioxide to come out of the cola solution and change to a gas. The
gas fizzes out of the bottle and spreads into the surrounding air,
showing that its particles have enough kinetic energy to spread apart.
Then you could tilt the open bottle and pour out a small amount of the
cola on a table, where it will form a puddle. This shows that particles
of the liquid have enough kinetic energy to slide over each other but
not enough to pull apart completely. If you do nothing to the solid
glass of the cola bottle, it will remain the same size and shape. Its
particles do not have enough energy to move apart or even to slide over
each other.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-pfe}

-   According to the kinetic theory, particles of matter are in
    constant motion. The energy of motion is called kinetic energy.
-   The kinetic energy of particles of matter determines the state
    of matter. Particles of solids have the least kinetic energy and
    particles of gases have the most.

Both of these photos show the famous Golden Gate Bridge near San
Francisco, California. The pictures were taken from about the same point
of view, but they look very different. In the picture on the left, the
deck of the bridge is almost completely hidden by a thick layer of fog.
In the picture on the right the fog has disappeared, and the deck of the
bridge—as well as the water below it—is clearly visible. Fog consists of
tiny droplets of liquid water. The fog in the picture is like a cloud at
ground level. Where did the fog come from, and where did it go?

### What Are Changes of State? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQ2hhbmdlcyBvZiBTdGF0ZT8._16-u9y}

The water droplets of fog form from water vapor in the air. Fog
disappears when the water droplets change back to water vapor. These
changes are examples of changes of state. A change of state occurs
whenever matter changes from one state to another. Common states of
matter on Earth are solid, liquid, and gas. Matter may change back and
forth between any two of these states.

Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible
changes that do not change matter’s chemical makeup or chemical
properties. For example, when fog changes to water vapor, it is still
water and can change back to liquid water again.

### Processes that Cause Changes of State {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvY2Vzc2VzIHRoYXQgQ2F1c2UgQ2hhbmdlcyBvZiBTdGF0ZQ.._16-txh}

Several processes are involved in common changes of state. They include
melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and
evaporation. The **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfUGhhc2UtQ2hhbmdlLVByb2Nlc3M.) shows how
matter changes in each of these processes.

**Figure 3.37**

</div>

**Q:** What happened to the chocolate?

**A:** The chocolate melted. It changed from a solid to a liquid.

In order for solid chocolate to melt and change to a liquid, the
particles of chocolate must gain energy. The chocolate pictured in the
**Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWVsdGVkLUNob2NvbGF0ZQ..)
gained energy from sunlight. Energy is the ability to cause changes in
matter, and it is always involved in changes of state. When matter
changes from one state to another, it either absorbs energy—as when
chocolate melts—or loses energy. For example, if you were to place the
melted chocolate in a refrigerator, it would lose energy to the cold air
inside the refrigerator. As a result, the liquid chocolate would change
to a solid again.

**Q:** Why is energy always involved in changes of state?

**A:** The energy of particles of matter determines the matter's state.
Particles of a gas have more energy than particles of a liquid, and
particles of a liquid have more energy than particles of a solid.
Therefore, in order for matter to change from a solid to a liquid or
from a liquid to a gas, particles of matter must absorb energy. In order
for matter to change from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid,
particles of matter must lose energy.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-xa2}

-   A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state
    to another. Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They
    are reversible changes that do not change matter’s chemical makeup
    or chemical properties.
-   Processes involved in changes of state include melting, freezing,

The man in this photo is climbing a glacier. Ice climbing is a dangerous
sport that should be attempted only by highly experienced climbers. For
one thing, ice is very slippery, which makes it harder than rock to
grip. Clinging to the slippery vertical surface takes strength,
training, and the right equipment.

### From Liquid to Solid {#3.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBMaXF1aWQgdG8gU29saWQ._17-qkx}

You don’t have to be an ice climber to enjoy ice. Skating and fishing
are two other sports that are also done on ice. What is ice? It’s simply
water in the solid state. The process in which water or any other liquid
changes to a solid is called **freezing** . Freezing occurs when a
liquid cools to a point at which its particles no longer have enough
energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. Instead, the
particles remain in fixed positions, crowded closely together, as shown
in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnJlZXppbmc.) .

### Freezing Point {#3.html#x-ck12-RnJlZXppbmcgUG9pbnQ._17-4ja}

The temperature at which a substance freezes is known as its freezing
point. Freezing point is a physical property of matter. The freezing
point of pure water is 0°C. Below this temperature, water exists as ice.
Above this temperature, it exists as liquid water or water vapor. Many
other substances have much lower or higher freezing points than water.
You can see some examples in the **Table**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-RnJlZXppbmc.) . The freezing point of pure water
is included in the table for comparison.

  Substance    Freezing Point (°C)
  ------------ ---------------------
  Helium       -272
  Oxygen       -222
  Nitrogen     -210
  Pure Water   0
  Lead         328
  Iron         1535
  Carbon       3500

**Q:** What trend do you see in this table?

**A:** Substances in the table with freezing points lower than water are
gases. Substances in the table with freezing points higher than water
are solids.

**Q:** Sodium is a solid at room temperature. Given this information,
what can you infer about its freezing point?

**A:** You can infer that the freezing point of sodium must be higher
than room temperature, which is about 20°C. The freezing point of sodium
is actually 98°C.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-6zq}

-   Freezing is the process in which a liquid changes to a solid. It
    occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which its particles no
    longer have enough energy to overcome the force of attraction
    between them.
-   The freezing point of a substance is the temperature at which
    it freezes. The freezing point of pure water is 0°C.

The fiery red-orange “river” flowing downhill in this photo isn’t water.
It’s molten (melted) rock, and it’s erupting from a volcano. Most rocks
on Earth’s surface are solid objects. Why is the rock that erupts from a
volcano in a liquid state? How does rock change from a solid to a
liquid?

### From Solid to Liquid {#3.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBTb2xpZCB0byBMaXF1aWQ._18-5xt}

The process in which rocks or other solids change to liquids is called
melting. **Melting** occurs when particles of a solid absorb enough
energy to partly overcome the force of attraction holding them together.
This allows them to move out of their fixed positions and slip over one
another. Melting, like other changes of state, is a physical change in
matter, so it doesn’t change the chemical makeup or chemical properties
of matter.

**Q:** The molten rock that erupts from a volcano comes from deep
underground. How is this related to its liquid state?

**A:** It is always very hot deep underground where molten rock
originates. The high temperatures give rock enough energy to melt and
remain in a molten state. Underground rock in this state is called
magma.

**Q:** What happens to magma after it erupts and starts flowing over the
surface of the ground?

**A:** After magma erupts, it is called lava. On the surface, lava
eventually cools and hardens to form solid rock.

Other substances that are normally solids on Earth can also be heated
until they melt. You can see an example in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzE5X2dvbGQ.) . The photo shows
molten gold being poured into a mold. When the gold cools, it will
harden into a solid gold bar that has the same shape as the mold.

### Melting Point {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVsdGluZyBQb2ludA.._18-s8o}

The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point.
Melting point is a physical property of matter. The gold pictured in the
**Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzE5X2dvbGQ.) , for
example, has a melting point of 1064°C. This is a high melting point,
and most other metals also have high melting points. The melting point
of ice, in comparison, is much lower at 0°C. Many substances have even
lower melting points. For example, the melting point of oxygen is
-222°C.

### Melting and Global Climate Change {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVsdGluZyBhbmQgR2xvYmFsIENsaW1hdGUgQ2hhbmdl_18-cte}

Because of global climate change, temperatures all over Earth are
rising. However, the melting points of Earth’s substances, including
ice, are constant. The result? Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate.
Melting glaciers cause rising sea levels and the risk of dangerous river
flooding on land. You can learn more about these effects of melting at

Why is steam rising from the spring in this picture? It’s because the
water is boiling hot. The bubbles in the water show that it is boiling.
The water in the spring is hot enough to boil because it comes from an
underground source near hot molten rock.

### All Steamed Up {#3.html#x-ck12-QWxsIFN0ZWFtZWQgVXA._19-o51}

Steam actually consists of tiny droplets of liquid water. What you can’t
see in the picture is the water vapor that is also present in the air
above the spring. Water vapor is water in the gaseous state. It
constantly rises up from the surface of boiling hot water. Why? At high
temperatures, particles of a liquid gain enough energy to completely
overcome the force of attraction between them, so they change to a gas.
The gas forms bubbles that rise to the surface of the liquid because gas
is less dense than liquid. The bubbling up of the liquid is called
boiling. When the bubbles reach the surface, the gas escapes into the
air. The entire process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas
that escapes into the air is called **vaporization** . You can watch an
animation of the process at this URL:

**Q:** Why does steam form over the hot spring pictured above?

**A:** Steam forms when some of the water vapor from the boiling water
cools in the air and condenses to form droplets of liquid water.

### Vaporization vs. Evaporation {#3.html#x-ck12-VmFwb3JpemF0aW9uIHZzLiBFdmFwb3JhdGlvbg.._19-p8x}

Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but the two processes
are not the same. Evaporation also changes a liquid to a gas, but it
doesn’t involve boiling. Instead, evaporation occurs when particles at
the surface of a liquid gain enough energy to escape into the air. This
happens without the liquid becoming hot enough to boil.

### Boiling Point {#3.html#x-ck12-Qm9pbGluZyBQb2ludA.._19-zo2}

The temperature at which a substance boils and changes to a gas is
called its boiling point. Boiling point is a physical property of
matter. The boiling point of pure water is 100°C. Other substances may
have higher or lower boiling points. Several examples are listed in the
**Table** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qm9pbGluZw..) . Pure water is included
in the table for comparison.

  Substance           Boiling Point (°C)
  ------------------- --------------------
  Hydrogen            -253
  Nitrogen            -196
  Carbon dioxide      -79
  Ammonia             -36
  Pure water          100
  Salty ocean water   101
  Petroleum           210
  Olive oil           300
  Sodium chloride     1413

**Q:** Assume you want to get the salt (sodium chloride) out of salt
water. Based on information in the table, how could you do it?

**A:** You could heat the salt water to 101°C. The water would boil and
vaporize but the salt would not. Instead, the salt would be left behind
as solid particles.

**Q:** Oxygen is a gas at room temperature (20°C). What does this tell
you about its boiling point?

**A:** The boiling point of oxygen must be lower than 20°C. Otherwise,
it would be a liquid at room temperature.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-7tc}

-   Vaporization is the process in which a liquid boils and changes to
    a gas.
-   Vaporization is easily confused with evaporation, but evaporation
    doesn’t involve boiling.
-   The temperature at which a liquid boils and starts changing to a gas

The clothes on this clothesline are soaking wet, but before too long
they will be completely dry. How does this happen? Where does the water
go? And what factors might help the clothes on the line dry more
quickly?

### From Liquid to Gas Without Boiling {#3.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBMaXF1aWQgdG8gR2FzIFdpdGhvdXQgQm9pbGluZw.._20-r0u}

Evaporation explains why clothes dry on a clothesline. **Evaporation**
is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas without becoming hot
enough to boil. It occurs when individual liquid particles at the
exposed surface of the liquid absorb just enough energy to overcome the
force of attraction with other liquid particles. If the surface
particles are moving in the right direction, they will pull away from
the liquid and move into the air. This is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMi0wMS0yMS1FdmFwb3JhdGlvbg..) .

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Evaporation {#3.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEFmZmVjdCB0aGUgUmF0ZSBvZiBFdmFwb3JhdGlvbg.._20-fos}

Many factors influence how quickly a liquid evaporates. They include:

-   temperature of the liquid. A cup of hot water will evaporate more
    quickly than a cup of cold water.
-   exposed surface area of the liquid. The same amount of water will
    evaporate more quickly in a wide shallow bowl than in a tall
    narrow glass.
-   presence or absence of other substances in the liquid. Pure water
    will evaporate more quickly than salt water.
-   air movement. Clothes on a clothesline will dry more quickly on a
    windy day than on a still day.
-   concentration of the evaporating substance in the air. Clothes will
    dry more quickly when air contains little water vapor.

With the interactive animation at the URL below, you can explore how
three of these factors affect the rate of evaporation of water.

### Evaporative Cooling {#3.html#x-ck12-RXZhcG9yYXRpdmUgQ29vbGluZw.._20-9mf}

Did you ever notice that moving air cools you down when you’re hot and
sweaty? For example, if you sit in front of a fan, you feel cooler.
That’s because moving air helps to evaporate the sweat on your skin. But
why does the evaporation of sweat cool you down? When a liquid such as
sweat evaporates, energetic particles on the surface of the liquid
escape into the air. After these particles leave, the remaining liquid
has less energy, so it is cooler. This is called evaporative cooling.

</div>

**Q:** On a hot day, high humidity makes you feel even hotter. Can you
explain why?

**A:** Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air.
When humidity is high, sweat evaporates more slowly because there is
already a lot of water vapor in the air. The slower evaporation rate
reduces the potential for evaporative cooling.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-fan}

-   Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas
    without becoming hot enough to boil. It occurs only at the exposed
    surface of a liquid.
-   Many factors affect how quickly a liquid evaporates, including the
    temperature of the liquid and air movement.
-   When particles evaporate from the surface of a liquid, the remaining
    liquid is cooler because it has less energy. This is called
    evaporative cooling.

This beautiful beaded net is something very common in nature: a spider
web. The “beads” on the spider web are actually drops of water. The
drops of water are not raindrops, and they weren’t there on the previous
day. Where did they come from?

### From Gas to Liquid {#3.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBHYXMgdG8gTGlxdWlk_21-w7s}

The drops of water on the spider web are dewdrops. They formed overnight
when warm moist air came into contact with the cooler spider web.
Contact with the cooler web cooled the air. When air cools, it can hold
less water vapor, so some of the water vapor in the air changed to
liquid water. The process in which water vapor—or another gas—changes to
a liquid is called **condensation** . Another common example of
condensation is pictured in the **Figure**

### Dew Point {#3.html#x-ck12-RGV3IFBvaW50_21-yc1}

When air is very humid, it doesn’t have to cool very much for water
vapor in the air to start condensing. The temperature at which
condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies
depending on air temperature and moisture content. It is always less
than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister
air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. That’s why
glasses of cold drinks “sweat” more on a hot, humid day than they do on
a cool, dry day. For more details on the dew point, read the short
article at this URL:
[http://www.kidsgeo.com/geography-for-kids/0108-dew-point.php](0108-dew-point.php)

**Q:** What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point?

**A:** When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts
condensing. It may form dew (as on the spider web in the opening image),
clouds, or fog. Dew forms on solid objects on the ground. Clouds form on
tiny particles in the air high above the ground. Fog is a cloud that
forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground.

Rock bands often use special stage effects, like the fake fog in this
picture. Real fog forms when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny
droplets of water. The fake fog shown here formed when solid carbon
dioxide changed directly to carbon dioxide gas.

### How Sublime! {#3.html#x-ck12-SG93IFN1YmxpbWUh_22-jnl}

Solid carbon dioxide is also called dry ice. That’s because when it gets
warmer and changes state, it doesn’t change to a liquid by melting.
Instead, it changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid
state. The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called
**sublimation** . It occurs when energy is added to a solid such as dry
ice. You can watch dry ice changing directly to a gas in the video at
this URL:

**Q:** Alyssa’s mom put some mothballs in her closet in the spring to
keep moths away from her wool clothes. By autumn, the mothballs were

**A:** Mothballs are made of naphthalene, a substance that undergoes
sublimation at room temperature. The solid mothballs slowly changed to a
gas during the summer months, explaining why they were much smaller by
autumn.

### Sublimation of Snow and Ice {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VibGltYXRpb24gb2YgU25vdyBhbmQgSWNl_22-xj8}

Snow and ice may also undergo sublimation under certain conditions. This
is most likely to happen where there is intense sunlight, very cold
temperatures, and dry winds. These conditions are often found on
mountain peaks. As snow sublimates, it gradually shrinks without any
runoff of liquid water. At the URL below, you can watch a time-lapse
video showing sublimation of snow on the highest mountain in the Andes.

The leaf-like pattern on the glass pictured here is as beautiful as any
work of art. It formed on a windowpane on a very cold winter night. Do
you know how it formed? The answer is deposition.

### What Is Deposition? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBEZXBvc2l0aW9uPw.._23-kd2}

**Deposition** refers to the process in which a gas changes directly to
a solid without going through the liquid state. For example, when warm
moist air inside a house comes into contact with a freezing cold
windowpane, water vapor in the air changes to tiny ice crystals. The ice
crystals are deposited on the glass, often in beautiful patterns like
the “leaves” on the window above. Be aware that deposition has a
different meaning in Earth science than in chemistry. In Earth science,
deposition refers to the dropping of sediments by wind or water, rather
than to a change of state.

### Examples of Deposition in Nature {#3.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgRGVwb3NpdGlvbiBpbiBOYXR1cmU._23-wco}

Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature. For example,
when warm moist air comes into contact with very cold surfaces—such as
the ground or objects on the ground—ice crystals are deposited on them.
These ice crystals are commonly called frost. Look at the dead leaf and
blades of grass in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8xXzI0X2xlYWY.) . They are covered with
frost. If you look closely, you can see the individual crystals of ice.
You can watch a demonstration of frost forming on the side of a very
cold can at the URL below. (Click on the mulitmedia choice “Ice on a
Can.”). The ice in the can has been cooled to a very low temperature by
adding salt to it. If you want to do the demonstration yourself, follow
the procedure at the URL.

</div>

**Q:** In places with very cold winters, why might frost be more likely
to form on the ground in the fall than in the winter?

**A:** Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground. This is more
likely to be the case in the fall. In the winter, the air is likely to
be as cold as the ground.

Deposition also occurs high above the ground when water vapor in the air
changes to ice crystals. In the atmosphere, the ice crystals are
deposited on tiny dust particles. These ice crystals form clouds,

**Q:** Cirrus clouds form only at altitudes of 6 kilometers or higher
above sea level. Do you know why?

**A:** At this altitude, the atmosphere is always very cold. Unless the
air is cold, water vapor will condense to form water droplets instead of
ice crystals.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._23-mk4}

-   In chemistry, deposition refers to the process in which a gas
    changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state.
-   Examples of deposition in nature include frost forming on the ground
    and cirrus clouds forming high in the atmosphere.

Are you one of those people who can’t resist popping the bubbles of
bubble wrap? As annoying as it might be to the people around you, do you
just love to squeeze those little plastic bubbles? Before the bubbles
pop, the air pressing against the inside of the bubbles inflates them
like tiny balloons. When you pop the bubbles, most of the air rushes
out.

### Pop Goes the Bubble! {#3.html#x-ck12-UG9wIEdvZXMgdGhlIEJ1YmJsZSE._24-ip7}

What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it
demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other
laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain
conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state
the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The
other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to
**Boyle’s law** , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then
decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa.
That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You
decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles
increases until they pop.

### “Father” Boyle {#3.html#x-ck12-4oCcRmF0aGVy4oCdIEJveWxl_24-4yr}

Boyle’s law is named for Robert Boyle, the English scientist who
discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure. Boyle
based the law on his own controlled experiments. He published his
results, along with detailed descriptions of his procedures and
observations, in the 1660s. These steps were unheard of in his day.
Mainly because of his careful research and the details he provided about
it, Boyle has been called the “father of modern chemistry.”

### It’s Crowded in Here {#3.html#x-ck12-SXTigJlzIENyb3dkZWQgaW4gSGVyZQ.._24-bys}

Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQ29tcHJlc3M.) . The container in the
sketch has a lid that can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas
inside. Notice what happens as the lid is lowered. The gas molecules
crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and
they have nowhere else to go. Gas molecules have a lot of energy. They
are always moving and bouncing off each other and anything else in their
path. When gas molecules bump into things, it creates pressure. Pressure
is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space, because the
greater crowding results in more collisions. In other words, decreasing
the volume of a gas increases its pressure. If you go to the URL below,
you can watch a simulation of this.

### You Go Up and I’ll Go Down {#3.html#x-ck12-WW91IEdvIFVwIGFuZCBJ4oCZbGwgR28gRG93bg.._24-tld}

As the volume of gas in the container pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQ29tcHJlc3M.) gets smaller, the pressure
of the gas molecules becomes greater. When two variables change in
opposite directions like this, the variables have an inverse, or
“upside-down,” relationship.

**Q:** How could you show an inverse relationship with a graph? Sketch a
graph to show what the relationship between gas volume and pressure
might look like. Let the x-axis represent volume (V) and the y-axis
represent pressure (P).

**A:** Did you sketch a graph like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQ3VydmU.) ? Let’s see why this graph is
correct. Find the point on the line where volume is smallest. That’s
were pressure is highest. Then find the point where volume is largest.
That’s where pressure is lowest. Whenever you see a graph with this
shape, it usually represents variables that have an inverse
relationship, like gas volume and pressure.

In the 1700s and 1800s, hot air balloons were very popular. Why wouldn’t
they be? Riding in a hot air balloon allowed people to travel through
the air and get a bird’s eye view of the landscape at a time when
airplanes did not yet exist. Do you know why hot air can inflate a
balloon? Read on to find out.

### Up, Up, and Away {#3.html#x-ck12-VXAsIFVwLCBhbmQgQXdheQ.._25-hwp}

The popularity of hot air balloons got scientists thinking about gases
and what happens to them when they heat up. In the early 1800s, two
French scientists—Jacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussac—decided to
investigate how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of
space it takes up, or its volume. They heated air and measured how its
volume changed. The two scientists already knew that the pressure of a
gas affects it volume. This had been demonstrated back in the 1660s by
the English scientist Robert Boyle. So Charles and Gay-Lussac controlled
the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments.

Based on the results of the research, Charles developed a scientific law
about gases. It is one of three well-known gas laws, the others being
Boyle’s law and Amontons’ law. According to **Charles’ law** , when the
pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing its temperature increases
its volume. The opposite is also true: decreasing the temperature of a
gas decreases it volume.

### You Try It! {#3.html#x-ck12-WW91IFRyeSBJdCE._25-sds}

At the URL below, you can simulate Charles’ and Gay-Lussac’s work. The
simulation lets you choose different temperatures for a gas and see how
it affects the volume of the gas. After you have recorded several sets
of values in the data table, use the graphing feature to plot the
points.

[http://group.chem.iastate.edu/Greenbowe/sections/projectfolder/flashfiles/gaslaw/charles\_law.html](charles_law.html)

**Q:** What does the graph of the data look like?

**A:** The graph is a straight line that rises from left to right. This
type of graph shows that both variables increase together at a constant
rate.

**Q:** Could you use the graph to find the volume of a gas at a
temperature you didn’t choose for your data table?

**A:** Yes, you could. You could find the temperature on the temperature
scale, trace straight up from this point to the graph line, and then
trace straight across to the volume scale to find the volume for that
temperature.

### Amazing Motion {#3.html#x-ck12-QW1hemluZyBNb3Rpb24._25-75y}

Can you guess why the volume of a gas increases when it is heated?
Heating a gas gives its particles more energy. With more energy, the
particles move faster. You can see this in the simulation at the URL
below. Drag the bar to increase the temperature, and you’ll be amazed at
how fast the particles zigzag around inside the box! If the speedy
particles had more room, they would spread out and the volume of the gas
would increase.
[http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/bec/temperature.html](temperature.html)

**Q:** Now that you know how a gas behaves when it is heated, can you
explain how hot air causes a balloon to inflate?

**A:** As the air heats, its particles spread out and occupy more space,
causing the balloon to inflate.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-qpw}

-   According to Charles’ law, when the pressure of a gas is held
    constant, increasing its temperature increases its volume.
-   Heating a gas gives its particles more energy so they move faster.

Lawrence checked the air pressure in one of his tires before driving to
school on a cold winter day. The tire pressure gauge registered 32
pounds of force per square inch. After making the 10-mile trip to
school, Lawrence checked the air pressure again. This time the gauge
registered 34 pounds of force per square inch. Lawrence didn’t add any
air to the tire in between the two measurements, so why did air pressure
in the tire increase?

### Keep on Rolling {#3.html#x-ck12-S2VlcCBvbiBSb2xsaW5n_26-l3a}

There was no additional air in the tire the second time Lawrence checked
the air pressure, but something did change between the two measurements.
The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school. Any
time one surface moves over another, it causes friction. Friction is a
force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching, and
friction between two surfaces always generates heat. Quickly rub your
hands together and you’ll feel the heat generated by the friction
between them. As the tires moved over the road, friction between the
tires and road generated heat. In short, the tires got warmer and so did
the air inside them.

### It’s the Law! {#3.html#x-ck12-SXTigJlzIHRoZSBMYXch_26-dua}

The space inside a car tire is more-or-less fixed, so it has a constant
volume. What happens when the volume of air is constant and its
temperature increases? Lawrence found out the answer to that question
when he measured the air pressure in his tire. Increasing the
temperature of a gas such as air, while holding its volume constant,
increases the pressure of the gas. This relationship between temperature
and pressure of a gas is called **Amontons' law** . It was first
proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late
1600s. Amontons’ gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws.
The other two are Boyle’s law and Charles’ law.

**Q:** How does Amontons' gas law explain the difference in air pressure
in Lawrence’s tire?

**A:** The tire—and the air inside it—got warmer because of friction
with the road. The volume of air inside the tire was more-or-less
constant, so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer.

### Particle Pressure {#3.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljbGUgUHJlc3N1cmU._26-s0v}

Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer? Particles of
a gas are constantly moving and bumping into things. The force of the
collisions is measured by pressure. Pressure is the amount of force
exerted on a given area, such as pounds of force per square inch. When
gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This causes
more collisions and greater pressure. Therefore, heating particles of
gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase.
Explore the behavior of gas particles at different temperatures at the
following URL. Change the temperature of the gas and watch what happens
to its particles.

[http://www.chm.davidson.edu/vce/kineticmoleculartheory/PT.html](PT.html)

**Q:** Look at the graph in the simulation above as you change the
temperature of the gas. What happens to the pressure of the gas as its
temperature increases?

**A:** In the graph, the pressure of the gas increases as its
temperature increases.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-tl1}

-   According to Amontons’ law, increasing the temperature of a gas
    while holding its volume constant increases the pressure of the gas.
-   When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This
    increases their collisions with each other and their container,
    causing greater pressure.

What could this hilly blue surface possibly be? Do you have any idea?
The answer is a single atom of the element Cobalt. The picture was
created using a scanning tunneling microscope. No other microscope can
make images of things as small as atoms. How small are atoms? You will
find out in this lesson.

### What Are Atoms? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQXRvbXM__27-ojp}

**Atoms** are the building blocks of matter. They are the smallest
particles of an element that still have the element’s properties.
Elements, in turn, are pure substances—such as nickel, hydrogen, and
helium—that make up all kinds of matter. All the atoms of a given
element are identical in that they have the same number of protons, one
of the building blocks of atoms (see below). They are also different
from the atoms of all other elements, as atoms of different elements
have different number of protons. For an entertaining introduction to
atoms by Bill Nye the Science Guy, watch the video at this URL:

### Size of Atoms {#3.html#x-ck12-U2l6ZSBvZiBBdG9tcw.._27-qi5}

Unlike bricks, atoms are extremely small. The radius of an atom is well
under 1 nanometer, which is one-billionth of a meter. If a size that
small is hard to imagine, consider this: trillions of atoms would fit
inside the period at the end of this sentence. Although all atoms are
very small, elements vary in the size of their atoms. The **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQXRvbWljLVNpemU.) compares the sizes of
atoms of more than 40 different elements. The elements in the figure are
represented by chemical symbols, such as H for hydrogen and He for
helium. Of course, real atoms are much smaller than the circles
representing them in the **Figure**

**Q:** Which element in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQXRvbWljLVNpemU.) has the biggest atoms?

**A:** The element in the figure with the biggest atoms is cesium (Cs).

### Subatomic Particles {#3.html#x-ck12-U3ViYXRvbWljIFBhcnRpY2xlcw.._27-ch1}

Although atoms are very tiny, they consist of even smaller particles.
Three main types of particles that make up all atoms are:

-   protons, which have a positive electric charge.
-   electrons, which have a negative electric charge.
-   neutrons, which are neutral in electric charge.

The model in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGVsaXVt)
shows how these particles are arranged in an atom. The particular atom
represented by the model is helium, but the particles of all atoms are
arranged in the same way. At the center of the atom is a dense area
called the nucleus, where all the protons and neutrons are clustered
closely together. The electrons constantly move around the nucleus.
Helium has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus and two electrons
moving around the nucleus. Atoms of other elements have different
numbers of subatomic particles, but the number of protons always equals
the number of electrons. This makes atoms neutral in charge because the
positive and negative charges “cancel out.”

**Q:** All atoms of carbon have six protons. How many electrons do
carbon atoms have?

**A:** Carbon atoms must have six electrons to “cancel out” the positive
charges of the six protons. That’s because atoms are always neutral in
electric charge.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-vrx}

-   Atoms are the building blocks of matter. They are the smallest
    particles of an element that still have the element’s properties.
-   All atoms are very small, but atoms of different elements vary
    in size.
-   Three main types of particles that make up all atoms are protons,
    neutrons, and electrons.

An atomic bomb explodes and generates a huge mushroom cloud. The
tremendous energy released when the bomb explodes is incredibly
destructive. Where does all the energy come from? The answer is the
nucleus of the atom.  

### At the Heart of It All {#3.html#x-ck12-QXQgdGhlIEhlYXJ0IG9mIEl0IEFsbA.._28-vxu}

The **nucleus** (plural, nuclei) is a positively charged region at the
center of the atom. It consists of two types of subatomic particles
packed tightly together. The particles are protons, which have a
positive electric charge, and neutrons, which are neutral in electric
charge. Outside of the nucleus, an atom is mostly empty space, with
orbiting negative particles called electrons whizzing through it. The
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfTnVjbGV1cw..) shows these
parts of the atom.

### Size and Mass of the Nucleus {#3.html#x-ck12-U2l6ZSBhbmQgTWFzcyBvZiB0aGUgTnVjbGV1cw.._28-1vc}

The nucleus of the atom is extremely small. Its radius is only about
1/100,000 of the total radius of the atom. If an atom were the size of a
football stadium, the nucleus would be about the size of a pea! You can
see another sports analogy comparing the size of the nucleus and atom at
this URL:

Electrons have virtually no mass, but protons and neutrons have a lot of
mass for their size. As a result, the nucleus has virtually all the mass
of an atom. Given its great mass and tiny size, the nucleus is very
dense. If an object the size of a penny had the same density as the
nucleus of an atom, its mass would be greater than 30 million tons! You
can learn more about the size and mass of the nucleus at this URL:

### Holding It All Together {#3.html#x-ck12-SG9sZGluZyBJdCBBbGwgVG9nZXRoZXI._28-esv}

Particles with opposite electric charges attract each other. This
explains why negative electrons orbit the positive nucleus. Particles
with the same electric charge repel each other. This means that the
positive protons in the nucleus push apart from one another. So why
doesn’t the nucleus fly apart? An even stronger force—called the strong
nuclear force—holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. You
can learn more about these forces in the nucleus by watching the video
at this URL:

**Q:** Can you guess why an atomic bomb releases so much energy when it
explodes?

**A:** When an atomic bomb explodes, the nuclei of atoms undergo a
process called fission, in which they split apart. This releases the
huge amount of energy that was holding together subatomic particles in
the nucleus.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._28-mgx}

-   The nucleus is a small, dense region at the center of the atom. It
    consists of positive protons and neutral neutrons, so it has an
    overall positive charge.
-   The nucleus is just a tiny part of the atom, but it contains
    virtually all of the atom’s mass.
-   The strong nuclear force holds together protons and neutrons in the
    nucleus and overcomes the electric force of repulsion
    between protons.

This glowing sphere represents the sun, which has a diameter of 1.4 × 10
^9^ meters. The sun has a special relationship to another object that is
only about 1.7 × 10 ^-17^ meters in diameter—the subatomic particle
called the proton. How is the gigantic sun related to the extremely tiny
proton? Read on to find out.

### What Is a Proton? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFByb3Rvbj8._29-zb7}

A **proton** is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The
other two particles are the neutron and electron. Protons are found in
the nucleus of the atom. This is a tiny, dense region at the center of
the atom. Protons have a positive electrical charge of one (+1) and a
mass of 1 atomic mass unit (amu), which is about 1.67 × 10 ^-27^
kilograms. Together with neutrons, they make up virtually all of the
mass of an atom. For an excellent video on protons and other fundamental
particles in atoms, go to this URL:

**Q:** How do you think the sun is related to protons?

**A:** The sun’s tremendous energy is the result of proton interactions.
In the sun, as well as in other stars, protons from hydrogen atoms
combine, or fuse, to form nuclei of helium atoms. This fusion reaction
releases a huge amount of energy and takes place in nature only at the
extremely high temperatures of stars such as the sun.

### Identical Protons, Different Elements {#3.html#x-ck12-SWRlbnRpY2FsIFByb3RvbnMsIERpZmZlcmVudCBFbGVtZW50cw.._29-bx4}

All protons are identical. For example, hydrogen protons are exactly the
same as protons of helium and all other elements, or pure substances.
However, atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons.
In fact, atoms of any given element have a unique number of protons that
is different from the numbers of protons of all other elements. For
example, a hydrogen atom has just one proton, whereas a helium atom has
two protons. The number of protons in an atom determines the electrical
charge of the nucleus. The nucleus also contains neutrons, but they are
neutral in charge. The one proton in a hydrogen nucleus, for example,
gives it a charge of +1, and the two protons in a helium nucleus give it
a charge of +2. To learn more about the relationship between protons and
elements, go to this URL:

**Q:** There are six protons in each atom of carbon. What is the
electrical charge of a carbon nucleus?

**A:** The electrical charge of a carbon nucleus is +6.

### What Are Protons Made of? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgUHJvdG9ucyBNYWRlIG9mPw.._29-lsj}

Protons are made of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. As
you can see in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUXVhcmtz) ,
a proton contains three quarks (colored circles) and three streams of
gluons (wavy white lines). Two of the quarks are called up quarks (u),
and the third quark is called a down quark (d). The gluons carry the
strong nuclear force between quarks, binding them together. This force
is needed to overcome the electric force of repulsion between positive
protons. Although protons were discovered almost 100 years ago, the
quarks and gluons inside them were discovered much more recently.
Scientists are still learning more about these fundamental particles.

The arrow in this photo is pointing to a star that doesn’t look like
much compared with some of the other stars in the picture. It’s
certainly much smaller than most other stars. In fact, it’s only about
20 kilometers in diameter. Compare that with the 1.4-million-kilometer
diameter of our own sun. Despite its small size, however, this star has
greater mass than the sun, making it incredibly dense. It also has
tremendous gravity. In fact, gravity on its surface is about 2 × 10 ^11^
times the gravity we feel on Earth! What type of star is it? It’s called
a neutron star. That’s because it consists solely of neutrons. You can

### What Is a Neutron? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIE5ldXRyb24__30-amk}

A **neutron** is one of three main particles that make up the atom. The
other two particles are the proton and electron. Atoms of all
elements—except for most atoms of hydrogen—have neutrons in their
nucleus. The nucleus is the small, dense region at the center of an atom
where protons are also found. Atoms generally have about the same number
of neutrons as protons. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons
and most also have six neutrons. A model of a carbon atom is shown in
the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FyYm9u) . For an

### Properties of Neutrons {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBOZXV0cm9ucw.._30-khz}

Unlike protons and electrons, which are electrically charged, neutrons
have no charge. In other words, they are electrically neutral. That’s
why the neutrons in the diagram above are labeled n ^0^ . The zero
stands for “zero charge.” The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than
the mass of a proton, which is 1 atomic mass unit (amu). (An atomic mass
unit equals about 1.67 × 10 ^-27^ kilograms.) A neutron also has about
the same diameter as a proton, or 1.7 × 10 ^-17^ meters.

### Same Element, Different Numbers of Neutrons {#3.html#x-ck12-U2FtZSBFbGVtZW50LCBEaWZmZXJlbnQgTnVtYmVycyBvZiBOZXV0cm9ucw.._30-km1}

All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and
electrons. The number of neutrons, however, may vary for atoms of the
same element. For example, almost 99 percent of carbon atoms have six
neutrons, but the rest have either seven or eight neutrons. Atoms of an
element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
The nuclei of these isotopes of carbon are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8yXzRfSXNvdG9wZXM.) . The isotope
called carbon-14 is used to find the ages of fossils. You can learn how

**Q:** Notice the names of the carbon isotopes in the diagram. Based on
this example, infer how isotopes of an element are named.

**A:** Isotopes of an element are named for their total number of
protons and neutrons.

**Q:** The element oxygen has 8 protons. How many protons and neutrons
are there in oxygen-17?

**A:** Oxygen-17—like all atoms of oxygen—has 8 protons. Its name
provides the clue that it has a total of 17 protons and neutrons.
Therefore, it must have 9 neutrons (8 + 9 = 17).

### Particles in Neutrons {#3.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljbGVzIGluIE5ldXRyb25z_30-upr}

Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons.
Each neutron contains three quarks, as shown in the diagram below. Two
of the quarks are called down quarks (d) and the third quark is called
an up quark (u). Gluons (represented by wavy black lines in the diagram)
are fundamental particles that are given off or absorbed by quarks. They
carry the strong nuclear force that holds together quarks in a neutron.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-pg2}

-   A neutron is one of three main particles that make up the atom. It
    is found in the nucleus and is neutral in electric charge. It has
    about the same mass and diameter as a proton. Neutrons are found in
    all atoms except for most atoms of hydrogen.
-   All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons and
    electrons, but they may vary in their numbers of neutrons. Atoms of
    the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are
    called isotopes.
-   Neutrons consist of fundamental particles known as quarks
    and gluons. Gluons carry the strong nuclear force that binds
    together the quarks in a neutron.

Watch out! Lightning is extremely dangerous. A single bolt of lightning
can carry a billion volts of electricity. That’s enough energy to light
a 100-watt light bulb—for three months! As impressive as it is,
lightning is nothing more than a sudden flow of extremely tiny
particles. What are the particles that flow in a lightning bolt? The
answer is electrons.

### What Are Electrons? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgRWxlY3Ryb25zPw.._31-wtu}

**Electrons** are one of three main types of particles that make up
atoms. The other two types are protons and neutrons. Unlike protons and
neutrons, which consist of smaller, simpler particles, electrons are
fundamental particles that do not consist of smaller particles. They are
a type of fundamental particles called leptons. All leptons have an
electric charge of -1 or 0. For an excellent video about electrons and
other fundamental particles in atoms, go to this URL:

### Properties of Electrons {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBFbGVjdHJvbnM._31-baw}

Electrons are extremely small. The mass of an electron is only about
1/2000 the mass of a proton or neutron, so electrons contribute
virtually nothing to the total mass of an atom. Electrons have an
electric charge of -1, which is equal but opposite to the charge of
proton, which is +1. All atoms have the same number of electrons as
protons, so the positive and negative charges “cancel out,” making atoms
electrically neutral.

### Where Are Electrons? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgQXJlIEVsZWN0cm9ucz8._31-zps}

Unlike protons and neutrons, which are located inside the nucleus at the
center of the atom, electrons are found outside the nucleus. Because
opposite electric charges attract each other, negative electrons are
attracted to the positive nucleus. This force of attraction keeps
electrons constantly moving through the otherwise empty space around the
nucleus. The **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMi0yLTUtQXRvbQ..)
is a common way to represent the structure of an atom. It shows the
electron as a particle orbiting the nucleus, similar to the way that
planets orbit the sun.

### Orbitals {#3.html#x-ck12-T3JiaXRhbHM._31-e87}

The atomic model in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMi0yLTUtQXRvbQ..) is useful for some
purposes, but it’s too simple when it comes to the location of
electrons. In reality, it’s impossible to say what path an electron will
follow. Instead, it’s only possible to describe the chances of finding
an electron in a certain region around the nucleus. The region where an
electron is most likely to be is called an orbital. Each orbital can
have at most two electrons. Some orbitals, called S orbitals, are shaped
like spheres, with the nucleus in the center. An S orbital is pictured
in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMi0wMi0wNS1PcmJpdGFsLWRlbnNpdHk.) .
Where the dots are denser, the chance of finding an electron is greater.
Also pictured in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMi0wMi0wNS1PcmJpdGFsLWRlbnNpdHk.) is
a P orbital. P orbitals are shaped like dumbbells, with the nucleus in
the pinched part of the dumbbell. You can see animated,
three-dimensional models of orbitals at the following URL.

**Q:** How many electrons can there be in each type of orbital shown in
the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1QUy0wMi0wMi0wNS1PcmJpdGFsLWRlbnNpdHk.) ?

**A:** There can be a maximum of two electrons in any orbital,
regardless of its shape.

**Q:** Where is the nucleus in each orbital?

**A:** The nucleus is at the center of each orbital. It is in the middle
of the sphere in the S orbital and in the pinched part of the P orbital.

### What’s Your Energy Level? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgWW91ciBFbmVyZ3kgTGV2ZWw__31-o7x}

Electrons are located at fixed distances from the nucleus, called energy
levels. You can see the first three energy levels in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMi0yLTUtRW5lcmd5LUxldmVscw..) . The
diagram also shows the maximum possible number of electrons at each
energy level.

-   Electrons at lower energy levels, which are closer to the nucleus,
    have less energy. At the lowest energy level, which has the least
    energy, there is just one orbital, so this energy level has a
    maximum of two electrons.
-   Only when a lower energy level is full are electrons added to the
    next higher energy level. Electrons at higher energy levels, which
    are farther from the nucleus, have more energy. They also have more
    orbitals and greater possible numbers of electrons.
-   Electrons at the outermost energy level of an atom are called
    valence electrons. They determine many of the properties of
    an element. That’s because these electrons are involved in chemical
    reactions with other atoms. Atoms may share or transfer
    valence electrons. Shared electrons bind atoms together to form
    chemical compounds.

You can see all of these ideas in action at the following URL (scroll
down to the animation at the bottom of the Web page).

**Q:** If an atom has 12 electrons, how will they be distributed in
energy levels?

**A:** The atom will have two electrons at the first energy level, eight
at the second energy level, and the remaining two at the third energy
level.

**Q:** Sometimes, an electron jumps from one energy level to another.
How do you think this happens?

**A:** To change energy levels, an electron must either gain or lose
energy. That’s because electrons at higher energy levels have more
energy than electrons at lower energy levels.

Who says scientists don’t have a sense of humor? Look at the odd names
and images in this chart. Do you have any idea what they represent?
Would it surprise you to learn that they represent the most fundamental
particles of matter? In fact, particles with funny names like charm
quarks and strange quarks make up all the matter in the universe. For an

### The Search for Fundamental Particles {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNlYXJjaCBmb3IgRnVuZGFtZW50YWwgUGFydGljbGVz_32-1cj}

Scientists have long wanted to find the most basic building blocks of
the universe. They asked, “what are the **fundamental particles** of
matter that cannot be subdivided into smaller, simpler particles,” and
“what holds these particles together?” The quest for fundamental
particles began thousands of years ago. Scientists thought they had
finally found them when John Dalton discovered the atom in 1803 (see the
timeline in **Table** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dGltZWxpbmU.) ).
The word atom means “indivisible,” and Dalton thought that the atom
could not be divided into smaller, simpler particles.

**Click on the image above to view the table**

</div>

For almost 100 years after Dalton discovered atoms, they were accepted
as the fundamental particles of matter. But starting in the late 1890s
with the discovery of electrons, particles smaller and simpler than
atoms were identified. Within a few decades, protons and neutrons were
also discovered. Ultimately, hundreds of subatomic particles were found.
You can learn how such tiny particles are discovered by watching the
video at this URL:

### Leptons and Quarks and Bosons, Oh My! {#3.html#x-ck12-TGVwdG9ucyBhbmQgUXVhcmtzIGFuZCBCb3NvbnMsIE9oIE15IQ.._32-9kx}

Today, scientists think that electrons truly are fundamental particles
that cannot be broken down into smaller, simpler particles. They are a
type of fundamental particles called leptons. Protons and neutrons, on
the other hand, are no longer thought to be fundamental particles.
Instead, they are now thought to consist of smaller, simpler particles
of matter called quarks. Scientists theorize that leptons and quarks are
held together by yet another type of fundamental particles called
bosons. All three types of fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, and
bosons—are described below. The following **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnVuZGFtZW50YWwtUGFydGljbGVz) shows the
variety of particles of each type.

-   There are six types of **quarks** . In ordinary matter, virtually
    all quarks are of the types called up and down quarks. All quarks
    have mass, and they have an electric charge of either +2/3 or -1/3.
    For example, up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and down quarks have a
    charge of -1/3. Quarks also have a different type of charge, called
    color charge, although it has nothing to do with the colors that
    we see. Quarks are never found alone but instead always occur in
    groups of two or three quarks.
-   There are also six types of leptons, including electrons. Leptons
    have an electric charge of either -1 or 0. Electrons, for example,
    have a charge of -1. Leptons have mass, although the mass of
    electrons is extremely small.
-   There are four known types of bosons, which are
    force-carrying particles. Each of these bosons carries a different
    fundamental force between interacting particles. In addition, there
    is a particle which may exist, called the "Higgs Boson", which gives
    objects the masses they have. Some types of bosons have mass; others
    are massless. Bosons have an electric charge of +1, -1, or 0.

**Q:** Protons consist of three quarks: two up quarks and one down
quark. Neutrons also consist of three quarks: two down quarks and one up
quark. Based on this information, what is the total electric charge of a
proton? Of a neutron?

**A:** These combinations of quarks give protons a total electric charge
of +1 (2/3 + 2/3 – 1/3 = 1) and neutrons a total electric charge of 0
(2/3 – 1/3 – 1/3 = 0).

### Force-Carrying Particles {#3.html#x-ck12-Rm9yY2UtQ2FycnlpbmcgUGFydGljbGVz_32-i4p}

The interactions of matter particles are subject to four fundamental
forces: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, and strong
nuclear force. All of these forces are thought to be transmitted by
bosons, the force-carrying fundamental particles. The different types of
bosons and the forces they carry are shown in **Table**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZnVuZGFtZW50YWxmb3JjZXM.) . Consider the
examples of gluons, the bosons that carry the strong nuclear force. A
continuous exchange of gluons between quarks binds them together in both
protons and neutrons. Note that force-carrying particles for gravity
(gravitons) have not yet been found.

:  Bosons and Fundamental Forces

**Q:** Which type of boson carries force between the negative electrons
and positive protons of an atom?

**A:** Photons carry electromagnetic force. They are responsible for the
force of attraction or repulsion between all electrically charged
matter, including the force of attraction between negative electrons and
positive protons in an atom.

**Q:** Gravitons have not yet been discovered so they have only been
hypothesized to exist. What evidence do you think leads scientists to
think that these hypothetical particles affect both leptons and quarks
and that they carry force over all distances?

**A:** Gravity is known to affect all matter that has mass, and both
quarks and leptons have mass. Gravity is also known to work over long as
well as short distances. For example, Earth’s gravity keeps you firmly
planted on the ground and also keeps the moon orbiting around the
planet.

### The Standard Model {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN0YW5kYXJkIE1vZGVs_32-xwj}

Based on their knowledge of subatomic particles, scientists have
developed a theory called the **standard model** to explain all the
matter in the universe and how it is held together. The model includes
only the fundamental particles in the **Table**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZnVuZGFtZW50YWxmb3JjZXM.) . No other
particles are needed to explain all kinds of matter. According to the
model, all known matter consists of quarks and leptons that interact by
exchanging bosons, which transmit fundamental forces. The standard model
is a good theory because all of its predictions have been verified by
experimental data. However, the model doesn’t explain everything,
including the force of gravity and why matter has mass. Scientists
continue to search for evidence that will allow them to explain these
aspects of force and matter as well. You can learn much more about the
standard model at the URL below. Click on “the standard model” and
follow the sequence titled “What is fundamental?”

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._32-hkz}

-   For centuries, scientists searched for the fundamental particles of
    matter and the “glue” that holds them together. At first, scientists
    thought that atoms were the fundamental particles. Now they know
    that there are smaller, simpler particles than atoms that make up
    matter and carry the forces that hold matter together.
-   Protons and neutrons are made up of fundamental particles of matter
    called quarks. Electrons are another type of fundamental particles
    of matter called leptons. Bosons are fundamental particles that
    carry forces between fundamental particles of matter.
-   Scientists think that a different type of boson carries each of the
    four fundamental forces in the universe (strong and weak nuclear
    forces, electromagnetic force, and gravity).
-   The standard model is a simple theory that explains all the matter
    in the universe and its interactions (except for the mass of matter
    and the force of gravity). According to the standard model, all
    known matter consists of quarks and leptons, which interact by
    exchanging force-carrying particles called bosons.

You’ve probably used items like those pictured here. What do all of them
have in common? They are all used to hold things together. However, they
do so in different ways. Like these different kinds of fasteners, there
are different kinds of “fasteners” that hold together the subatomic
particles inside atoms. The “fasteners” are called forces, and there are
three different kinds of them at work inside the atom: electromagnetic
force, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force. For an introduction
to these forces inside the atom, see the colorful tutorial at this URL:
[http://www.ric.edu/faculty/ptiskus/Atomic\_Force/]() .

### Electromagnetic Force {#3.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIEZvcmNl_33-wgh}

Electromagnetic force is a force of attraction or repulsion between all
electrically charged particles. This force is transferred between
charged particles of matter by fundamental force-carrying particles
called photons. Because of electromagnetic force, particles with
opposite charges attract each other and particles with the same charge
repel each other.

Inside the atom, two types of subatomic particles have electric charge:
electrons, which have an electric charge of -1, and protons, which have
an opposite but equal electric charge of +1. The model of an atom in the
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcmdlcw..) shows both types
of charged particles. Protons are found inside the nucleus at the center
of the atom, and they give the nucleus a positive charge. (There are
also neutrons in the nucleus, but they have no electric charge.)
Negative electrons stay in the area surrounding the positive nucleus
because of the electromagnetic force of attraction between them.

</div>

**Q:** Why do you think protons cluster together in the nucleus of the
atom instead of repelling each other because of their like charges?

**A:** The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positively charged
protons is overcome by a stronger force, called the strong nuclear
force.

### Strong Nuclear Force {#3.html#x-ck12-U3Ryb25nIE51Y2xlYXIgRm9yY2U._33-1sj}

The strong nuclear force is a force of attraction between fundamental
particles called quarks, which have a type of charge called color
charge. The strong nuclear force is transferred between quarks by
fundamental force-carrying particles called gluons. Both protons and
neutrons consist of quarks. The exchange of gluons holds quarks together
within a proton or neutron. Excess, or residual, strong force holds
together protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The strong nuclear force
is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force of repulsion
pushing protons apart. Both forces are represented in the **Figure**

**Figure 3.66**

The types of quarks found in protons and neutrons are called up quarks
(u) and down quarks (d). Each proton consists of two up quarks and one
down quark (uud), and each neutron consists of one up quark and two down
quarks (udd). This diagram represents two protons.

The strong nuclear force works only over very short distances. As a
result, it isn’t effective if the nucleus gets too big. As more protons
are added to the nucleus, the electromagnetic force of repulsion between
them gets stronger, while the strong nuclear force of attraction between
them gets weaker. This puts an upper limit on the number of protons an
atom can have and remain stable. If atoms have more than 83 protons, the
electromagnetic repulsion between them is greater than the strong
nuclear force of attraction between them. This makes the nucleus
unstable, or radioactive, so it breaks down. The following video
discusses the strong nuclear force and its role in the atom. The video
also introduces the weak nuclear force, which is described next.

### Weak Nuclear Force {#3.html#x-ck12-V2VhayBOdWNsZWFyIEZvcmNl_33-4si}

The weak nuclear force is transferred by the exchange of force-carrying
fundamental particles called W and Z bosons. This force is also a very
short-range force that works only within the nucleus of the atom. It is
much weaker than the strong force or electromagnetic force that are also
at work inside the atom. Unlike these other two forces, the weak nuclear
force does not bind subatomic particles together in an atom. Instead, it
changes subatomic particles from one type to another. The **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtV2Vhay1Gb3JjZQ..) shows one way this can
happen. In this figure, an up quark in a proton is changed by the weak
force to a down quark. This changes the proton (uud) to a neutron (udd).

**Q:** If the weak force causes a proton to change to a neutron, how
does this change the atom?

**A:** The resulting atom represents a different element. That’s because
each element has a unique number of protons. For example, all atoms of
helium have two protons. If one of the protons in a helium atom changes
to a neutron, the resulting atom would have just one proton, so the atom
would no longer be a helium atom. Instead it would be a hydrogen atom,
because all hydrogen atoms have a single proton.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-ea8}

-   The electromagnetic force of attraction between negative electrons
    and positive protons in the nucleus keeps electrons in the area
    surrounding the nucleus.
-   The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positive protons in
    the nucleus is overcome by the strong nuclear force between protons
    and neutrons. This force holds the nucleus together.
-   The weak nuclear force changes subatomic particles from one type
    to another. When protons change to neutrons, this changes atoms of
    one element to atoms of a different element.

Athletes wearing the same-colored jerseys are all on the same team. In
addition, each player’s jersey has a unique number to distinguish him
from his teammates. Imagine how confusing it would be if members of both
teams wore the same-colored jerseys or all the members of a team had the
same number on their jerseys. How could you tell the athletes apart?

### Telling Atoms Apart {#3.html#x-ck12-VGVsbGluZyBBdG9tcyBBcGFydA.._34-y8e}

It’s often useful to have ways to signify different people or objects
like athletes on teams. The same is true of atoms. It’s important to be
able to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of other elements.
Elements are pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one
is given a unique name. The names of elements are also represented by
unique one- or two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon,
and He for helium. You can see other examples in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQmxhY2stUGVyaW9kaWMtVGFibGU.) .

</div>

**Q:** The table shown in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQmxhY2stUGVyaW9kaWMtVGFibGU.) is called
the periodic table of the elements. Each symbol stands for a different
element. What do you think the symbol K stands for?

**A:** The symbol K stands for the element potassium. The symbol comes
from the Latin name for potassium, which is *kalium* .

The symbols in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQmxhY2stUGVyaW9kaWMtVGFibGU.) would be
more useful if they revealed more information about the atoms they
represent. For example, it would be useful to know the numbers of
protons and neutrons in the atoms. That’s where atomic number and mass
number come in.

### Atomic Number {#3.html#x-ck12-QXRvbWljIE51bWJlcg.._34-k9p}

The number of protons in an atom is called its **atomic number** . This
number is very important because it is unique for atoms of a given
element. All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, and
every element has a different number of protons in its atoms. For
example, all helium atoms have two protons, and no other elements have
atoms with two protons. In the case of helium, the atomic number is 2.
The atomic number of an element is usually written in front of and
slightly below the element’s symbol, like in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfSGVsaXVt) for helium.

<div id="3.html#x-ck12-YWQ1ZGJiY2UyNDMwYjMxNDQ0NzcwYmUxNDhkNDM4ZTE.-t8z"

helium](ck12_3_files/20150911012337869306.png "Atomic and mass number of helium")

**Figure 3.69**

</div>

Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number
of negative electrons as positive protons. Therefore, the atomic number
of an atom also tells you how many electrons the atom has. This, in
turn, determines many of the atom’s properties.

### Mass Number {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFzcyBOdW1iZXI._34-678}

There is another number in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfSGVsaXVt) for helium. That number is the
**mass number** , which is the mass of the atom in a unit called the
**atomic mass unit (amu)** . One atomic mass unit is the mass of a
proton, or about 1.67 × 10 ^-27^ kilograms, which is an extremely small
mass. To better appreciate how small an atomic mass unit is, go to this
URL:
[http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic\_table/atomic\_mass.html](atomic_mass.html)
.

A neutron has just a tiny bit more mass than a proton, so its mass is
often assumed to be one atomic mass unit as well. Because electrons have
virtually no mass, just about all the mass of an atom is in its protons
and neutrons. Therefore, the total number of protons and neutrons in an
atom determines its mass in atomic mass units.

Consider helium again. Most helium atoms have two neutrons in addition
to two protons. Therefore the mass of most helium atoms is 4 atomic mass
units (2 amu for the protons + 2 amu for the neutrons). However, some
helium atoms have more or less than two neutrons. Atoms with the same
number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Because the number of neutrons can vary for a given element, the mass
numbers of different atoms of an element may also vary. For example,
some helium atoms have three neutrons instead of two. Therefore, they
have a different mass number than the one given in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfSGVsaXVt) .

**Q:** What is the mass number of a helium atom that has three neutrons?

**A:** The mass number is the number of protons plus the number of
neutrons. For helium atoms with three neutrons, the mass number is 2
(protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 5.

**Q:** How would you represent this isotope of helium to show its atomic
number and mass number?

**A:** You would represent it by the element’s symbol and both numbers,
with the mass number on top and the atomic number on the bottom:

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._34-ago}

-   Elements are pure substances that make up all matter, so each one is
    given a unique name. The names of elements are also represented by
    unique one-, two-, or three- letter symbols.
-   The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. This
    is also unique for each element.
-   An atom’s mass number is its mass in atomic mass units (amu), which
    is about equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in
    the atom. Different isotopes of an element have different mass
    numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons.

The incredible green lights in this cold northern sky consist of charged
particles known as ions. Their swirling pattern is caused by the pull of
Earth’s magnetic north pole. Called the northern lights, this phenomenon
of nature shows that ions respond to a magnetic field. Do you know what
ions are? Read on to find out.

### Atoms Are Neutral {#3.html#x-ck12-QXRvbXMgQXJlIE5ldXRyYWw._35-o3e}

The northern lights aren’t caused by atoms, because atoms are not
charged particles. An atom always has the same number of electrons as
protons. Electrons have an electric charge of -1 and protons have an
electric charge of +1. Therefore, the charges of an atom’s electrons and
protons “cancel out.” This explains why atoms are neutral in electric
charge.

**Q:** What would happen to an atom’s charge if it were to gain extra
electrons?

**A:** If an atom were to gain extra electrons, it would have more
electrons than protons. This would give it a negative charge, so it
would no longer be neutral.

### Atoms to Ions {#3.html#x-ck12-QXRvbXMgdG8gSW9ucw.._35-lmq}

Atoms cannot only gain extra electrons. They can also lose electrons. In
either case, they become **ions** . Ions are atoms that have a positive
or negative charge because they have unequal numbers of protons and
electrons. If atoms lose electrons, they become positive ions, or
cations. If atoms gain electrons, they become negative ions, or anions.
Consider the example of fluorine (see **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmxvdXJpbmVJb24.) ). A fluorine atom has
nine protons and nine electrons, so it is electrically neutral. If a
fluorine atom gains an electron, it becomes a fluoride ion with an
electric charge of -1.

ion](ck12_3_files/20150911012338127631.png "Fluorine atom turning into fluoride ion")

**Figure 3.70**

</div>

### Names and Symbols {#3.html#x-ck12-TmFtZXMgYW5kIFN5bWJvbHM._35-nx7}

Like fluoride, other negative ions usually have names ending in *–ide* .
Positive ions, on the other hand, are just given the element name
followed by the word *ion* . For example, when a sodium atom loses an
electron, it becomes a positive sodium ion. The charge of an ion is
indicated by a plus (+) or minus sign (-), which is written to the right
of and just above the ion’s chemical symbol. For example, the fluoride
ion is represented by the symbol F ^-^ , and the sodium ion is
represented by the symbol Na ^+^ . If the charge is greater than one, a
number is used to indicate it. For example, iron (Fe) may lose two
electrons to form an ion with a charge of plus two. This ion would be
represented by the symbol Fe ^2+^ . This and some other common ions are
listed with their symbols in the **Table**

  :  Some Common Ions

**Q:** How does the iron(III) ion differ from the iron(II) ion?

**A:** The iron(III) ion has a charge of +3, so it has one less electron
than the iron(II) ion, which has a charge of +2.

**Q:** What is the charge of an oxide ion? How does its number of
electrons compare to its number of protons?

**A:** An oxide ion has a charge of -2. It has two more electrons than
protons.

### How Ions Form {#3.html#x-ck12-SG93IElvbnMgRm9ybQ.._35-izh}

The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization. It may
occur when atoms are exposed to high levels of radiation. The radiation
may give their outer electrons enough energy to escape from the
attraction of the positive nucleus. However, most ions form when atoms
transfer electrons to or from other atoms or molecules. For example,
sodium atoms may transfer electrons to chlorine atoms. This forms
positive sodium ions (Na ^+^ ) and negative chloride ions (Cl ^-^ ). You
can see an animation of this process at the URL below.

**Q:** Why do you think atoms lose electrons to, or gain electrons from,
other atoms?

**A:** Atoms form ions by losing or gaining electrons because it makes
them more stable and this state takes less energy to maintain. The most
stable state for an atom is to have its outermost energy level filled
with the maximum possible number of electrons. In the case of metals
such as lithium, with just one electron in the outermost energy level, a
more stable state can be achieved by losing that one outer electron. In
the case of nonmetals such as fluorine, which has seven electrons in the
outermost energy level, a more stable state can be achieved by gaining
one electron and filling up the outer energy level. You can learn more
about why ions form by watching the video at this URL:

### Properties of Ions {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBJb25z_35-izq}

Ions are highly reactive, especially as gases. They usually react with
ions of opposite charge to form neutral compounds. For example, positive
sodium ions and negative chloride ions react to form the neutral
compound sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt. This occurs
because oppositely charged ions attract each other. Ions with the same
charge, on the other hand, repel each other. Ions are also deflected by
a magnetic field, as you saw in the opening image of the northern
lights.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._35-cms}

-   Atoms have equal numbers of positive protons and negative electrons,
    so they are neutral in electric charge.
-   Atoms can gain or lose electrons and become ions, which are atoms
    that have a positive or negative charge because they have unequal
    numbers of protons and electrons.
-   The process in which an atom becomes an ion is called ionization. It
    may occur when atoms are exposed to high levels of radiation or when
    atoms transfer electrons to or from other atoms.
-   Ions are reactive, attracted or repulsed by other charged particles,
    and deflected by a magnetic field.

Is this creature a space alien? It may look alien, but the sketch is
actually just a scientist wearing a special suit to protect himself from
harmful radiation. The scientist is working with radioactive chemicals
called isotopes. Not all isotopes are radioactive, but many of them are.
To understand why, you first need to know what isotopes are.

### What Are Isotopes? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgSXNvdG9wZXM__36-h7a}

All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but some
may have different numbers of neutrons. For example, all carbon atoms
have six protons, and most have six neutrons as well. But some carbon
atoms have seven or eight neutrons instead of the usual six. Atoms of
the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called
**isotopes** . Many isotopes occur naturally. Usually one or two
isotopes of an element are the most stable and common. Different
isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical
properties. That’s because they have the same numbers of protons and
electrons. For a video explanation of isotopes, go to this URL:

### An Example: Hydrogen Isotopes {#3.html#x-ck12-QW4gRXhhbXBsZTogSHlkcm9nZW4gSXNvdG9wZXM._36-dtt}

Hydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes. Three isotopes
of hydrogen are modeled in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfSXNvdG9wZXM.) . Most hydrogen atoms have
just one proton and one electron and lack a neutron. These atoms are
just called hydrogen. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well.
These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other hydrogen atoms have
two neutrons. These atoms are the isotope named tritium. For animated

For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass
number. For example, carbon atoms with the usual 6 neutrons have a mass
number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12), so they are called
carbon-12. Carbon atoms with 7 neutrons have an atomic mass of 13 (6
protons + 7 neutrons = 13). These atoms are the isotope called
carbon-13.

**Q:** Some carbon atoms have 8 neutrons. What is the name of this
isotope of carbon?

**A:** Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons have an atomic mass of 14 (6 protons
+ 8 neutrons = 14), so this isotope of carbon is named carbon-14.

### Stability of Isotopes {#3.html#x-ck12-U3RhYmlsaXR5IG9mIElzb3RvcGVz_36-sfm}

Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a stable
nucleus. Having too many or too few neutrons relative to protons results
in an unstable, or radioactive, nucleus that will sooner or later break
down to a more stable form. This process is called radioactive decay.
Many isotopes have radioactive nuclei, and these isotopes are referred
to as radioisotopes. When they decay, they release particles that may be
harmful. This is why radioactive isotopes are dangerous and why working
with them requires special suits for protection. The isotope of carbon
known as carbon-14 is an example of a radioisotope. In contrast, the
carbon isotopes called carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._36-u6x}

-   Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons
    are called isotopes. Different isotopes of an element generally have
    the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same
    numbers of protons and electrons.
-   Most hydrogen atoms lack a neutron and are just called hydrogen.
    Hydrogen atoms with one neutron are the isotope known as deuterium,
    and those with two neutrons are the isotope named tritium.
-   For most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their
    mass number, which is the number of protons plus neutrons. For
    example, carbon with a mass number of 14 is called carbon-14.
-   Atoms need a certain ratio of neutrons to protons to have a
    stable nucleus. If they have too many or too few neutrons relative
    to protons, they are radioactive and will decay to more
    stable forms. Isotopes with radioactive nuclei are
    called radioisotopes.

The man shown above has been called the “laughing philosopher” because
of his cheerful disposition. He certainly looks cheerful in this
picture. Why is a philosopher featured in a science text? He made an
amazing contribution to science, although it was ridiculed by others and
then ignored for more than 2000 years. His name was Democritus, and he
introduced the idea of the atom as the basic building block of all
matter. You can learn about Democritus’ place in the history of the atom

### Cutting the Cheese {#3.html#x-ck12-Q3V0dGluZyB0aGUgQ2hlZXNl_37-bh6}

Democritus lived in Greece from about 460 to 370 B.C.E. Like many other
ancient Greek philosophers, he spent a lot of time wondering about the
natural world. Democritus wondered, for example, what would happen if
you cut a chunk of matter—such as a piece of cheese into smaller and
smaller pieces. He thought that a point would be reached at which the
cheese could not be cut into still smaller pieces. He called these
pieces *atomos* , which means “uncuttable” in Greek. This is where the
modern term *atom* comes from. In the video at the following URL, Bill
Nye the Science Guy demonstrates how Democritus arrived at his idea of
the atom.

### Just a Guess {#3.html#x-ck12-SnVzdCBhIEd1ZXNz_37-udp}

Democritus’ idea of the atom has been called “the best guess in
antiquity.” That’s because it was correct in many ways, yet it was based
on pure speculation. It really was just a guess. Here’s what Democritus
thought about the atom:

-   All matter consists of atoms, which cannot be further subdivided
    into smaller particles.
-   Atoms are extremely small—too small to see.
-   Atoms are solid particles that are indestructible.
-   Atoms are separated from one another by emptiness, or “void.”

**Q:** How are Democritus’ ideas about atoms similar to modern ideas
about atoms?

**A:** Modern ideas agree that all matter is made up of extremely small
building blocks called atoms.

**Q:** How are Democritus’ ideas different from modern ideas?

**A:** Although atoms are extremely small, it is now possible to see
them with very powerful microscopes. Atoms also aren’t the solid,
uncuttable particles Democritus thought. Instead, they consist of
several kinds of smaller, simpler particles as well as a lot of empty
space. In addition, atoms aren’t really indestructible because they can
be changed to other forms of matter or energy.

### Keep on Moving {#3.html#x-ck12-S2VlcCBvbiBNb3Zpbmc._37-mz6}

Did you ever notice dust motes moving in still air where a beam of
sunlight passes through it? You can see an example in the forest scene
in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfU3VubGlnaHQ.) . This
sort of observation gave Democritus the idea that atoms are in constant,
random motion. If this were true, Democritus thought, then atoms must
always be bumping into each other. When they do, he surmised, they
either bounce apart or stick together to form clumps of atoms.
Eventually, the clumps could grow big enough to be visible matter.

</div>

**Q:** Which modern theory of matter is similar to Democritus’ ideas
about the motion of atoms?

**A:** The modern kinetic theory of matter is remarkably similar to
Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms. According to this theory,
atoms of matter are in constant random motion. This motion is greater in
gases than in liquids, and it is greater in liquids than in solids. But
even in solids, atoms are constantly vibrating in place.

### Why Matter Varies {#3.html#x-ck12-V2h5IE1hdHRlciBWYXJpZXM._37-arp}

Democritus thought that different kinds of matter vary because of the
size, shape, and arrangement of their atoms. For example, he suggested
that sweet substances are made of smooth atoms and bitter substances are
made of sharp atoms. He speculated that atoms of liquids are slippery,
which allows them to slide over each other and liquids to flow. Atoms of
solids, in contrast, stick together, so they cannot move apart.
Differences in the weight of matter, he argued, could be explained by
the closeness of atoms. Atoms of lighter matter, he thought, were more
spread out and separated by more empty space.

**Q:** Democritus thought that different kinds of atoms make up
different types of matter. How is this similar to modern ideas about
atoms?

**A:** The modern view is that atoms of different elements differ in
their numbers of protons and electrons and this gives them different
physical and chemical properties.

### That’s Ridiculous! {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhhdOKAmXMgUmlkaWN1bG91cyE._37-0ci}

Democritus was an important philosopher, but he was less influential
than another Greek philosopher named Aristotle, who lived about 100
years after Democritus. Aristotle rejected Democritus’ idea of the atom.
In fact, Aristotle thought the idea was ridiculous. Unfortunately,
Aristotle’s opinion was accepted for more than 2000 years, and
Democritus’ idea was more or less forgotten. However, the idea of the
atom was revived around 1800 by the English scientist John Dalton.
Dalton developed an entire theory about the atom, much of which is still
accepted today. He based his theory on experimental evidence, not on
lucky guesses.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._37-orq}

-   Around 400 B.C.E., the Greek philosopher Democritus introduced the
    idea of the atom as the basic building block matter.
-   Democritus thought that atoms are tiny, uncuttable, solid particles
    that are surrounded by empty space and constantly moving at random.
-   Democritus surmised that different kinds of matter consist of
    different types or arrangements of atoms.

You probably know what this sketch represents. It’s a model of an atom,
one of the miniscule particles that make up all matter. The idea that
matter consists of extremely tiny particles called atoms was first
introduced about 2500 years ago by a Greek philosopher named Democritus.
However, other philosophers considered Democritus’ idea ridiculous, and
it was more or less forgotten for more than 2000 years.

### Reintroducing the Atom {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVpbnRyb2R1Y2luZyB0aGUgQXRvbQ.._38-crq}

Around 1800, the English chemist John Dalton brought back Democritus’
ancient idea of the atom. You can see a picture of Dalton
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGFsdG9u) . Dalton grew up in a
working-class family. As an adult, he made a living by teaching and just
did research in his spare time. Nonetheless, from his research he
developed one of the most important theories in all of science. Based on
his research results, he was able to demonstrate that atoms actually do
exist, something that Democritus had only guessed.

### Dalton’s Experiments {#3.html#x-ck12-RGFsdG9u4oCZcyBFeHBlcmltZW50cw.._38-uxk}

Dalton did many experiments that provided evidence for the existence of
atoms. For example:

-   He investigated pressure and other properties of gases, from which
    he inferred that gases must consist of tiny, individual particles
    that are in constant, random motion.
-   He researched the properties of compounds, which are substances that
    consist of more than one element. He showed that a given compound is
    always comprised of the same elements in the same whole-number ratio
    and that different compounds consist of different elements
    or ratios. This can happen, Dalton reasoned, only if elements are
    made of separate, discrete particles that cannot be subdivided.

### Atomic Theory {#3.html#x-ck12-QXRvbWljIFRoZW9yeQ.._38-5qm}

From his research, Dalton developed a theory about atoms. Dalton’s
atomic theory consists of three basic ideas:

-   All substances are made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest particles
    of matter. They cannot be divided into smaller particles, created,
    or destroyed.
-   All atoms of the same element are alike and have the same mass.
    Atoms of different elements are different and have different masses.
-   Atoms join together to form compounds, and a given compound always
    consists of the same kinds of atoms in the same proportions.

Dalton’s atomic theory was accepted by many scientists almost
immediately. Most of it is still accepted today. However, scientists now
know that atoms are not the smallest particles of matter. Atoms consist
of several types of smaller particles, including protons, neutrons, and
electrons. For the back story on Dalton’s ideas about atoms and his
place in the history of the atom, watch this video:

### The Billiard Ball Model {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJpbGxpYXJkIEJhbGwgTW9kZWw._38-q9a}

Because Dalton thought atoms were the smallest particles of matter, he
envisioned them as solid, hard spheres, like billiard (pool) balls, so
he used wooden balls to model them. Three of his model atoms are
pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGFsdG9uLUF0b21z) . Do you see the holes
in the balls? Dalton added these so the model atoms could be joined
together with hooks and used to model compounds.

You probably know that the wires strung between these high towers carry
electricity. But do you know what electricity is? It actually consists
of a constant stream of tiny particles called electrons. Electrons are
negatively charged fundamental particles inside atoms. Atoms were
discovered around 1800, but almost 100 years went by before electrons
were discovered.  

### Thomson Discovers Electrons {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhvbXNvbiBEaXNjb3ZlcnMgRWxlY3Ryb25z_39-5o1}

John Dalton discovered atoms in 1804. He thought they were the smallest
particles of matter, which could not be broken down into smaller
particles. He envisioned them as solid, hard spheres. It wasn’t until
1897 that a scientist named Joseph John (J. J.) Thomson discovered that
there are smaller particles within the atom. Thomson was born in England
and studied at Cambridge University, where he later became a professor.
In 1906, he won the Nobel Prize in physics for his research on how gases
conduct electricity. This research also led to his discovery of the
electron. You can see a picture of Thomson
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGhvbXBzb24.) . You can take a museum
tour of his discovery at this online exhibit:

### Thomson’s Experiments {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhvbXNvbuKAmXMgRXhwZXJpbWVudHM._39-sut}

In his research, Thomson passed current through a cathode ray tube,
similar to the one seen in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2F0aG9kZVR1YmU.) . A cathode ray tube is
a glass tube from which virtually all of the air has been removed. It
contains a piece of metal called an electrode at each end. One electrode
is negatively charged and known as a cathode. The other electrode is
positively charged and known as an anode. When high-voltage electric
current is applied to the end plates, a cathode ray travels from the
cathode to the anode.

What is a cathode ray? That’s what Thomson wanted to know. Is it just a
ray of energy that travels in waves like a ray of light? That was one
popular hypothesis at the time. Or was a cathode ray a stream of moving
particles? That was the other popular hypothesis. Thomson tested these
ideas by placing negative and positive plates along the sides of the
cathode ray tube to see how the cathode ray would be affected. The
cathode ray appeared to be repelled by the negative plate and attracted
by the positive plate. This meant that the ray was negative in charge
and that is must consist of particles that have mass. He called the
particles “corpuscles,” but they were later renamed electrons. For a
video demonstration of Thomson’s experiment, go to this URL:

**Figure 3.77**

</div>

Thomson also measured the mass of the particles he had identified. He
did this by determining how much the cathode rays were bent when he
varied the voltage. He found that the mass of the particles was 2000
times smaller than the mass of the smallest atom, the hydrogen atom. In
short, Thomson had discovered the existence of particles smaller than
atoms. This disproved Dalton’s claim that atoms are the smallest
particles of matter. From his discovery, Thomson also inferred that
electrons are fundamental particles within atoms.

**Q:** Atoms are neutral in electric charge. How can they be neutral if
they contain negatively charged electrons?

**A:** Atoms also contain positively charged particles that cancel out
the negative charge of the electrons. However, these positive particles
weren’t discovered until a couple of decades after Thomson discovered
electrons.

### The Plum Pudding Model {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsdW0gUHVkZGluZyBNb2RlbA.._39-vqh}

Thomson also knew that atoms are neutral in electric charge, so he asked
the same question: How can atoms contain negative particles and still be
neutral? He hypothesized that the rest of the atom must be positively
charged in order to cancel out the negative charge of the electrons. He
envisioned the atom as being similar to a plum pudding, like the one
pictured in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVkZGluZ3M.)
—mostly positive in charge (the pudding) with negative electrons (the
plums) scattered through it.

**Q:** How is our modern understanding of atomic structure different
from Thomson’s plum pudding model?

**A:** Today we know that all of the positive charge in an atom is
concentrated in a tiny central area called the nucleus, with the
electrons swirling through empty space around it, as in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQXRvbXM.) . The nucleus was discovered
just a few years after Thomson discovered the electron, so the plum
pudding model was soon rejected.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._39-5h2}

-   In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the first subatomic particle, the
    electron, while researching cathode rays.
-   To explain the neutrality of atoms, Thomson proposed a model of the
    atom in which negative electrons are scattered throughout a sphere
    of positive charge. He called his atom the plum pudding model.

Thom is shooting baskets. He’s trying to hit the backboard so the ball
will bounce off it and into the basket. If only the backboard was
bigger! It would be a lot easier to hit. If the ball misses the
backboard, it will just keep going and Thom will have to run after it.
Believe it or not, the research that led to the discovery of the nucleus
of the atom was a little like shooting baskets.  

### Narrowing Down the Nucleus {#3.html#x-ck12-TmFycm93aW5nIERvd24gdGhlIE51Y2xldXM._40-oty}

In 1804, almost a century before the nucleus was discovered, the English
scientist John Dalton provided evidence for the existence of the atom.
Dalton thought that atoms were the smallest particles of matter, which
couldn't be divided into smaller particles. He modeled atoms with solid
wooden balls. In 1897, another English scientist, named J. J. Thomson,
discovered the electron. It was first subatomic particle to be
identified. Because atoms are neutral in electric charge, Thomson
assumed that atoms must also contain areas of positive charge to cancel
out the negatively charged electrons. He thought that an atom was like a
plum pudding, consisting mostly of positively charged matter with
negative electrons scattered through it.

The nucleus of the atom was discovered next. It was discovered in 1911
by a scientist from New Zealand named Ernest Rutherford, who is pictured
in **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUnV0aGVyZm9yZA..) . Through
his clever research, Rutherford showed that the positive charge of an
atom is confined to a tiny massive region at the center of the atom,
rather than being spread evenly throughout the “pudding” of the atom as
Thomson had suggested. You can watch a video about Rutherford and his
discovery at this URL:

### Go for the Gold! {#3.html#x-ck12-R28gZm9yIHRoZSBHb2xkIQ.._40-04w}

The way Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus is a good example of
the role of creativity in science. His quest actually began in 1899 when
he discovered that some elements give off positively charged particles
that can penetrate just about anything. He called these particles alpha
(α) particles (we now know they were helium nuclei). Like all good
scientists, Rutherford was curious. He wondered how he could use alpha
particles to learn about the structure of the atom. He decided to aim a
beam of alpha particles at a sheet of very thin gold foil. He chose gold
because it can be pounded into sheets that are only 0.00004 cm thick.
Surrounding the sheet of gold foil, he placed a screen that glowed when
alpha particles struck it. It would be used to detect the alpha
particles after they passed through the foil. A small slit in the screen
allowed the beam of alpha particles to reach the foil from the particle
emitter. You can see the setup for Rutherford’s experiment in the
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR29sZEZvaWw.) .

**Q:** What would you expect to happen when the alpha particles strike
the gold foil?

**A:** The alpha particles would penetrate the gold foil. Alpha
particles are positive, so they might be repelled by any areas of
positive charge inside the gold atoms.

foil](ck12_3_files/20150911012340509232.png "Rutherford's experiment of shooting alpha particles at gold foil")

**Figure 3.81**

</div>

Assuming a plum pudding model of the atom, Rutherford predicted that the
areas of positive charge in the gold atoms would deflect, or bend, the
path of all the alpha particles as they passed through. You can see what
really happened in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR29sZEZvaWw.) . Most of the alpha
particles passed straight through the gold foil as though it wasn’t
there. The particles seemed to be passing through empty space. Only a
few of the alpha particles were deflected from their straight path, as
Rutherford had predicted. Surprisingly, a tiny percentage of the
particles bounced back from the foil like a basketball bouncing off a
backboard! You can see an animation of this experiment at the following
URL:
[http://www.clickandlearn.org/gr9\_sci/atoms/modelsoftheatom.html](modelsoftheatom.html)
.

**Q:** What can you infer from these observations?

**A:** You can infer that most of the alpha particles were not repelled
by any positive charge, whereas a few were repelled by a strong positive
charge.

### The Nucleus Takes Center Stage {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE51Y2xldXMgVGFrZXMgQ2VudGVyIFN0YWdl_40-dpl}

Rutherford made the same inferences. He concluded that all of the
positive charge and virtually all of the mass of an atom are
concentrated in one tiny area and the rest of the atom is mostly empty
space. Rutherford called the area of concentrated positive charge the
nucleus. He predicted—and soon discovered—that the nucleus contains
positively charged particles, which he named protons. Rutherford also
predicted the existence of neutral nuclear particles called neutrons,
but he failed to find them. However, his student James Chadwick
discovered them several years later. You can learn how at this URL:
[http://www.light-science.com/chadwick.html](chadwick.html) .

### The Planetary Model {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsYW5ldGFyeSBNb2RlbA.._40-l5y}

Rutherford’s discoveries meant that Thomson’s plum pudding model was
incorrect. Positive charge is not spread evenly throughout an atom.
Instead, it is all concentrated in the tiny nucleus. The rest of the
atom is empty space except for the electrons scattered through it. In
Rutherford’s model of the atom, which is shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGxhbmV0YXJ5TW9kZWw.) , the electrons
move around the massive nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. That’s
why his model is called the planetary model. Rutherford didn’t know
exactly where or how electrons orbit the nucleus. That research would be
undertaken by later scientists, beginning with Niels Bohr in 1913. New
and improved atomic models would also be developed. Nonetheless,
Rutherford’s model is still often used to represent the atom. You can
see an animated version of the model at this URL:

on one rung or another, but you can never stand in between two rungs. A

to find out.  

### Modeling the Atom {#3.html#x-ck12-TW9kZWxpbmcgdGhlIEF0b20._41-kif}

The existence of the atom was first demonstrated around 1800 by John
Dalton. Then, close to a century went by before J.J. Thomson discovered
the first subatomic particle, the negatively charged electron. Because
atoms are neutral in charge, Thomson thought that they must consist of a
sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered through it. In 1910,
Ernest Rutherford showed that this idea was incorrect. He demonstrated
that all of the positive charge of an atom is actually concentrated in a
tiny central region called the nucleus. Rutherford surmised that
electrons move around the nucleus like planets around the sun.
Rutherford’s idea of atomic structure was an improvement on Thomson’s
model, but it wasn’t the last word. Rutherford focused on the nucleus
and didn’t really clarify where the electrons were in the empty space
surrounding the nucleus.

The next major advance in atomic history occurred in 1913, when the
Danish scientist Niels Bohr published a description of a more detailed
model of the atom. His model identified more clearly where electrons
could be found. Although later scientists would develop more refined
atomic models, Bohr’s model was basically correct and much of it is
still accepted today. It is also a very useful model because it explains
the properties of different elements. Bohr received the 1922 Nobel prize
in physics for his contribution to our understanding of the structure of
the atom. You can see a picture of Bohr

### On the Level {#3.html#x-ck12-T24gdGhlIExldmVs_41-xsb}

As a young man, Bohr worked in Rutherford’s lab in England. Because
Rutherford’s model was weak on the position of the electrons, Bohr
focused on them. He hypothesized that electrons can move around the
nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of
energy they have. He called these fixed distances energy levels, or
electron shells. He thought of them as concentric spheres, with the
nucleus at the center of each sphere. In other words, the shells
consisted of sphere within sphere within sphere. Furthermore, electrons
with less energy would be found at lower energy levels, closer to the
nucleus. Those with more energy would be found at higher energy levels,
farther from the nucleus. Bohr also hypothesized that if an electron
absorbed just the right amount of energy, it would jump to the next
higher energy level. Conversely, if it lost the same amount of energy,
it would jump back to its original energy level. However, an electron
could never exist in between two energy levels. These ideas are
illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm9ockF0b20.) .

This is a two-dimensional model of a three-dimensional atom. The
concentric circles actually represent concentric spheres.

**Q:** How is an atom like a ladder?

**A:** Energy levels in an atom are like the rungs of a ladder. Just as
you can stand only on the rungs and not in between them, electrons can
orbit the nucleus only at fixed distances from the nucleus and not in
between them.

### Energy by the Spoonful {#3.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IGJ5IHRoZSBTcG9vbmZ1bA.._41-zm1}

Bohr’s model of the atom is actually a combination of two different
ideas: Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons orbiting the nucleus and
German scientist Max Planck’s idea of a quantum, which Planck published
in 1901. A **quantum** (plural, quanta) is the minimum amount of energy
that can be absorbed or released by matter. It is a discrete, or
distinct, amount of energy. If energy were water and you wanted to add
it to matter in the form of a drinking glass, you couldn’t simply pour
the water continuously into the glass. Instead, you could add it only in
small fixed quantities, for example, by the teaspoonful. Bohr reasoned
that if electrons can absorb or lose only fixed quantities of energy,
then they must vary in their energy by these fixed amounts. Thus, they
can occupy only fixed energy levels around the nucleus that correspond
to quantum increases in energy.

**Q:** The idea that energy is transferred only in discrete units, or
quanta, was revolutionary when Max Planck first proposed it in 1901.
However, what scientists already knew about matter may have made it
easier for them to accept the idea of energy quanta. Can you explain?

**A:** Scientists already knew that matter exists in discrete units
called atoms. This idea had been demonstrated by John Dalton around
1800. Knowing this may have made it easier for scientists to accept the
idea that energy exists in discrete units as well.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._41-ev4}

-   In Bohr’s atomic model, electrons move around the nucleus only at
    fixed distances from the nucleus based on the amount of energy
    they have. The fixed distances where electrons may orbit are called
    energy levels.
-   Bohr arrived at his model by applying Planck’s idea of energy quanta
    to Rutherford’s atomic model of electrons orbiting the nucleus.

Fireworks are a great way to celebrate happy events. Do you know what
causes the brilliant, colored lights of fireworks? The lights are bursts
of energy given off by atoms in the fireworks. What do you suppose
causes these bursts of light? The answer has to do with energy levels of
atoms.

### What Are Energy Levels? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgRW5lcmd5IExldmVscz8._42-q7o}

**Energy levels** (also called electron shells) are fixed distances from
the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be found. Electrons are tiny,
negatively charged particles in an atom that move around the positive
nucleus at the center. Energy levels are a little like the steps of a
staircase. You can stand on one step or another but not in between the
steps. The same goes for electrons. They can occupy one energy level or
another but not the space between energy levels.

The model in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW5lcmd5TGV2ZWxz) shows the first four
energy levels of an atom. Electrons in energy level I (also called
energy level K) have the least amount of energy. As you go farther from
the nucleus, electrons at higher levels have more energy, and their
energy increases by a fixed, discrete amount. Electrons can jump from a
lower to the next higher energy level if they absorb this amount of
energy. Conversely, if electrons jump from a higher to a lower energy
level, they give off energy, often in the form of light. This explains
the fireworks pictured above. When the fireworks explode, electrons gain
energy and jump to higher energy levels. When they jump back to their
original energy levels, they release the energy as light. Different
atoms have different arrangements of electrons, so they give off light
of different colors. You can see an animation of electrons jumping from
one energy level to another at this URL:

**Q:** In the atomic model **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW5lcmd5TGV2ZWxz) , where would you find
electrons that have the most energy?

**A:** Electrons with the most energy would be found in energy level IV.

### Energy Levels and Orbitals {#3.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IExldmVscyBhbmQgT3JiaXRhbHM._42-wxn}

The smallest atoms are hydrogen atoms. They have just one electron
orbiting the nucleus. That one electron is in the first energy level.
Bigger atoms have more electrons. Electrons are always added to the
lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons
possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until
that level is full, and so on.

How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of
electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the
**Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW5lcmd5TGV2ZWxz) . For
example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy
level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number
depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is
a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be
found. As you can see by the images in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtT3JiaXRhbHM.) , some orbitals are shaped
like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P
orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well.

**Figure 3.86**

</div>

Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two
electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will
fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes
eight electrons to fill this energy level. The animation below shows the
electrons in the first two energy levels for an atom of lithium, which
has a total of three electrons.

[http://web.visionlearning.com/custom/chemistry/animations/CHE1.3-an-lithium.shtml](CHE1.3-an-lithium.shtml)

**Q:** Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many
orbitals does this energy level have?

**A:** At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine
orbitals.

### The Outermost Level {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE91dGVybW9zdCBMZXZlbA.._42-lk6}

Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom have a special
significance. These electrons are called valence electrons, and they
determine many of the properties of an atom. An atom is most stable if
its outermost energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold.
For example, helium has two electrons, both in the first energy level.
This energy level can hold only two electrons, so helium’s only energy
level is full. This makes helium a very stable element. In other words,
its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms.

Consider the elements fluorine and lithium, modeled in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGl0aGl1bUZsb3VyaW5l) . Fluorine has
seven of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level, which
is energy level II. It would be more stable if it had one more electron
because this would fill its outermost energy level. Lithium, on the
other hand, has just one of eight possible electrons in its outermost
energy level (also energy level II). It would be more stable if it had
one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level (now
energy level I).

Both fluorine and lithium are highly reactive elements because of their
number of valence electrons. Fluorine will readily gain one electron and
lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable.
In fact, lithium and fluorine will react together as shown in the
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVhY3Rpb24.) . When the two
elements react, lithium transfers its one “extra” electron to fluorine.

**Q:** A neon atom has ten electrons. How many electrons does it have in
its outermost energy level? How stable do you think a neon atom is?

**A:** A neon atom has two electrons in energy level I and its remaining
eight electrons in energy level II, which can hold only eight electrons.
This means that is outermost energy level is full. Therefore, a neon
atom is very stable.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._42-ksi}

-   Energy levels (also called electron shells) are fixed distances from
    the nucleus of an atom where electrons may be found. As you go
    farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher energy levels have
    more energy.
-   Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it
    has the maximum number of electrons possible, and then electrons are
    added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and
    so on. The maximum number of electrons at a given energy level
    depends on its number of orbitals. There are at most two electrons
    per orbital.
-   Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom are called
    valence electrons. They determine many of the properties of an atom,
    including how reactive it is.

The fan pictured here is turned off in the photo on the left and running
at high speed in the photo on the right. In the right-hand photo, the
blades are moving too fast for you to see the individual blades. You
can’t tell where any given blade is at any given moment. In some ways,
rapidly moving fan blades are similar to electrons moving about the
nucleus of an atom. Like fan blades, electrons move very quickly and we
can never tell exactly where they are. If that’s the case, how can we
represent electrons in models of the atom?

### Where Are the Electrons? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgQXJlIHRoZSBFbGVjdHJvbnM__43-9ub}

Up until about 1920, scientists accepted Niels Bohr’s model of the atom.
In this model, negative electrons circle the positive nucleus at fixed
distances from the nucleus, called energy levels. You can see the model
in **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMgUFMgMiAyIDE3IE5pdHJvZ2Vu) for
an atom of the element nitrogen. Bohr’s model is useful for
understanding properties of elements and their chemical interactions.
However, it doesn’t explain certain behaviors of electrons, except for
those in the simplest atom, the hydrogen atom.

### What Are the Chances? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgdGhlIENoYW5jZXM__43-k3y}

In the mid-1920s, an Austrian scientist named Erwin Schrödinger thought
that the problem with Bohr’s model was restricting the electrons to
specific orbits. He wondered if electrons might behave like light, which
scientists already knew had properties of both particles and waves.
Schrödinger speculated that electrons might also travel in waves. At the
URLs below, you can see how some of these waves might look.

-   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Drum\_vibration\_mode13.gif](File:Drum_vibration_mode13.gif)
-   [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Drum\_vibration\_mode23.gif](File:Drum_vibration_mode23.gif)

**Q:** How do you pin down the location of an electron in a wave?

**A:** You can’t specify the exact location of an electron. However,
Schrödinger showed that you can at least determine where an electron is
most likely to be.

Schrödinger developed an equation that could be used to calculate the
chances of an electron being in any given place around the nucleus.
Based on his calculations, he identified regions around the nucleus
where electrons are most likely to be. He called these regions
**orbitals** . As you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQXRvbWljTW9kZWw.) , orbitals may be
shaped like spheres, dumbbells, or rings. In each case, the nucleus of
the atom is at the center of the orbital. You can see animated models of
orbitals this URL:

### A Fuzzy Cloud {#3.html#x-ck12-QSBGdXp6eSBDbG91ZA.._43-34g}

Schrödinger’s work on orbitals is the basis of the modern model of the
atom, which scientists call the quantum mechanical model. The modern
model is also commonly called the **electron cloud** model. That’s
because each orbital around the nucleus of the atom resembles a fuzzy
cloud around the nucleus, like the ones shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxlY3Ryb25DbG91ZA..) for a helium atom.
The densest area of the cloud is where the electrons have the greatest
chances of being.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._43-3tz}

-   Bohr’s model of the atom, in which electrons circle the nucleus at
    fixed energy levels, cannot explain all the behaviors of electrons.
-   In the 1920s, Erwin Schrödinger proposed that electrons travel in
    waves, which means their exact positions cannot be determined. He
    developed an equation to calculate the chances of an electron being
    in any given place. Using his equation, he identified regions around
    the nucleus, called orbitals, where electrons are most likely to be.
-   Orbitals are the basis of the electron cloud model of the atom. This
    model is still accepted by scientists today.

specific item of clothing. If you don’t have a messy closet, just

**Q:** What do these two closets have to do with science?

**A:** They show why it’s important to keep things organized, including
the elements, which are the pure substances that make up all kinds of
matter.

### Organizing Elements {#3.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5pemluZyBFbGVtZW50cw.._44-oe9}

For many years, scientists looked for a good way to organize the
elements. This became increasingly important as more and more elements
were discovered. An ingenious method of organizing elements was
developed in 1869 by a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev, who is
pictured [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWVuZGVsZWV2) . Mendeleev’s
method of organizing elements was later revised, but it served as a
basis for the method that is still used today. You can learn more about
Mendeleev and his work at this URL:

**Figure 3.92**

</div>

Mendeleev was a teacher as well as a chemist. He was writing a chemistry
textbook and wanted to find a way to organize the 63 known elements so
it would be easier for students to learn about them. He made a set of
cards of the elements, similar to a deck of playing cards. On each card,
he wrote the name of a different element, its atomic mass, and other
known properties. Mendeleev arranged and rearranged the cards in many
different ways, looking for a pattern. He finally found it when he
placed the elements in order by increasing atomic mass.

**Q:** What is atomic mass? Why might it be a good basis for organizing
elements?

**A:** Atomic mass is the mass of one atom of an element. It is about
equal to the mass of the protons plus the neutrons in an atom. It is a
good basis for organizing elements because each element has a unique
number of protons and atomic mass is an indirect way of organizing
elements by number of protons.

### Groups and Periods {#3.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXBzIGFuZCBQZXJpb2Rz_44-z2j}

You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfTWVuZGVsZWV2VGFibGU.) . From left to
right across each row, elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass.
Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and
then continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would
contain elements with similar properties. He called the columns
**groups** . They are sometimes called families, because elements within
a group are similar but not identical to one another, like people in a
family.

**Figure 3.93**

</div>

Mendeleev’s table of the elements is called a **periodic table** because
of its repeating pattern. Anything that keeps repeating is referred to
as periodic. Other examples of things that are periodic include the
monthly phases of the moon and the daily cycle of night and day. The
term *period* refers to the interval between repetitions. For example,
the moon’s phases repeat every four weeks. In a periodic table of the
elements, the **periods** are the rows of the table. In Mendeleev’s
table, each period contains eight elements, and then the pattern repeats
in the next row.

### Filling in the Blanks {#3.html#x-ck12-RmlsbGluZyBpbiB0aGUgQmxhbmtz_44-uz5}

Did you notice the blanks in Mendeleev’s table? They are spaces that
Mendeleev left blank for elements that had not yet been discovered when
he created his table. He predicted that these missing elements would
eventually be discovered. Based on their position in the table, he even
predicted their properties. For example, he predicted a missing element
in row 5 of group III. He also predicted that the missing element would
have an atomic mass of 68 and be a relatively soft metal like other
elements in this group. Scientists searched for the missing element, and
they found it just a few years later. They named the new element
gallium. Scientists searched for the other missing elements in
Mendeleev’s table and eventually found all of them.

An important measure of a good model is its ability to make accurate
predictions. This makes it a useful model. Clearly, Mendeleev’s periodic
table was a useful model. It helped scientists discover new elements and
made sense of those that were already known.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._44-y6d}

-   In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev developed a method for organizing elements
    based on their atomic mass. His method was later revised, but it
    served as a basis for the method used today.
-   Mendeleev created a periodic table of all the elements that were
    known at the time. The rows of the table, called periods, each
    contained eight elements that increased in atomic mass from left
    to right. The columns of the table, called groups, contained
    elements with similar properties.
-   Mendeleev’s periodic table was a good model because it could be used
    to predict unknown elements and their properties. All of these
    missing elements were eventually discovered.

### The First Periodic Table {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZpcnN0IFBlcmlvZGljIFRhYmxl_45-rnh}

In the 1860s, a scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev also saw the need to
organize the elements. He created a table in which he arranged all of
the elements by increasing atomic mass from left to right across each
row. When he placed eight elements in each row and then started again in
the next row, each column of the table contained elements with similar
properties. He called the columns of elements groups. Mendeleev’s table
is called a **periodic table** and the rows are called periods. That’s
because the table keeps repeating from row to row, and periodic means
“repeating.”

### The Modern Periodic Table {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1vZGVybiBQZXJpb2RpYyBUYWJsZQ.._45-dt6}

A periodic table is still used today to organize the elements. You can
see a simple version of the modern periodic table in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Nb2Rlcm5QVGFibGU.) .
The modern table is based on Mendeleev’s table, except the modern table
arranges the elements by increasing atomic number instead of atomic
mass. Atomic number is the number of protons in an atom, and this number
is unique for each element. The modern table has more elements than
Mendeleev’s table because many elements have been discovered since
Mendeleev’s time. You can explore an interactive version of the modern
periodic table at this URL: [http://www.ptable.com/]() .

### Reading the Table {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVhZGluZyB0aGUgVGFibGU._45-nig}

In the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Nb2Rlcm5QVGFibGU.) ,
each element is represented by its chemical symbol, which consists of
one or two letters. The first letter of the symbol is always written in
upper case, and the second letter—if there is one—is always written in
lower case. For example, the symbol for copper is Cu. It stands for
*cuprum* , which is the Latin word for copper. The number above each
symbol in the table is its unique atomic number. Notice how the atomic
numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom in the table.

**Q:** Find the symbol for copper in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Nb2Rlcm5QVGFibGU.) .
What is its atomic number? What does this number represent?

**A:** The atomic number of copper is 29. This number represents the
number of protons in each atom of copper. (Copper is the element that
makes up the coil of wire in photo A of the opening sequence of photos.)

### Periods of the Modern Periodic Table {#3.html#x-ck12-UGVyaW9kcyBvZiB0aGUgTW9kZXJuIFBlcmlvZGljIFRhYmxl_45-xno}

Rows of the modern periodic table are called **periods** , as they are
in Mendeleev’s table. From left to right across a period, each element
has one more proton than the element before it. Some periods in the
modern periodic table are longer than others. For example, period 1
contains only two elements: hydrogen (H) and helium (He). In contrast,
periods 6 and 7 are so long that many of their elements are placed below
the main part of the table. They are the elements starting with
lanthanum (La) in period 6 and actinium (Ac) in period 7. Some elements
in period 7 have not yet been named. They are represented by temporary
three-letter symbols, such as Uub. The number of each period represents
the number of energy levels that have electrons in them for atoms of
each element in that period.

**Q:** Find calcium (Ca) in the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Nb2Rlcm5QVGFibGU.) .
How many energy levels have electrons in them for atoms of calcium?

**A:** Calcium is in period 4, so its atoms have electrons in them for
the first four energy levels.

### Groups of the Modern Periodic Table {#3.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXBzIG9mIHRoZSBNb2Rlcm4gUGVyaW9kaWMgVGFibGU._45-aga}

Columns of the modern table are called **groups** , as they are in
Mendeleev’s table. However, the modern table has many more groups—18
compared with just 8 in Mendeleev’s table. Elements in the same group
have similar properties. For example, all elements in group 18 are
colorless, odorless gases, such as neon (Ne). (Neon is the element
inside the light in opening photo C.) In contrast, all elements in group
1 are very reactive solids. They react explosively with water, as you
can see in the video and **Figure**

### Classes of Elements {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NlcyBvZiBFbGVtZW50cw.._45-cqp}

All elements can be classified in one of three classes: metals,
metalloids, or nonmetals. Elements in each class share certain basic
properties. For example, elements in the metals class can conduct
electricity, whereas elements in the nonmetals class generally cannot.
Elements in the metalloids class fall in between the metals and
nonmetals in their properties. An example of a metalloid is arsenic
(As). (Arsenic is the element in opening photo B.) In the periodic table
above, elements are color coded to show their class. As you move from
left to right across each period of the table, the elements change from
metals to metalloids to nonmetals.

**Q:** To which class of elements does copper (Cu) belong: metal,
metalloid, or nonmetal? Identify three other elements in this class.

**A:** In the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Nb2Rlcm5QVGFibGU.) ,
the cell for copper is colored blue. This means that copper belongs to
the metals class. Other elements in the metals class include iron (Fe),
sodium (Na), and gold (Au). It is apparent from the table that the
majority of elements are metals.

table at the URL below. Choose an element from each class and watch the
video about it.

    known elements. Elements are arranged in the table by increasing
    atomic number.
-   In the modern periodic table, each element is represented by its
    chemical symbol. The number above each symbol is its atomic number.
    Atomic numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom in
    the table.
-   Rows of the periodic table are called periods. From left to right
    across a period, each element has one more proton than the element
    before it.
-   Columns of the periodic table are called groups. Elements in the
    same group have similar properties.
-   All elements can be classified in one of three classes: metals,

When you think of metals, do you think of solid objects such as iron
nails and gold jewelry? If so, it might surprise you to learn that the
shiny liquid pouring out of the pipette in the photo above is also a
metal. It’s called mercury, and it’s the only metal that normally exists
on Earth as a liquid. Just what are metals, and what are their
properties? Read on to find out.

### What Are Metals? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTWV0YWxzPw.._46-fb3}

**Metals** are elements that can conduct electricity. They are one of
three classes of elements (the other two classes are nonmetals and
metalloids). Metals are by far the largest of the three classes. In
fact, most elements are metals. All of the elements on the left side and
in the middle of the periodic table, except for hydrogen, are metals.
There are several different types of metals, including alkali metals in
group 1 of the periodic table, alkaline Earth metals in group 2, and
transition metals in groups 3–12. The majority of metals are transition
metals.

### Properties of Metals {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBNZXRhbHM._46-i9g}

Elements in the same class share certain basic similarities. In addition
to conducting electricity, many metals have several other shared
properties, including those listed below. You can dig deeper into the
properties of metals at this URL:
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add\_gateway\_pre\_2011/periodictable/metalsrev1.shtml](metalsrev1.shtml)
.

-   Metals have relatively high melting points. This explains why all
    metals except for mercury are solids at room temperature.
-   Most metals are good conductors of heat. That’s why metals such as
    iron, copper, and aluminum are used for pots and pans.
-   Metals are generally shiny. This is because they reflect much of the
    light that strikes them. The mercury pictured above is very shiny.
-   The majority of metals are ductile. This means that they can be
    pulled into long, thin shapes, like the aluminum electric wires
    pictured in the **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWx1bWludW1fQ29tcG9zaXRl) .
-   Metals tend to be malleable. This means that they can be formed into
    thin sheets without breaking. An example is aluminum foil, also
    pictured in the **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWx1bWludW1fQ29tcG9zaXRl) .

**Q:** The defining characteristic of metals is their ability to conduct
electricity. Why do you think metals have this property?

**A:** The properties of metals—as well as of elements in the other
classes—depend mainly on the number and arrangement of their electrons.

### Explaining the Properties of Metals {#3.html#x-ck12-RXhwbGFpbmluZyB0aGUgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBNZXRhbHM._46-sto}

To understand why metals can conduct electricity, consider the metal
lithium as an example. An atom of lithium is modeled below. Look at
lithium’s electrons. There are two electrons at the first energy level.
This energy level can hold only two electrons, so it is full in lithium.
The second energy level is another story. It can hold a maximum of eight
electrons, but in lithium it has just one. A full outer energy level is
the most stable arrangement of electrons. Lithium would need to gain
seven electrons to fill its outer energy level and make it stable. It’s
far easier for lithium to give up its one electron in energy level 2,
leaving it with a full outer energy level (now level 1). Electricity is
a flow of electrons. Because lithium (like most other metals) easily
gives up its “extra” electron, it is a good conductor of electricity.
This tendency to give up electrons also explains other properties of
metals such as lithium.

The three pure substances pictured above have the distinction of being
among the top ten elements that make up the human body. All three of
them belong to the class of elements called nonmetals. Most of the
elements that comprise the human body—as well as the majority of other
living things—are nonmetals. In fact, seven of the top ten elements in
your own body belong to this class of elements. What do you know about
nonmetals? What are their properties, and how are they different from
other elements? In this article, you’ll find out.

### What Are Nonmetals? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTm9ubWV0YWxzPw.._47-8fs}

**Nonmetals** are elements that generally do not conduct electricity.
They are one of three classes of elements (the other two classes are
metals and metalloids.) Nonmetals are the second largest of the three
classes after metals. They are the elements located on the right side of
the periodic table.

**Q:** From left to right across each period (row) of the periodic
table, each element has atoms with one more proton and one more electron
than the element before it. How might this be related to the properties
of nonmetals?

**A:** Because nonmetals are on the right side of the periodic table,
they have more electrons in their outer energy level than elements on
the left side or in the middle of the periodic table. The number of
electrons in the outer energy level of an atom determines many of its
properties.

### Properties of Nonmetals {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBOb25tZXRhbHM._47-u7r}

As their name suggests, nonmetals generally have properties that are
very different from the properties of metals. Properties of nonmetals
include a relatively low boiling point, which explains why many of them
are gases at room temperature. However, some nonmetals are solids at
room temperature, including the three pictured above, and one
nonmetal—bromine—is a liquid at room temperature. Other properties of
nonmetals are illustrated and described in the **Table**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TVNfUFMtTm9ubWV0YWxz) .

### Reactivity of Nonmetals {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVhY3Rpdml0eSBvZiBOb25tZXRhbHM._47-b2m}

Reactivity is how likely an element is to react chemically with other
elements. Some nonmetals are extremely reactive, whereas others are
completely nonreactive. What explains this variation in nonmetals? The
answer is their number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in
the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in interactions with
other atoms. Let’s look at two examples of nonmetals, fluorine and neon.
Simple atomic models of these two elements are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmx1b3JpbmVOZW9u) .

**Q:** Which element, fluorine or neon, do you predict is more reactive?

**A:** Fluorine is more reactive than neon. That’s because it has seven
of eight possible electrons in its outer energy level, whereas neon
already has eight electrons in this energy level.

<div id="3.html#x-ck12-OWVhZmE1YzA3NDk3NjEzMDdkYmM0MGY3ZmJhYTM2OWI.-xr0"

electrons](ck12_3_files/20150911012344963391.png "Fluorine and neon have different numbers of valence electrons")

**Figure 3.97**

</div>

Although neon has just one more electron than fluorine in its outer
energy level, that one electron makes a huge difference. Fluorine needs
one more electron to fill its outer energy level in order to have the
most stable arrangement of electrons. Therefore, fluorine readily
accepts an electron from any element that is equally “eager” to give one
up, such as the metal lithium or sodium. As a result, fluorine is highly
reactive. In fact, reactions with fluorine are often explosive, as you
can see in the URL below. Neon, on the other hand, already has a full
outer energy level. It is already very stable and never reacts with
other elements. It neither accepts nor gives up electrons. Neon doesn’t
even react with fluorine, which reacts with all other elements except
helium.

### Why Most Nonmetals Cannot Conduct Electricity {#3.html#x-ck12-V2h5IE1vc3QgTm9ubWV0YWxzIENhbm5vdCBDb25kdWN0IEVsZWN0cmljaXR5_47-ab6}

Like most other nonmetals, fluorine cannot conduct electricity, and its
electrons explain this as well. An electric current is a flow of
electrons. Elements that readily give up electrons (the metals) can
carry electric current because their electrons can flow freely. Elements
that gain electrons instead of giving them up cannot carry electric
current. They hold onto their electrons so they cannot flow.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._47-p6t}

-   Nonmetals are elements that generally cannot conduct electricity.
    They are the second largest class of elements after metals. Examples
    of nonmetals include hydrogen, carbon, chlorine, and helium.
-   Properties of nonmetals include a relatively low boiling point, so
    many nonmetals are gases. Nonmetals are also poor conductors of
    heat, and solid nonmetals are dull and brittle.
-   Some nonmetals are very reactive, whereas others are not reactive
    at all. It depends on the number of electrons in their outer
    energy level.
-   Reactive nonmetals tend to gain electrons. This explains why they
    cannot conduct electricity, which is a flow of electrons.

What is this intricate orb? It is the greatly magnified skeleton of
single-celled ocean organisms call radiolarian. The skeleton is made of
an element that is extremely common on Earth. In fact, it is the second
most abundant element in Earth’s crust. It is also one of the most
common elements in the entire universe. What is this important element?
Its name is silicon, and it belongs to a class of elements called
metalloids.

### What Are Metalloids {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTWV0YWxsb2lkcw.._48-to1}

**Metalloids** are the smallest class of elements. (The other two
classes of elements are metals and nonmetals). There are just six
metalloids. In addition to silicon, they include boron, germanium,
arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Metalloids fall between metals and
nonmetals in the periodic table. They also fall between metals and
nonmetals in terms of their properties.

**Q:** How does the position of an element in the periodic table
influence its properties?

**A:** Elements are arranged in the periodic table by their atomic
number, which is the number of protons in their atoms. Atoms are neutral
in electric charge, so they always have the same number of electrons as
protons. It is the number of electrons in the outer energy level of
atoms that determines most of the properties of elements.

### Chemical Properties of Metalloids {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBNZXRhbGxvaWRz_48-bvv}

How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements
depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of
their atoms. Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer
energy level. Boron, pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm9yb24.) , is the only metalloid with
just three electrons in its outer energy level. It tends to act like
metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions. Metalloids with
more than four electrons in their outer energy level (arsenic, antimony,
and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in
chemical reactions. Those with exactly four electrons in their outer
energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or
nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction.

### Physical Properties of Metalloids {#3.html#x-ck12-UGh5c2ljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBNZXRhbGxvaWRz_48-yu8}

Most metalloids have some physical properties of metals and some
physical properties of nonmetals. For example, metals are good
conductors of both heat and electricity, whereas nonmetals generally
cannot conduct heat or electricity. And metalloids? They fall between
metals and nonmetals in their ability to conduct heat, and if they can
conduct electricity, they usually can do so only at higher temperatures.
Metalloids that can conduct electricity at higher temperatures are
called semiconductors. Silicon is an example of a semiconductor. It is
used to make the tiny electric circuits in computer chips. You can see a
sample of silicon and a silicon chip in the **Figure**

Metalloids tend to be shiny like metals but brittle like nonmetals.
Because they are brittle, they may chip like glass or crumble to a
powder if struck. Other physical properties of metalloids are more
variable, including their boiling and melting points, although all
metalloids exist as solids at room temperature. You can learn about the
properties of specific metalloids by watching the video at this URL:

Did you ever play the card game called go fish? Players try to form
groups of cards of the same value, such as four sevens, with the cards
they are dealt or by getting cards from other players or the deck. This
give and take of cards is a simple analogy for the way atoms give and
take valence electrons in chemical reactions.

### What Are Valence Electrons? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgVmFsZW5jZSBFbGVjdHJvbnM__49-k2x}

**Valence electrons** are the electrons in the outer energy level of an
atom that can participate in interactions with other atoms. Valence
electrons are generally the electrons that are farthest from the
nucleus. As a result, they may be attracted as much or more by the
nucleus of another atom than they are by their own nucleus.

### Electron Dot Diagrams {#3.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb24gRG90IERpYWdyYW1z_49-vbt}

Because valence electrons are so important, atoms are often represented
by simple diagrams that show only their valence electrons. These are
called electron dot diagrams, and three are shown below. In this type of
diagram, an element's chemical symbol is surrounded by dots that
represent the valence electrons. Typically, the dots are drawn as if
there is a square surrounding the element symbol with up to two dots per
side. An element never has more than eight valence electrons, so there
can’t be more than eight dots per atom.

### Valence Electrons and the Periodic Table {#3.html#x-ck12-VmFsZW5jZSBFbGVjdHJvbnMgYW5kIHRoZSBQZXJpb2RpYyBUYWJsZQ.._49-png}

The number of valence electrons in an atom is reflected by its position
in the periodic table of the elements (see the periodic table in the
**Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1WYWxlbmNlRWxlY3Ryb25z)
). Across each row, or period, of the periodic table, the number of
valence electrons in groups 1–2 and 13–18 increases by one from one
element to the next. Within each column, or group, of the table, all the
elements have the same number of valence electrons. This explains why
all the elements in the same group have very similar chemical
properties.

For elements in groups 1–2 and 13–18, the number of valence electrons is
easy to tell directly from the periodic table. This is illustrated in
the simplified periodic table in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzZfVmFsZW5jZV9FbGVjdHJvbnM.) . It
shows just the numbers of valence electrons in each of these groups. For
elements in groups 3–12, determining the number of valence electrons is
more complicated. You can learn more about the valence electrons of
elements in these groups at this URL:

**Q:** Based on both periodic tables above ( **Figures**

and [above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzZfVmFsZW5jZV9FbGVjdHJvbnM.) ),
what are examples of elements that have just one valence electron? What
are examples of elements that have eight valence electrons? How many
valence electrons does oxygen (O) have?

**A:** Any element in group 1 has just one valence electron. Examples
include hydrogen (H), lithium (Li), and sodium (Na). Any element in
group 18 has eight valence electrons (except for helium, which has a
total of just two electrons). Examples include neon (Ne), argon (Ar),
and krypton (Kr). Oxygen, like all the other elements in group 16, has
six valence electrons.

### Valence Electrons and Reactivity {#3.html#x-ck12-VmFsZW5jZSBFbGVjdHJvbnMgYW5kIFJlYWN0aXZpdHk._49-jln}

The table salt pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfU3BpbGxlZE5hQ2w.) contains two elements
that are so reactive they are rarely found alone in nature. Instead,
they undergo chemical reactions with other elements and form compounds.
Table salt is the compound named sodium chloride (NaCl). It forms when
an atom of sodium (Na) gives up an electron and an atom of chlorine (Cl)
accepts it. When this happens, sodium becomes a positively charged ion
(Na ^+^ ), and chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion (Cl ^-^ ). The
two ions are attracted to each and join a matrix of interlocking sodium
and chloride ions, forming a crystal of salt.

Table salt (sodium chloride).

</div>

**Q:** Why does sodium give up an electron?

**A:** An atom of a group 1 element such as sodium has just one valence
electron. It is “eager” to give up this electron in order to have a full
outer energy level, because this will give it the most stable
arrangement of electrons. You can see how this happens in the animation
at the following URL and in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMgUFMgMiAzIDYgTmFDbA..) . Group 2 elements with
two valence electrons are almost as reactive as elements in group 1 for
the same reason.

**Figure 3.103**

</div>

**Q:** Why does chlorine accept the electron from sodium?

**A:** An atom of a group 17 element such as chlorine has seven valence
electrons. It is “eager” to gain an extra electron to fill its outer
energy level and gain stability. Group 16 elements with six valence
electrons are almost as reactive for the same reason.

Atoms of group 18 elements have eight valence electrons (or two in the
case of helium). These elements already have a full outer energy level,
so they are very stable. As a result, they rarely if ever react with
other elements. Elements in other groups vary in their reactivity but
are generally less reactive than elements in groups 1, 2, 16, or 17.

**Q:** Find calcium (Ca) in the periodic table (see **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1WYWxlbmNlRWxlY3Ryb25z)
). Based on its position in the table, how reactive do you think calcium
is? Name another element with which calcium might react.

**A:** Calcium is a group 2 element with two valence electrons.
Therefore, it is very reactive and gives up electrons in chemical
reactions. It is likely to react with an element with six valence
electrons that “wants” to gain two electrons. This would be an element
in group 6, such as oxygen.

### Valence Electrons and Electricity {#3.html#x-ck12-VmFsZW5jZSBFbGVjdHJvbnMgYW5kIEVsZWN0cmljaXR5_49-vhw}

Valence electrons also determine how well—if at all—the atoms of an
element conduct electricity. The copper wires in the cable in the
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ3V0d2lyZQ..) are coated with
plastic. Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, so it is used
for wires that carry electric current. Plastic contains mainly carbon,
which cannot conduct electricity, so it is used as insulation on the
wires.

**Figure 3.104**

</div>

**Q:** Why do copper and carbon differ in their ability to conduct
electricity?

**A:** Atoms of metals such as copper easily give up valence electrons.
Their electrons can move freely and carry electric current. You can see
in detail how this occurs at the URL below. Atoms of nonmetals such as
the carbon, on the other hand, hold onto their electrons. Their
electrons can’t move freely and carry current.

[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/conins.html](conins.html)

A few elements, called metalloids, can conduct electricity, but not as
well as metals. Examples include silicon and germanium in group 14. Both
become better conductors at higher temperatures. These elements are
called semiconductors.

**Q:** How many valence electrons do atoms of silicon and germanium
have? What happens to their valence electrons when the atoms are exposed
to an electric field?

**A:** Atoms of these two elements have four valence electrons. When the
atoms are exposed to an electric field, the valence electrons move away
from the atoms and allow current to flow.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._49-4l2}

-   Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an
    atom that can participate in interactions with other atoms.
-   Because valence electrons are so important, atoms may be represented
    by electron dot diagrams that show only their valence electrons.
-   The number of valence electrons in atoms may cause them to be
    unreactive or highly reactive. For those atoms that are reactive,
    the number of valence electrons also determines whether they tend to
    give up or gain electrons in chemical reactions.
-   Metals, which easily give up electrons, can conduct electricity.
    Nonmetals, which attract electrons, generally cannot. Metalloids
    such as silicon and germanium can conduct electricity but not as
    well as metals.

You probably think of water as a substance that can put out fires. But
some elements are so reactive that they burn in water. In fact, they
virtually explode in water. That’s what is happening in the photo above.
About 3 pounds of sodium were added to water, and the result was this
explosive reaction. Why is sodium such a reactive element? In this
lesson you will find out.

### The First Group {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZpcnN0IEdyb3Vw_50-mtr}

Sodium (Na) is an element in group 1 of the periodic table of the
elements. This group (column) of the table is shown below. It includes
the nonmetal hydrogen (H) and six metals that are called **alkali
metals** . Elements in the same group of the periodic table have the
same number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in their outer
energy level that can be involved in chemical reactions. Valence
electrons determine many of the properties of an element, so elements in
the same group have similar properties. All the elements in group 1 have
just one valence electron. This makes them very reactive.

**Q:** Why does having just one valence electron make group 1 elements
very reactive?

**A:** With just one valence electron, group 1 elements are “eager” to
lose that electron. Doing so allows them to achieve a full outer energy
level and maximum stability.

### Reactivity of Group 1 Elements {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVhY3Rpdml0eSBvZiBHcm91cCAxIEVsZW1lbnRz_50-fpm}

Hydrogen is a very reactive gas, and the alkali metals are even more
reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive metals and, along with the
elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The
reactivity of alkali metals increases from the top to the bottom of the
group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium
(Fr) is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they
are found in nature only in combination with other elements. They often
combine with group 17 elements, which are very “eager” to gain an
electron. At the URL below, you can watch a video that shows just how
reactive the alkali metals are.

### Other Properties of Alkali Metals {#3.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBBbGthbGkgTWV0YWxz_50-lzz}

Besides being very reactive, alkali metals share a number of other
properties.

-   Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature.
-   Alkali metals are low in density, and some of them float on water.
-   Alkali metals are relatively soft. Some are even soft enough to cut
    with a knife, like the sodium pictured in the **Figure**

### A Closer Look {#3.html#x-ck12-QSBDbG9zZXIgTG9vaw.._50-mra}

Although all group 1 elements share certain properties, such as being
very reactive, they are not alike in every way. Three different group 1
elements are described in more detail below ( **Figures**

in which they differ from one another.

gas](ck12_3_files/20150911012346997145.png "Molecule of hydrogen gas")

**Figure 3.106**

Hydrogen has the smallest, lightest atoms of all elements. Pure hydrogen
is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas that is nontoxic but highly
flammable. Hydrogen gas exists mainly as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules
(H ~2~ ), as shown in the diagram on the right. Hydrogen is the most
abundant element in the universe and the third most abundant element on
Earth, occurring mainly in compounds such as water.

</div>

**Q:** Why do you think hydrogen gas usually exists as diatomic
molecules?

**A:** Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. When two hydrogen atoms
bond together, they share a pair of electrons. The shared electrons fill
their only energy level, giving them the most stable arrangement of
electrons.

**Figure 3.108**

Francium has one of the largest, heaviest atoms of all elements. Its one
valence electron is far removed from the nucleus, as you can see in the
atomic model on the right, so it is easily removed from the atom.
Francium is radioactive and quickly decays to form other elements such
as radium. This is why francium is extremely rare in nature. Less than
an ounce of francium is present on Earth at any given time.

</div>

**Q:** Francium decays too quickly to form compounds with other
elements. Which elements to you think it would bond with if it could?

**A:** With one valence electron, francium would bond with a halogen
element in group 17, which has seven valence electrons and needs one
more to fill its outer energy level. Elements in group 17 include
fluorine and chlorine.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._50-nce}

-   Group 1 of the periodic table includes hydrogen and the
    alkali metals.
-   Because they have just one valence electron, group 1 elements are
    very reactive. As a result, they are found in nature only in
    combination with other elements.
-   Alkali metals are all solids at room temperature. They are
    relatively soft and low in density.
-   From the top to the bottom of group 1, the elements have heavier,
    more reactive atoms.

Sparklers like the one this girl is holding make festive additions to
many celebrations. You may use them yourself. But watch out if you do
because their flames are really hot! The bright white flames are
produced when magnesium burns. Magnesium is a light- weight metal that
burns at a very high temperature. Other uses of magnesium include flash

Barium (Ba) is one of six elements in group 2 of the periodic table,
which is shown below. Elements in this group are called **alkaline Earth
metals** . These metals are silver or gray in color. They are relatively
soft and low in density, although not as soft and lightweight as alkali
metals. You can watch a brief video introduction to the alkaline Earth
metals at this URL:

### Reactivity of Alkaline Earth Metals {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVhY3Rpdml0eSBvZiBBbGthbGluZSBFYXJ0aCBNZXRhbHM._51-rjx}

All alkaline Earth metals have similar properties because they all have
two valence electrons. They readily give up their two valence electrons
to achieve a full outer energy level, which is the most stable
arrangement of electrons. As a result, they are very reactive, although
not quite as reactive as the alkali metals in group 1. For example,
alkaline Earth metals will react with cold water, but not explosively as
alkali metals do. Because of their reactivity, alkaline Earth metals
never exist as pure substances in nature. Instead, they are always found
combined with other elements.

The reactivity of alkaline Earth metals increases from the top to the
bottom of the group. That’s because the atoms get bigger from the top to
the bottom, so the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. When
valence electrons are farther from the nucleus, they are attracted less
strongly by the nucleus and more easily removed from the atom. This
makes the atom more reactive.

**Q:** Alkali metals have just one valence electron. Why are alkaline
Earth metals less reactive than alkali metals?

**A:** It takes more energy to remove two valence electrons from an atom
than one valence electron. This makes alkaline Earth metals with their
two valence electrons less reactive than alkali metals with their one
valence electron.

### Examples of Alkaline Earth Metals {#3.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgQWxrYWxpbmUgRWFydGggTWV0YWxz_51-xbm}

For a better understanding of alkaline Earth metals, let’s take a closer
look at two of them: calcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr). Calcium is a soft,
gray, nontoxic alkaline Earth metal. Although pure calcium doesn’t exist
in nature, calcium compounds are very common in Earth’s crust and in sea
water. Calcium is also the most abundant metal in the human body,
occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium
carbonate. These calcium compounds are found in bones and make them hard
and strong. The skeleton of the average adult contains about a kilogram
of calcium. Because calcium—like barium—absorbs x-rays, bones show up
white in x-ray images. Calcium is an important component of a healthy
human diet. Good food sources of calcium are pictured in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMgUFMgMiAzIDggQ2FsY2l1bQ..) .

calcium](ck12_3_files/20150911012348018765.jpeg "Foods that are good sources of calcium")

**Figure 3.109**

</div>

**Q:** What health problems might result from a diet low in calcium?

**A:** Children who don’t get enough calcium while their bones are
forming may develop a deficiency disease called rickets, in which their
bones are softer than normal and become bent and stunted. Adults who
don’t get enough calcium may develop a condition called osteoporosis, in
which the bones lose calcium and become weak and brittle. People with
osteoporosis are at high risk of bone fractures.

Strontium is a silver-colored alkaline Earth metal that is even softer
than calcium. Strontium compounds are quite common and have a variety of
uses—from fireworks to cement to toothpaste. In fireworks, strontium
compounds produce deep red explosions. In toothpaste, like the one
pictured in the **Figure**

strontium chloride reduces tooth sensitivity.

What do all of the objects pictured above have in common? All of them
are made completely or primarily of copper. Copper has an amazing
variety of uses, including cooking pots, plumbing pipes, roofing tiles,
jewelry, musical instruments, and electric wires. Copper is a good
choice for these and many other objects because of its properties. It
can be formed into wires and flat sheets, it’s a great conductor of heat
and electricity, it’s hard and strong, and it doesn’t corrode easily. In
all these ways, copper is a typical transition metal.

### What Are Transition Metals? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgVHJhbnNpdGlvbiBNZXRhbHM__52-6br}

**Transition metals** are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the
periodic table. In the periodic table pictured in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMi0zLTEyLVBlcmlvZGljLVRhYmxl) , they are
the elements shaded yellow, pink, and purple. The transition metals make
up about 60 percent of all known elements. In addition to copper (Cu),
well known examples of transition metals include iron (Fe), zinc (Zn),
silver (Ag), and gold (Au) (Copper (Cu) is pictured in its various
applications in the opening image). You can explore specific transition
metals with the interactive periodic table at this URL:

**Q:** Transition metals have been called the most typical of all
metals. What do you think this means?

**A:** Unlike some other metals, transition metals have the properties
that define the metals class. They are excellent conductors of
electricity, for example, and they also have luster, malleability, and
ductility. You can read more about these properties of transition metals
below.

### Properties of Transition Metals {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBUcmFuc2l0aW9uIE1ldGFscw.._52-woj}

Transition metals are superior conductors of heat as well as
electricity. They are malleable, which means they can be shaped into
sheets, and ductile, which means they can be shaped into wires. They
have high melting and boiling points, and all are solids at room
temperature, except for mercury (Hg), which is a liquid. Transition
metals are also high in density and very hard. Most of them are white or
silvery in color, and they are generally lustrous, or shiny. The
compounds that transition metals form with other elements are often very
colorful. You can see several examples in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzlfVHJhbnNpdGlvbl9Db21wb3VuZHMtQUxU)

</div>

Some properties of transition metals set them apart from other metals.
Compared with the alkali metals in group 1 and the alkaline Earth metals
in group 2, the transition metals are much less reactive. They don’t
react quickly with water or oxygen, which explains why they resist
corrosion.

Other properties of the transition metals are unique. They are the only
elements that may use electrons in the next to highest—as well as the
highest—energy level as valence electrons. Valence electrons are the
electrons that form bonds with other elements in compounds and that
generally determine the properties of elements. Transition metals are
unusual in having very similar properties even with different numbers of
valence electrons. The transition metals also include the only elements
that produce a magnetic field. Three of them have this property: iron
(Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni).

**Q:** How is the number of valence electrons typically related to the
properties of elements?

**A:** The number of valence electrons usually determines how reactive
elements are as well as the ways in which they react with other
elements.

### Those Elements Down Under {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhvc2UgRWxlbWVudHMgRG93biBVbmRlcg.._52-otl}

Transition metals include the elements that are most often placed below
the periodic table (the pink- and purple-shaded elements in the
**Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMi0zLTEyLVBlcmlvZGljLVRhYmxl)
). Those that follow lanthanum (La) are called lanthanides. They are all
relatively reactive for transition metals. Those that follow actinium
(Ac) are called actinides. They are all radioactive. This means that
they are unstable, so they decay into different, more stable elements.
Many of the actinides do not occur in nature but are made in
laboratories.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._52-wz5}

-   Transition metals are all the elements in groups 3–12 of the
    periodic table. More than half of all elements are
    transition metals.
-   Transition metals are typical metals, with properties such as a
    superior ability to conduct electricity and heat. They also have the
    metallic properties of luster, malleability, and ductility. In
    addition, transition metals have high melting and boiling points and
    high density.
-   The lanthanides and actinides are the transition metals that are
    usually placed below the main part of the periodic table.
    Lanthanides are relatively reactive for transition metals, and
    actinides are radioactive.

This image represents a famous ancient Egyptian named Tutankhamen. Do
you see his heavy eyeliner? Most likely the eyeliner was made of a
mineral containing antimony. This metalloid was commonly used for makeup
by Egyptians between four and five thousand years ago. Today we know
that antimony is toxic, although Tutankhamen probably didn’t know that.
Antimony is found in group 15 of the periodic table. Group 15 is one of
four groups of the periodic table that contain metalloids.  

### Groups 13–16 {#3.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXBzIDEz4oCTMTY._53-tfm}

Groups 13–16 of the periodic table (orange in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzJfUGVyaW9kaWNfVGFibGUtR3JvdXBzMTMxNg..)
) are the only groups that contain elements classified as metalloids.
Unlike other groups of the periodic table, which contain elements in
just one class, groups 13–16 contain elements in at least two different
classes. In addition to metalloids, they also contain metals, nonmetals,
or both. Groups 13–16 fall between the transition metals (in groups
3–12) and the nonmetals called halogens (in group 17).

### What Are Metalloids? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTWV0YWxsb2lkcz8._53-uj6}

**Metalloids** are the smallest class of elements, containing just six
members: boron (B), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), arsenic (As), antimony
(Sb), and tellurium (Te). Metalloids have some properties of metals
(elements that can conduct electricity) and some properties of nonmetals
(elements that cannot conduct electricity). For example, most metalloids
can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. Metalloids also tend
to be shiny like metals, but brittle like nonmetals. Chemically,
metalloids may behave like metals or nonmetals, depending on their
number of valence electrons. You can learn more about specific
metalloids by clicking on the element symbols in the periodic table at
this URL: [http://www.chemicool.com/]() .

**Q:** Why does the chemical behavior of an element depend on its number
of valence electrons?

**A:** Valence electrons are the electrons in an atom’s outer energy
level that may be involved in chemical reactions with other atoms.

### Group 13: Boron Group {#3.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXAgMTM6IEJvcm9uIEdyb3Vw_53-v69}

Group 13 of the periodic table is also called the boron group because
boron (B) is the first element at the top of the group (see **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzEwX0JvcmF4) ). Boron is also the
only metalloid in this group. The other four elements in the
group—aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (Tl)—are
all metals. Group 13 elements have three valence electrons and are
fairly reactive. All of them are solids at room temperature.

### Group 14: Carbon Group {#3.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXAgMTQ6IENhcmJvbiBHcm91cA.._53-qdk}

Group 14 of the periodic table is headed by the nonmetal carbon (C), so
this group is also called the carbon group. Carbon is followed by
silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzEwX0ZpYmVyX09wdGljcw..) ), which
are metalloids, and then by tin (Sn) and lead (Pb), which are metals.
Group 14 elements group have four valence electrons, so they generally
aren't very reactive. All of them are solids at room temperature.

### Group 15: Nitrogen Group {#3.html#x-ck12-R3JvdXAgMTU6IE5pdHJvZ2VuIEdyb3Vw_53-1ep}

Group 15 of the periodic table is also called the nitrogen group. The
first element in the group is the nonmetal nitrogen (N), followed by
phosphorus (P), another nonmetal. Arsenic (As) ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfMl8zXzEwX0Fyc2VuaWNfUG9pc29u) ) and
antimony (Sb) are the metalloids in this group, and bismuth (Bi) is a
metal. All group 15 elements have five valence electrons, but they vary
in their reactivity. Nitrogen, for example, is not very reactive at all,
whereas phosphorus is very reactive and found naturally only in
combination with other substances. All group 15 elements are solids,
except for nitrogen, which is a gas.

first three elements—oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and selenium (Se)—are
nonmetals. They are followed by tellurium (Te) ( **Figure**

Tellurium is a silvery white, brittle metalloid. It is toxic and may
cause birth defects. Tellurium can conduct electricity when exposed to
light, so it is used to make solar panels. It has several other uses as

lends color to ceramics.

**Q:** With six valence electrons, group 16 elements need to attract two
electrons from another element to have a stable electron arrangement of
eight valence electrons. Which group of elements in the periodic table
do you think might form compounds with elements in group 16?

**A:** Group 2 elements, called the alkaline Earth metals, form
compounds with elements in the oxygen group. That’s because group 2
elements have two valence electrons that they are “eager” to give up. An
example of a group 2 and group 6 compound is calcium oxide (CaO).

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._53-jjr}

You’ve probably seen halogen lights like the ones pictured here. You may
even have halogen lights in your home. If you do, you may have noticed
that they get really hot and give off a lot of light for their size. A
halogen light differs from a regular incandescent light bulb in having a
small amount of halogen gas inside the bulb. The gas combines chemically
with the metal in the filament, and this extends the life of the
filament. It allows the lamp to get hotter and give off more light than
a regular incandescent light without burning out quickly. What is
halogen gas, and which elements are halogens? In this article, you’ll
find out.  

### Meet the Halogens {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVldCB0aGUgSGFsb2dlbnM._54-0so}

**Halogens** are highly reactive nonmetallic elements in group 17 of the
periodic table. As you can see in the periodic table shown in the
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQW5vdGhlclBlcmlvZGljVGFibGU.)
, the halogens include the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine
(Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). All of them are relatively common
on Earth except for astatine. Astatine is radioactive and rapidly decays
to other, more stable elements. As a result, it is one of the least
common elements on Earth.

**Q:** Based on their position in the periodic table from the **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQW5vdGhlclBlcmlvZGljVGFibGU.) , how many
valence electrons do you think halogens have?

**A:** The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in
group 1. It then increases by one from left to right across each period
(row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore,
halogens have seven valence electrons.

### Chemical Properties of Halogens {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBIYWxvZ2Vucw.._54-nbs}

The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although
reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group.
Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to
gain one more electron. Doing so gives them a full outer energy level,
which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often
combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali
metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally “eager” to
donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top
of the group, may be explosive. You can see some examples in the video
at the URL below. ( *Warning:* Don’t try any of these reactions at
home!)

### Physical Properties of Halogens {#3.html#x-ck12-UGh5c2ljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBIYWxvZ2Vucw.._54-swt}

The halogen group is quite diverse. It includes elements that occur in
three different states of matter at room temperature. Fluorine and
chlorine are gases, bromine is a liquid, and iodine and astatine are
solids. Halogens also vary in color, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGFsb2dlbnM.) . Fluorine and chlorine are
green, bromine is red, and iodine and astatine are nearly black. Like
other nonmetals, halogens cannot conduct electricity or heat. Compared
with most other elements, halogens have relatively low melting and
boiling points. You can watch a lab demonstration of the melting and
boiling points of halogens at this URL:

### Uses of Halogens {#3.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBIYWxvZ2Vucw.._54-wi4}

Most halogens have a variety of important uses. A few are described in
the **Table** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-SGFsb2dlbkNvbXBvdW5kcw..) .

**Q:** Can you relate some of these uses of halogens to the properties
of these elements?

**A:** The ability of halogens to kill germs and bleach clothes relates
to their highly reactive nature.

Okay, helium balloons are light, but they’re not that light! This
fanciful picture serves to make the point that helium is one of the
lightest elements. Helium belongs to a group of elements called the
noble gases.

### What Are Noble Gases? {#3.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTm9ibGUgR2FzZXM__55-r3n}

**Noble gases** are nonreactive, nonmetallic elements in group 18 of the
periodic table. As you can see in the periodic table in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Ob2JsZUdhc2Vz) , noble
gases include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon
(Xe), and radon (Rn). All noble gases are colorless and odorless. They
also have low boiling points, explaining why they are gases at room
temperature. Radon, at the bottom of the group, is radioactive, so it
constantly decays to other elements. For an excellent overview of the
noble gases, watch the video at this URL:

**Figure 3.120**

</div>

**Q:** Based on their position in the periodic table ( **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGVyaW9kaWNUYWJsZS1Ob2JsZUdhc2Vz) ), how
many valence electrons do you think noble gases have?

**A:** The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in
group 1. It then increases by one from left to right across each period
(row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, noble
gases have eight valence electrons.

### Chemical Properties of Noble Gases {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBOb2JsZSBHYXNlcw.._55-xyw}

Noble gases are the least reactive of all known elements. That’s because
with eight valence electrons, their outer energy levels are full. The
only exception is helium, which has just two electrons. But helium also
has a full outer energy level, because its only energy level (energy
level 1) can hold a maximum of two electrons. A full outer energy level
is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, noble gases
cannot become more stable by reacting with other elements and gaining or
losing valence electrons. Therefore, noble gases are rarely involved in
chemical reactions and almost never form compounds with other elements.

### Noble Gases and the Octet Rule {#3.html#x-ck12-Tm9ibGUgR2FzZXMgYW5kIHRoZSBPY3RldCBSdWxl_55-f9j}

Because the noble gases are the least reactive of all elements, their
eight valence electrons are used as the standard for nonreactivity and
to explain how other elements interact. This is stated as the octet
(“group of eight”) rule. According to this rule, atoms react to form
compounds that allow them to have a group of eight valence electrons
like the noble gases. For example, sodium (with one valence electron)
reacts with chlorine (with seven valence electrons) to form the stable
compound sodium chloride (table salt). In this reaction, sodium donates
an electron and chlorine accepts it, giving each element an octet of
valence electrons.

### Some Uses of Noble Gases {#3.html#x-ck12-U29tZSBVc2VzIG9mIE5vYmxlIEdhc2Vz_55-0a6}

Did you ever get helium balloons like those in the opening picture?
Unlike a balloon filled with air, a balloon filled with helium needs to
be weighted down so it won’t float away — although you don’t have to use
an elephant!.

**Q:** Why does a helium balloon float away if it’s not weighted down?

**A:** Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two
electrons, so they have less mass than any other atoms except hydrogen.
As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon
floats up into the air unless weighted down.

Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfb2xkbGlnaHRidWxi) , didn’t last very
long. The filaments quickly burned out. Although air was pumped out of
the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum. Oxygen in the small amount of air
remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal filament. This
corroded the filament and caused dark deposits on the glass. Filling a
light bulb with argon gas prevents these problems. That’s why modern
light bulbs are filled with argon.

**Q:** How does argon prevent the problems of early light bulbs?

**A:** As a noble gas with eight electrons, argon doesn’t react with the
metal in the filament. This protects the filament and keeps the glass
blub free of deposits.

Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like
the one in the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTmVvblNpZ24.) .
Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be
energized by sending an electric current through them. When this
happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons
return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light.
Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off
reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton
gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.

Yummy! S’mores are on the way! Did you ever toast marshmallows over a
campfire? The sweet treats singe on the outside and melt on the inside.
Both the fire and the toasted marshmallows are evidence of chemical
changes. In the process of burning, the wood changes to ashes and gases,
and the outside of the marshmallow turns brown and crispy. Neither the
wood nor the marshmallows can change back to their original form. That’s
because burning is a chemical change and chemical changes are often
impossible to undo. In this unit, you’ll learn about many types of
chemical changes, including how they occur and why you can’t live
without them.

Did you ever make cupcakes from scratch? You mix together flour, sugar,
eggs, and other ingredients to make the batter, put the batter into
cupcake papers, and then put them into the oven to bake. The cupcakes
that come out of the oven after baking are different from any of the
individual ingredients that went into the batter. Like the ingredients
that join together to make cupcakes, atoms of different elements can
join together to form entirely different substances called compounds. In
cupcakes, the eggs and other wet ingredients cause the dry ingredients
to stick together. What causes elements to stick together in compounds?
The answer is chemical bonds.

### What Is a Chemical Bond? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENoZW1pY2FsIEJvbmQ_-wlo}

A **chemical bond** is a force of attraction between atoms or ions.
Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence
electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that
may be involved in chemical interactions. Valence electrons are the
basis of all chemical bonds. For a video introduction to chemical bonds,
go to this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGA8sRwqIFg](watch?v=CGA8sRwqIFg) .

**Q:** Why do you think that chemical bonds form?

**A:** Chemical bonds form because they give atoms a more stable
arrangement of electrons.

### Why Bonds Form {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEJvbmRzIEZvcm0.-lzu}

To understand why chemical bonds form, consider the common compound
known as water, or H ~2~ O. It consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and
one oxygen (O) atom. As you can see in the on the left side of the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpMDcwMQ..) , each hydrogen atom
has just one electron, which is also its sole valence electron. The
oxygen atom has six valence electrons. These are the electrons in the
outer energy level of the oxygen atom.

![Bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in
water](ck12_4_files/20150911012510676031.png "Bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water")

**Figure 4.1**

</div>

In the water molecule on the right in the **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpMDcwMQ..) , each hydrogen atom shares a
pair of electrons with the oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom
has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. The
hydrogen atoms each have a pair of shared electrons, so their first and
only energy level is full. The oxygen atom has a total of eight valence
electrons, so its outer energy level is full. A full outer energy level
is the most stable possible arrangement of electrons. It explains why
elements form chemical bonds with each other.

### Types of Chemical Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQ2hlbWljYWwgQm9uZHM.-pzj}

Not all chemical bonds form in the same way as the bonds in water. There
are actually three different types of chemical bonds, called covalent,
ionic, and metallic bonds. Each type of bond is described below. You can
learn more about the three types by watching this video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEFeLYWTKX0](watch?v=hEFeLYWTKX0)

[![](ck12_4_files/tmpqBsKG1.jpeg)](hEFeLYWTKX0%3Fwmode%3Dtransparent%26hash%3D76f0f686aac6011295ce54ae1dc37ffb)

For an entertaining song comparing covalent and ionic bonds, go to this
URL: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCYrNU-7SfA](watch?v=BCYrNU-7SfA)

-   A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two
    nonmetal atoms that share a pair of electrons. One electron is
    provided by each atom, and the pair of electrons is attracted to the
    positive nuclei of both atoms. The water molecule represented in the
    **Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpMDcwMQ..) contains
    covalent bonds.
-   An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together
    oppositely charged ions. Ionic bonds form crystals instead
    of molecules. Table salt contains ionic bonds.
-   A metallic bond is the force of attraction between a positive metal
    ion and the valence electrons that surround it—both its own valence
    electrons and those of other ions of the same metal. The ions and
    electrons form a lattice-like structure. Only metals, such as the
    copper pictured in the **Figure**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM18xXzFfY29wcGVy) , form
    metallic bonds.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-dtu}

-   A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions.
    Bonds form when atoms share or transfer valence electrons.
-   Atoms form chemical bonds to achieve a full outer energy level,
    which is the most stable arrangement of electrons.
-   There are three different types of chemical bonds: covalent, ionic,
    and metallic bonds.

Look at all the colors you can make by mixing together just a few colors
of paint. In the photo above, the rainbow of colors on the brush formed
from just four paint colors: green, yellow, red, and blue. The same
thing is true of matter in general. By combining just a few different
elements, you can form many different chemical compounds.

### What Are Compounds? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQ29tcG91bmRzPw.._1-5ih}

A **compound** is a unique substance that forms when two or more
elements combine chemically. Compounds form as a result of chemical
reactions. The elements in compounds are held together by chemical
bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions
that share or transfer valence electrons. For a video introduction to
compounds, go to this URL:

Water is an example of a common chemical compound. As you can see in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM18xXzJfbW9sZWN1bGVz) , each
water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Water always has this 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen. Like water, all
compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. It doesn’t matter how
much or how little of a compound there is. It always has the same
composition.

**Q:** Sometimes the same elements combine in different ratios. How can
this happen if a compound always consists of the same elements in the
same ratio?

**A:** If the same elements combine in different ratios, they form
different compounds.

### Same Elements, Different Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-U2FtZSBFbGVtZW50cywgRGlmZmVyZW50IENvbXBvdW5kcw.._1-sqy}

Look at the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMzEyX0xpcXVpZHM.)
of water (H ~2~ O) and hydrogen peroxide (H ~2~ O ~2~ ), and read about
these two compounds. Both compounds consist of hydrogen and oxygen, but
they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and
hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If
you’ve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know
that it is very different from water!

**Q:** Read the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMzEyX0dhc2Vz)
about carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and carbon monoxide (CO). Both compounds
consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How can you tell
that carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are different compounds?

**A:** You can tell that they are different compounds from their very
different properties. Carbon dioxide is a harmless gas that living
things add to the atmosphere during respiration. Carbon monoxide is a
deadly gas that can quickly kill people if it becomes too concentrated
in the air.

Carbon Monoxide: Carbon monoxide is produced when matter burns. It's a
colorless, odorless gas that is very harmful to human health. In fact,
it can kill people in minutes. Because you can't see or smell carbon

### Types of Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQ29tcG91bmRz_1-etd}

There are two basic types of compounds that differ in the nature of the
bonds that hold their atoms or ions together. They are covalent and
ionic compounds. Both types are described below. You can learn more
about the properties of covalent and ionic compounds at this URL:

-   Covalent compounds consist of atoms that are held together by
    covalent bonds. These bonds form between nonmetals that share
    valence electrons. Covalent compounds exist as individual molecules.
    Water is an example of a covalent compound.
-   Ionic compounds consist of ions that are held together by
    ionic bonds. These bonds form when metals transfer electrons
    to nonmetals. Ionic compounds exist as a matrix of many ions, called
    a crystal. Sodium chloride (table salt) is an example of an
    ionic compound.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-okv}

-   A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more
    elements combine chemically.
-   A compound always consists of the same elements in the same ratio.
    If the same elements combine in different ratios, they form
    different compounds.
-   Types of compounds include covalent and ionic compounds. They differ
    in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms or ions together.

You can make a simple salad dressing using just the two ingredients
pictured above: oil and vinegar. Recipes for oil-and-vinegar salad
dressing vary, but they typically include about three parts oil to one
part vinegar, or a ratio of 3:1. For example, if you wanted to make a
cup of salad dressing, you could mix together ![
\\frac{3}{4}](ck12_math_images_dir/d27681ab283a24bdb0ba40a5d1065469.png)
cup of oil and ![
\\frac{1}{4}](ck12_math_images_dir/bced7b40cbfdc037edde2a31408946de.png)
cup of vinegar. Chemical compounds also have “ingredients” in a certain
ratio. However, unlike oil-and-vinegar salad dressing, a chemical
compound always has exactly the same ratio of elements. This ratio can
be represented by a chemical formula.

### Representing Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-UmVwcmVzZW50aW5nIENvbXBvdW5kcw.._2-dcx}

In a **chemical formula** , the elements in a compound are represented
by their chemical symbols, and the ratio of different elements is
represented by subscripts. Consider the compound water as an example.
Each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Therefore, the chemical formula for water is:

<dl id="x-ck12-Yjg5ZTkxY2NmMTRiZmQ3ZjQ4NWRkN2JlN2Q3ODliMGE.-q3e">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-Yjg5ZTkxY2NmMTRiZmQ3ZjQ4NWRkN2JlN2Q3ODliMGE.-ebu">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-Yjg5ZTkxY2NmMTRiZmQ3ZjQ4NWRkN2JlN2Q3ODliMGE.-rwt">
<dd>
H ~2~ O

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen
in the molecule. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just
one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used in the
chemical formula.

### Formulas for Ionic and Covalent Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybXVsYXMgZm9yIElvbmljIGFuZCBDb3ZhbGVudCBDb21wb3VuZHM._2-8z2}

The **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG91bmRzQ2hlbWljYWxGb3JtdWxhcw..) shows four
examples of compounds and their chemical formulas. The first two
compounds are ionic compounds, and the second two are covalent
compounds. Each formula shows the ratio of ions or atoms that make up
the compound.

  Name of Compound    Type of Compound   Ratio of Ions or Atoms of Each Element            Chemical Formulas
  ------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------- -------------------
  Sodium chloride     ionic              1 sodium ion (Na ^+^ ) 1 chloride ion (Cl ^-^ )   NaCl
  Calcium iodide      ionic              1 calcium ion (Ca ^2+^ ) 2 iodide ions (I ^-^ )   CaI ~2~
  Hydrogen peroxide   covalent           2 hydrogen atoms (H) 2 oxygen atoms (O)           H ~2~ O ~2~
  Carbon dioxide      covalent           1 carbon atom (C) 2 oxygen atoms (O)              CO ~2~

There is a different rule for writing the chemical formula for each type
of compound.

Ionic compounds are compounds in which positive metal ions and negative
nonmetal ions are joined by ionic bonds. In these compounds, the
chemical symbol for the positive metal ion is written first, followed by
the symbol for the negative nonmetal ion. The video at the following URL
gives a fuller explanation of ionic compounds and their formulas:

left in the periodic table is written first, followed by the element
that is farther to the right. If both elements are in the same group of
the periodic table, the one with the higher period number is written
first. The following URL gives a fuller explanation of covalent

Look at the photos of bar magnets in the opening image. At first glance,
the two photos look very similar, but they differ in one important way.
In the top photo, the north (blue) poles of both magnets are placed
close together. In the bottom photo, the north pole of one magnet is
placed close to the south (red) pole of the other magnet. Now look
closely at the iron filings in the two photos. The ion filings show the
force of repulsion between the two north poles in the top photo and the
force of attraction between the north and south poles in the bottom
photo. Like the poles of magnets, electric charges repel or attract each
other. Two positive or two negative charges repel each other, and two
opposite charges attract each other. The attraction of opposite electric
charges explains how ionic bonds form.

### How Ionic Bonds Form {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IElvbmljIEJvbmRzIEZvcm0._3-lug}

An **ionic bond** is the force of attraction that holds together
positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of a metallic element
give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element. The **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDM.) shows how this happens.

**Figure 4.6**

</div>

In row 1 of the **Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDM.) , an
atom of sodium (Na) donates an electron to an atom of chlorine (Cl).

-   By losing an electron, the sodium atom becomes a sodium ion. It now
    has more protons than electrons and a charge of +1. Positive ions
    such as sodium are given the same name as the element. The chemical
    symbol has a plus sign to distinguish the ion from an atom of
    the element. The symbol for a sodium ion is Na ^+^ .
-   By gaining an electron, the chlorine atom becomes a chloride ion. It
    now has more electrons than protons and a charge of -1. Negative
    ions are named by adding the suffix – *ide* to the first part of the
    element name. The symbol for chloride is Cl ^-^ .

Sodium and chloride ions have equal but opposite charges. Opposite
electric charges attract each other, so sodium and chloride ions cling
together in a strong ionic bond. You can see this in row 2 of the
**Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDM.) . (Brackets separate
the ions in the diagram to show that the ions in the compound do not
actually share electrons.) When ionic bonds hold ions together, they
form an ionic compound. The compound formed from sodium and chloride
ions is named sodium chloride. It is commonly called table salt. You can
see an animation of sodium chloride forming at this URL:

### Why Ionic Bonds Form {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IElvbmljIEJvbmRzIEZvcm0._3-bdr}

Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That’s because
metals “want” to give up electrons, and nonmetals “want” to gain
electrons. Find sodium (Na) in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDA5) . Sodium is an alkali metal in
group 1. Like all group 1 elements, it has just one valence electron. If
sodium loses that one electron, it will have a full outer energy level,
which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Now find fluorine (F)
in the periodic table **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDA5) . Fluorine is a halogen in
group 17. Like all group 17 elements, fluorine has seven valence
electrons. If fluorine gains one electron, it will also have a full
outer energy level and the most stable arrangement of electrons.

**Figure 4.7**

</div>

**Q:** Predict what other elements might form ionic bonds.

**A:** Metals on the left and in the center of the periodic table form
ionic bonds with nonmetals on the right of the periodic table. For
example, alkali metals in group 1 form ionic bonds with halogen
nonmetals in group 17.

### Energy and Ionic Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IGFuZCBJb25pYyBCb25kcw.._3-xdg}

It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom because the
force of attraction between the negative electrons and the positive
nucleus must be overcome. The amount of energy needed depends on the
element. Less energy is needed to remove just one or a few valence
electrons than many. This explains why sodium and other alkali metals
form positive ions so easily. Less energy is also needed to remove
electrons from larger atoms in the same group. For example, in group 1,
it takes less energy to remove an electron from francium (Fr) at the
bottom of the group than from lithium (Li) at the top of the group (see
the **Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDA5) ). In bigger
atoms, valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. As a result, the
force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is
weaker.

**Q:** What do you think happens when an atom gains an electron and
becomes a negative ion?

**A:** Energy is released when an atom gains an electron. Halogens
release the most energy when they form ions. As a result, they are very
reactive elements.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-bn3}

-   An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together
    positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of a metallic
    element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element.
-   Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. That’s because
    metals “want” to give up electrons, and nonmetals “want” to
    gain electrons.

The truck pictured above is spreading crystals of the salt calcium
chloride on a snowy road to prevent ice from forming. The crystals lower
the freezing point of water so when the snow melts, it won’t turn to
ice. Do you know why calcium chloride lowers the freezing point of
water? The answer has to do with the type of compound that calcium
chloride is. Calcium chloride is an ionic compound.

### What Are Ionic Compounds? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgSW9uaWMgQ29tcG91bmRzPw.._4-xoj}

All compounds form when atoms of different elements share or transfer
electrons. Compounds in which electrons are transferred from one atom to
another are called ionic **compounds** . In this type of compound,
electrons actually move between the atoms, rather than being shared
between them. When atoms give up or accept electrons in this way, they
become charged particles called ions. The ions are held together by
ionic bonds, which form an ionic compound. Ionic compounds generally
form between elements that are metals and elements that are nonmetals.
For example, the metal calcium (Ca) and the nonmetal chlorine (Cl) form
the ionic compound calcium chloride (CaCl ~2~ ). In this compound, there
are two negative chloride ions for each positive calcium ion. Because
the positive and negative charges cancel out, an ionic compound is
neutral in charge.

**Q:** Now can you explain why calcium chloride prevents ice from
forming on a snowy road?

**A:** If calcium chloride dissolves in water, it breaks down into its
ions (Ca ^2+^ and Cl ^-^ ). When water has ions dissolved in it, it has
a lower freezing point. Pure water freezes at 0°C. With calcium and
chloride ions dissolved in it, it won’t freeze unless the temperature
reaches -29°C or lower.

### Crystals {#4.html#x-ck12-Q3J5c3RhbHM._4-w6a}

Many compounds form molecules, but ionic compounds form crystals
instead. A **crystal** consists of many alternating positive and
negative ions bonded together in a matrix. Look at the crystal of sodium
chloride (NaCl) in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDQ.) . The sodium and chloride ions
are attracted to each other because they are oppositely charged, so they
form ionic bonds.

### Naming Ionic Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-TmFtaW5nIElvbmljIENvbXBvdW5kcw.._4-w51}

Ionic compounds are named for their positive and negative ions. The name
of the positive ion always comes first, followed by the name of the
negative ion. For example, positive sodium ions and negative chloride
ions form the compound named sodium chloride. Similarly, positive
calcium ions and negative chloride ions form the compound named calcium
chloride.

**Q:** What is the name of the ionic compound that is composed of
positive barium ions and negative iodide ions?

**A:** The compound is named barium iodide.

### Properties of Ionic Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBJb25pYyBDb21wb3VuZHM._4-h7u}

The crystal structure of ionic compounds is strong and rigid. It takes a
lot of energy to break all those ionic bonds. As a result, ionic
compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points. You can see
the melting and boiling points of several different ionic compounds in
the **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-SW9uaWNDb21wb3VuZHNNZWx0aW5nQm9pbGluZw..) . To
appreciate how high they are, consider that the melting and boiling
points of water, which is *not* an ionic compound, are 0°C and 100°C,
respectively.

  Ionic Compound                 Melting Point (°C)   Boiling Point (°C)
  ------------------------------ -------------------- --------------------
  Sodium chloride (NaCl)         801                  1413
  Calcium chloride (CaCl ~2~ )   772                  1935
  Barium oxide (BaO)             1923                 2000
  Iron bromide (FeBr ~3~ )       684                  934

  :  Melting and Boiling Points of a Few Ionic Compounds

Solid ionic compounds are poor conductors of electricity. The strong
bonds between their oppositely charged ions lock them into place in the
crystal. Therefore, the charged particles cannot move freely and carry
electric current, which is a flow of charge. But all that changes when
ionic compounds dissolve in water. When they dissolve, they separate
into individual ions. The ions can move freely, so they can carry
current. Dissolved ionic compounds are called electrolytes.

The rigid crystals of ionic compounds are brittle. They are more likely
to break than bend when struck. As a result, ionic crystals tend to
shatter easily. Try striking salt crystals with a hammer and you’ll find
that they readily break into smaller pieces. You can learn more about
the properties of ionic compounds by watching the video at this URL:

### Uses of Ionic Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBJb25pYyBDb21wb3VuZHM._4-jit}

Ionic compounds have many uses. Some are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMy0xLTUtQ29tcG91bmRz) . Many ionic
compounds are used in industry. The human body needs several ions for
good health. Having low levels of the ions can endanger important
functions such as heartbeat. Solutions of ionic compounds can be used to
restore the ions.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-lpe}

-   Ionic compounds consist of oppositely charged ions that are held
    together by ionic bonds. The opposite charges cancel out so ionic
    compounds have a net neutral charge. Ionic compounds form when
    metals transfer valence electrons to nonmetals.
-   Ionic compounds exist as crystals rather than molecules. A crystal
    consists of many alternating positive and negative ions bonded
    together in a matrix.
-   Ionic compounds are named for their positive metal ion first,
    followed by their negative nonmetal ion.
-   Ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points.
    They are good conductors of electricity but only when dissolved
    in water. Their crystals are rigid and brittle.
-   Ionic compounds have many uses in industry. They are also needed by
    humans and other living things.

In a tennis match, two players keep hitting the ball back and forth. The
ball bounces from one player to the other, over and over again. The ball
keeps the players moving together on the court. What if the two players
represented the nuclei of two atoms and the ball represented valence
electrons? What would the back and forth movement of the ball represent?
The answer is a covalent bond.

### Sharing Electrons {#4.html#x-ck12-U2hhcmluZyBFbGVjdHJvbnM._5-2in}

A **covalent bond** is the force of attraction that holds together two
atoms that share a pair of valence electrons. The shared electrons are
attracted to the nuclei of both atoms. This forms a molecule consisting
of two or more atoms. Covalent bonds form only between atoms of
nonmetals.

### Covalent Compounds and Diatomic Elements {#4.html#x-ck12-Q292YWxlbnQgQ29tcG91bmRzIGFuZCBEaWF0b21pYyBFbGVtZW50cw.._5-sv2}

The two atoms that are held together by a covalent bond may be atoms of
the same element or different elements. When atoms of different elements
form covalent bonds, a new substance, called a covalent compound,
results. Water is an example of a covalent compound. A water molecule is
modeled in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM18xXzZfV2F0ZXI.) . A molecule is the
smallest particle of a covalent compound that still has the properties
of the compound.

**Q:** How many valence electrons does the oxygen atom (O) share with
each hydrogen atom (H)? How many covalent bonds hold the water molecule
together?

**A:** The oxygen atom shares one pair of valence electrons with each
hydrogen atom. Each pair of shared electrons represents one covalent
bond, so two covalent bonds hold the water molecule together.

The diagram in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qm9uZGluZy10eXBlcy1veHlnZW4tQUxU) shows an
example of covalent bonds between two atoms of the same element, in this
case two atoms of oxygen. The diagram represents an oxygen molecule, so
it’s not a new compound. Oxygen normally occurs in diatomic (“two-atom”)
molecules. Several other elements also occur as diatomic molecules:
hydrogen, nitrogen, and all but one of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, and iodine). At the URL below, you can see an animation of
electron sharing in a molecule of chlorine.

**Q:** How many electrons do these two oxygen atoms share? How many
covalent bonds hold the oxygen molecule together?

**A:** The two oxygen atoms share two pairs of electrons, so two
covalent bonds hold the oxygen molecule together.

### Why Covalent Bonds Form {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IENvdmFsZW50IEJvbmRzIEZvcm0._5-i3d}

Covalent bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of
electrons. Look at the oxygen atoms in the **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-Qm9uZGluZy10eXBlcy1veHlnZW4tQUxU) . Alone, each
oxygen atom has six valence electrons. By sharing two pairs of valence
electrons, each oxygen atom has a total of eight valence electrons. This
fills its outer energy level, giving it the most stable arrangement of
electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to both oxygen nuclei, and
this force of attraction holds the two atoms together in the oxygen
molecule.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-by5}

-   A covalent bond is the force of attraction that holds together two
    atoms that share a pair of valence electrons. Covalent bonds form
    only between atoms of nonmetals.
-   The two atoms that are held together in a covalent bond may be atoms
    of the same element or different elements. When atoms of different
    elements bond together, it forms a covalent compound.
-   Covalent bonds form because the shared electrons fill each atom’s
    outer energy level and this is the most stable arrangement
    of electrons.

The burner on a gas stove burns with a pretty blue flame like the one
pictured in the opening image. The fuel burned by most gas stoves is
natural gas, which consists mainly of methane. Methane is a compound
that contains only carbon and hydrogen. Like many other compounds that
consist of just these two elements, methane is used for fuel because it
burns very easily. Methane is an example of a covalent compound.

### What Are Covalent Compounds? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQ292YWxlbnQgQ29tcG91bmRzPw.._6-iry}

Compounds that form from two or more nonmetallic elements, such as
carbon and hydrogen, are called **covalent compounds** . In a covalent
compound, atoms of the different elements are held together in molecules
by covalent bonds. These are chemical bonds in which atoms share valence
electrons. The force of attraction between the shared electrons and the
positive nuclei of both atoms holds the atoms together in the molecule.
A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent compound that still
has the properties of the compound.

The largest, most complex covalent molecules have thousands of atoms.
Examples include proteins and carbohydrates, which are compounds in
living things. The smallest, simplest covalent compounds have molecules
with just two atoms. An example is hydrogen chloride (HCl). It consists
of one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom, as you can see in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMy0xLTctSENs) . You can watch
an animation of hydrogen chloride forming at the following URL.

### Naming and Writing Formulas for Covalent Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-TmFtaW5nIGFuZCBXcml0aW5nIEZvcm11bGFzIGZvciBDb3ZhbGVudCBDb21wb3VuZHM._6-gmv}

To name simple covalent compounds, follow these rules:

-   Start with the name of the element closer to the left side of the
    periodic table.
-   Follow this with the name of element closer to the right of the
    periodic table. Give this second name the suffix *–ide* .
-   Use prefixes to represent the numbers of the different atoms in each
    molecule of the compound. The most commonly used prefixes are shown
    in the **Table** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-Q292YWxlbnRQcmVmaXhlcw..) .

  Number   Prefix
  -------- -----------------
  1        mono- (or none)
  2        di-
  3        tri-
  4        tetra-
  5        penta-
  6        hexa-

**Q:** What is the name of the compound that contains three oxygen atoms
and two nitrogen atoms?

**A:** The compound is named dinitrogen trioxide. Nitrogen is named
first because it is farther to the left in the periodic table than
oxygen. Oxygen is given the *-ide* suffix because it is the second
element named in the compound. The prefix *di-* is added to nitrogen to
show that there are two atoms of nitrogen in each molecule of the
compound. The prefix *tri-* is added to oxygen to show that there are
three atoms of oxygen in each molecule.

In the chemical formula for a covalent compound, the numbers of the
different atoms in a molecule are represented by subscripts. For
example, the formula for the compound named carbon dioxide is CO ~2~ .

**Q:** What is the chemical formula for dinitrogen trioxide?

**A:** The chemical formula is N ~2~ O ~3~ .

### Properties of Covalent Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBDb3ZhbGVudCBDb21wb3VuZHM._6-ih4}

The covalent bonds of covalent compounds are responsible for many of the
properties of the compounds. Because valence electrons are shared in
covalent compounds, rather than transferred between atoms as they are in
ionic compounds, covalent compounds have very different properties than
ionic compounds.

-   Many covalent compounds, especially those containing carbon and
    hydrogen, burn easily. In contrast, many ionic compounds do
    not burn.
-   Many covalent compounds do not dissolve in water, whereas most ionic
    compounds dissolve well in water.
-   Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds do not have freely moving
    electrons, so they cannot conduct electricity.
-   The individual molecules of covalent compounds are more easily
    separated than the ions in a crystal, so most covalent compounds
    have relatively low boiling points. This explains why many of them
    are liquids or gases at room temperature. You can compare the
    boiling points of some covalent and ionic compounds in the **Table**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG91bmRzQm9pbGluZ1BvaW50cw..) .

  Name of Compound(Chemical Formula)   Type of Compound   Boiling Point (°C)
  ------------------------------------ ------------------ --------------------
  Methane (CH ~4~ )                    covalent           -164
  Nitrogen oxide (NO)                  covalent           -152
  Sodium chloride (NaCl)               ionic              1413
  Lithium fluoride (LiF)               ionic              1676

**Q:** The two covalent compounds in the table are gases at room
temperature, which is 20°C. For a compound to be a liquid at room
temperature, what does its boiling point have to be?

**A:** To be a liquid at room temperature, a covalent compound has to
have a boiling point higher than 20°C. Water is an example of a covalent
compound that is a liquid at room temperature. The boiling point of
water is 100°C.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-rux}

-   Covalent compounds contain two or more nonmetallic elements held
    together by covalent bonds, in which atoms share pairs of
    valence electrons. A molecule is the smallest particle of a covalent
    compound that still has the properties of the compound.
-   A few rules can be applied to name simple covalent compounds: name
    the left-most element in the periodic table first, add *-ide* to the
    second named element, and use prefixes for the numbers of atoms.
-   Covalent bonds are responsible for many of the properties of
    covalent compounds. Covalent compounds have relatively low boiling
    points, cannot conduct electricity, and may not dissolve in water.

Like the north and south poles of a bar magnet, Earth’s north and south
magnetic poles—pictured above—are opposites in terms of their magnetic
fields. Some types of chemical bonds and chemical compounds have “poles”
similar to a bar magnet as well. But in the case of chemical bonds and
compounds, the poles are opposites in terms of their electric charge.
These bonds and compounds are described as polar.  

### Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgYW5kIE5vbnBvbGFyIENvdmFsZW50IEJvbmRz_7-bpk}

Covalent bonds are chemical bonds between atoms of nonmetals that share
valence electrons. In some covalent bonds, electrons are not shared
equally between the two atoms. These are called **polar** covalent
bonds. The **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDg.) shows the
polar bonds in a water molecule (H ~2~ O). The oxygen atom attracts the
shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do because the
nucleus of the oxygen atom has more positively charged protons. As a
result, the oxygen atom becomes slightly negative in charge, and the
hydrogen atoms become slightly positive in charge. For another example
of polar bonds, see the video at this URL:

In other covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally. These bonds are
called **nonpolar** covalent bonds. Neither atom attracts the shared
electrons more strongly. As a result, the atoms remain neutral in
charge. The oxygen (O ~2~ ) molecule in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MDk.) has two nonpolar bonds. The two

### Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgYW5kIE5vbnBvbGFyIENvdmFsZW50IENvbXBvdW5kcw.._7-ybx}

A covalent compound is a compound in which atoms are held together by
covalent bonds. If the covalent bonds are polar, then the covalent
compound as a whole may be polar. A polar covalent compound is one in
which there is a slight difference in electric charge between opposite
sides of the molecule. All polar compounds contain polar bonds. But
having polar bonds does not necessarily result in a polar compound. It
depends on how the atoms are arranged. This is illustrated in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MTA.) . In both molecules,
the oxygen atoms attract electrons more strongly than the carbon or
hydrogen atoms do, so both molecules have polar bonds. However, only
formaldehyde is a polar compound. Carbon dioxide is nonpolar.

**Q:** Why is carbon dioxide nonpolar?

**A:** The symmetrical arrangement of atoms in carbon dioxide results in
opposites sides of the molecule having the same charge.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-lty}

-   In polar covalent bonds, electrons are not shared equally between
    the two atoms, so one atom is slightly negative in charge and one is
    slightly positive in charge. In nonpolar covalent bonds, electrons
    are shared equally so the atoms remain neutral in charge.
-   Covalent compounds with polar bonds may be polar or nonpolar,
    depending on their arrangement of atoms.

The colorful red and blue model in the opening image represents a water
molecule. The molecule’s one oxygen atom is colored red, and its two
hydrogen atoms are colored blue. Can you guess why? The red color
represents negative electric charge, and the blue color represents
positive electric charge. The colors show that water is a polar
compound.

### What Are Polar Compounds? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgUG9sYXIgQ29tcG91bmRzPw.._8-bzp}

Polar compounds, such as water, are compounds that have a partial
negative charge on one side of each molecule and a partial positive
charge on the other side. All polar compounds contain polar bonds
(although not all compounds that contain polar bonds are polar.) In a
polar bond, two atoms share electrons unequally. One atom attracts the
shared electrons more strongly, so it has a partial negative charge. The
other atom attracts the shared electrons less strongly, so it is has a
partial positive charge. In a water molecule, the oxygen atom attracts
the shared electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. This
explains why the oxygen side of the water molecule has a partial
negative charge and the hydrogen side of the molecule has a partial
positive charge.

**Q:** If a molecule is polar, how might this affect its interactions
with nearby molecules of the same compound?

**A:** Opposite charges on different molecules of the same compound
might cause the molecules to be attracted to each other.

### Hydrogen Bonding {#4.html#x-ck12-SHlkcm9nZW4gQm9uZGluZw.._8-jk9}

Because of water’s polarity, individual water molecules are attracted to
one another. You can see this in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MTE.) . The positively charged
hydrogen side of one water molecule is attracted to the negatively
charged oxygen side of a nearby water molecule. This force of attraction
is called a **hydrogen bond** . You can watch hydrogen bonds forming
between water molecules in the animation at this URL:

Hydrogen bonds are intermolecular (“between-molecule”) bonds, rather
than intramolecular (“within-molecule”) bonds. They occur not only in
water but in other polar molecules in which positive hydrogen atoms are
attracted to negative atoms in nearby molecules. Hydrogen bonds are
relatively weak as chemical bonds go. For example, they are much weaker
than the bonds holding atoms together within molecules of covalent
compounds. To learn more about hydrogen bonding and when it occurs, see
the video at this URL:

### Hydrogen Bonds and Changes of State {#4.html#x-ck12-SHlkcm9nZW4gQm9uZHMgYW5kIENoYW5nZXMgb2YgU3RhdGU._8-gw3}

Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when
matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate
and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about
these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are
weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one
another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to
occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have
relatively high melting and boiling points. The **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Q292YWxlbnRNZWx0aW5nQm9pbGluZw..) compares
melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent
compounds.

  Name of Compound (Chemical Formula)   Polar or Nonpolar?   Melting Point(°C)   Boiling Point (°C)
  ------------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------- --------------------
  Methane (CH ~4~ )                     nonpolar             -182                -162
  Ethylene (C ~2~ H ~2~ )               nonpolar             -169                -104
  Ammonia (NH ~3~ )                     polar                -78                 -33
  Water (H ~2~ O)                       polar                0                   100

**Q:** Which compound in the **Table**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-Q292YWxlbnRNZWx0aW5nQm9pbGluZw..) do you think is
more polar, ammonia or water?

**A:** Water is more polar than ammonia. Its strong polarity explains
why its melting and boiling points are high even for a polar covalent
compound.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-b7q}

-   Polar covalent compounds have molecules with a partial negative
    charge on one side and a partial positive charge on the other side.
    This occurs because the compounds contain polar bonds. In a polar
    bond, one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the
    other atom does.
-   In some polar molecules that contain hydrogen atoms, the partial
    positive charge of the hydrogen atoms of one molecule are attracted
    to the partial negative charge of an atom of a nearby molecule. This
    force of attraction is called a hydrogen bond.
-   Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, but they add to the energy
    needed for molecules to move apart from each other when matter
    changes state from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas.
    This explains why polar covalent compounds have relatively high
    melting and boiling points.

The thick, rigid trunk of the oak tree on the left might crack and break
in a strong wind. The slim, flexible trunk of the willow tree on the
right might bend without breaking. In one way, metals are like willow
trees. They can bend without breaking. That’s because metals form
special bonds called metallic bonds.

### What Are Metallic Bonds? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTWV0YWxsaWMgQm9uZHM__9-cr3}

**Metallic bonds** are forces of attraction between positive metal ions
and the valence electrons that are constantly moving around them (see
the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5U2NpLTA3MTI.) ). The valence
electrons include their own and those of other, nearby ions of the same
metal. The valence electrons of metals move freely in this way because
metals have relatively low electronegativity, or attraction to
electrons. The positive metal ions form a lattice-like structure held
together by all the metallic bonds. For an animated version of metallic
bonding, go to this URL:

Metallic bonds.

</div>

**Q:** Why do metallic bonds form only in elements that are metals? Why
don’t similar bonds form in elements that are nonmetals?

**A:** Metal atoms readily give up valence electrons and become positive
ions whenever they form bonds. When nonmetals bond together, the atoms
share valence electrons and do not become ions. For example, when oxygen
atoms bond together they form oxygen molecules in which two oxygen atoms
share two pairs of valence electrons equally, so neither atom becomes
charged.

### Metallic Bonds and the Properties of Metals {#4.html#x-ck12-TWV0YWxsaWMgQm9uZHMgYW5kIHRoZSBQcm9wZXJ0aWVzIG9mIE1ldGFscw.._9-uel}

The valence electrons surrounding metal ions are constantly moving. This
makes metals good conductors of electricity. The lattice-like structure
of metal ions is strong but quite flexible. This allows metals to bend
without breaking. Metals are both ductile (can be shaped into wires) and
malleable (can be shaped into thin sheets). You can learn more about
metallic bonds and the properties of metals at this URL:

**Q:** Look at the metalworker in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMzExMF9CbGFja3NtaXRo) . He’s hammering a
piece of hot iron in order to shape it. Why doesn’t the iron crack when
he hits it?

**A:** The iron ions can move within the “sea” of electrons around them.
They can shift a little closer together or farther apart without
breaking the metallic bonds between them. Therefore, the metal can bend
rather than crack when the hammer hits it.

Metals such as iron are useful for many purposes because of their unique
properties. For example, they can conduct electricity and bend without
breaking. However, pure metals may be less useful than mixtures of
metals with other elements. For example, adding a little carbon to iron
makes it much stronger. This mixture is called steel. Steel is so strong
that it can hold up huge bridges, like the one pictured above. Steel is
also used to make skyscrapers, cargo ships, cars, and trains. Steel is
an example of an alloy.

### What Are Alloys? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQWxsb3lzPw.._10-iea}

An **alloy** is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements.
The other elements may be metals, nonmetals, or both. An alloy is formed
by melting a metal and dissolving the other elements in it. The molten
solution is then allowed to cool and harden. Alloys generally have more
useful properties than pure metals. Several examples of alloys are
described and pictured below. You can learn about another alloy—the
amazing alloy called memory wire—at the following URL. If you have
braces on your teeth, you might even have this alloy in your mouth!

Brass saxophone: Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. It is softer than
bronze and easier to shape. It's also very shiny. Notice the curved
pieces in this shiny brass saxophone. Brass is used for shaping many
other curved objects, such as doorknobs and plumbing fixtures. Stainless
steel sink: Stainless steel is a type of steel that contains nickel and
chromium in addition to carbon and iron. It is shiny, strong, and
resistant to rusting. This makes it useful for sinks, eating utensils,
and other objects that are exposed to water. "Gold" bracelet: Pure gold
is relatively soft, so it is rarely used for jewelry. Most "gold"
jewelry is actually made of an alloy of gold, copper and silver. Bronze
statue: Bronze was the first alloy ever made. The earliest bronze dates
back many thousands of years. Bronze is a mixture of copper and tin.
Both copper and tin are relatively soft metals, but mixed together in
bronze they are much harder. Bronze has been used for statues, coins,
and other objects.

**Q:** Sterling silver is an alloy that is used to make fine jewelry.
What elements do you think sterling silver contains? What properties
might sterling silver have that make it more useful than pure silver?

**A:** Most sterling silver is about 93 percent silver and about 7
percent copper. Sterling silver is harder and stronger than pure silver,
while retaining the malleability and luster of pure silver.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-niz}

Does the term *chemical reaction* bring to mind an image like this one?
In the picture, a chemist is mixing chemicals in a lab. Many chemical
reactions take place in labs. However, most chemical reactions do not.
Where do they occur? They happen in the world all around you. They even
happen inside your own body. In fact, you are alive only because of the
many chemical reactions that constantly take place inside your cells.

### What Is a Chemical Reaction? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENoZW1pY2FsIFJlYWN0aW9uPw.._11-uon}

A **chemical reaction** is a process in which some substances change
into different substances. Substances that start a chemical reaction are
called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are
called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds.
Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, like the one
below, in which reactants (on the left) are connected by an arrow to
products (on the right).

Chemical reactions may occur quickly or slowly. Look at the two pictures
in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVhY3Rpb25z) . Both
represent chemical reactions. In the picture on the left, a reaction
inside a fire extinguisher causes foam to shoot out of the extinguisher.
This reaction occurs almost instantly. In the picture on the right, a
reaction causes the iron tool to turn to rust. This reaction occurs very
slowly. In fact, it might take many years for all of the iron in the
tool to turn to rust.

**Q:** What happens during a chemical reaction? Where do the reactants
go, and where do the products come from?

**A:** During a chemical reaction, chemical changes take place. Some
chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form.

### Same Atoms, New Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-U2FtZSBBdG9tcywgTmV3IEJvbmRz_11-y19}

The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same
atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the
atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in
the reactants. This happens because chemical bonds break in the
reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products.

Consider the chemical reaction in which water forms from oxygen and
hydrogen gases. The **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2F0ZXJGb3JtaW5nLUNoZW1SeG5PdmVydmlldw..)
represents this reaction. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and
oxygen, and then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants
and products there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, but the
atoms are combined differently in water. You can see another example at
this URL:

### Types of Chemical Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQ2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25z_11-5ov}

The chemical reaction in the **Figure**

, in which water forms from hydrogen and oxygen, is an example of a
synthesis reaction. In this type of reaction, two or more reactants
combine to synthesize a single product. There are several other types of
chemical reactions, including decomposition, replacement, and combustion
reactions. The **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-UFMtMDgtMDEtY2hlbWljYWxfcmVhY3Rpb25z) compares
these four types of chemical reactions. You can see demonstrations of
each type at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVysOW0Lb8U](watch?v=nVysOW0Lb8U) .

  **Type of Reaction**   **General Equation**                     **Example**
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  Synthesis              A+B → C                                  2Na + Cl ~2~ → 2NaCl

**Q:** The burning of wood is a chemical reaction. Which type of
reaction is it?

**A:** The burning of wood—or of anything else—is a combustion reaction.
In the combustion example in the table, the fuel is methane gas (CH ~4~
).

### Energy In and Energy Out {#4.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IEluIGFuZCBFbmVyZ3kgT3V0_11-xeq}

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in
reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In
terms of energy, there are two types of chemical reactions: endothermic
reactions and exothermic reactions.

-   In exothermic reactions, more energy is released when bonds form in
    products than is used to break bonds in reactants. These reactions
    release energy to the environment, often in the form of heat
    or light.
-   In endothermic reactions, more energy is used to break bonds in
    reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These
    reactions absorb energy from the environment.

**Q:** When it comes to energy, which type of reaction is the burning of
wood? Is it an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction? How can
you tell?

**A:** The burning of wood is an exothermic reaction. You can tell by
the heat and light energy given off by a wood fire.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-6eb}

-   A chemical reaction is a process in which some substances, called
    reactants, change into different substances, called products. During
    the reaction, chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical
    bonds form in the products.
-   Types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition,
    replacement, and combustion reactions.
-   All chemical reactions involve energy. Exothermic reactions release
    more energy than they use. Endothermic reactions use more energy
    than they release.

Did you ever wonder what happens to a candle when it burns? A candle
burning is a chemical change in matter. In a chemical change, one type
of matter changes into a different type of matter, with different
chemical properties. Chemical changes occur because of chemical
reactions. You can see more examples of chemical changes at this URL:

### From Reactants to Products {#4.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBSZWFjdGFudHMgdG8gUHJvZHVjdHM._12-sbq}

All chemical reactions—including a candle burning—involve reactants and
products.

-   **Reactants** are substances that start a chemical reaction.
-   **Products** are substances that are produced in the reaction.

When a candle burns, the reactants are fuel (the candlewick and wax) and
oxygen (in the air). The products are carbon dioxide gas and water
vapor.

### Relating Reactants and Products {#4.html#x-ck12-UmVsYXRpbmcgUmVhY3RhbnRzIGFuZCBQcm9kdWN0cw.._12-432}

The relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction
can be represented by a chemical equation that has this general form:

<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-ukt">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-tbu">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-cmd">
<dd>
Reactants → Products

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
The arrow (→) shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. In many
reactions, the reaction also occurs in the opposite direction. This is
represented with another arrow pointing in the opposite direction (←).

**Q:** Write a general chemical equation for the reaction that occurs
when a fuel such as candle wax burns.

**A:** The burning of fuel is a combustion reaction. The general
equation for this type of reaction is:

<dl id="x-ck12-ZDY4NmUwMzM4MDU5YTNlN2E4NGJjOTVlNmU1MDRmYmE.-wil">

<dd>
Fuel + O ~2~ → CO ~2~ + H ~2~ O

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** How do the reactants in a chemical reaction turn into the
products?

**A:** Bonds break in the reactants, and new bonds form in the products.

### Breaking and Making Chemical Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-QnJlYWtpbmcgYW5kIE1ha2luZyBDaGVtaWNhbCBCb25kcw.._12-ovi}

The reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same
atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the
atoms end up in different combinations in the products. This makes the
products new substances that are chemically different from the
reactants.

Consider the example of water forming from hydrogen and oxygen. Both
hydrogen and oxygen gases exist as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules.
These molecules are the reactants in the reaction. The **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2F0ZXJGb3JtaW5nLVJlYWN0YW50c1Byb2R1Y3Rz)
shows that bonds must break to separate the atoms in the hydrogen and
oxygen molecules. Then new bonds must form between hydrogen and oxygen
atoms to form water molecules. The water molecules are the products of
the reaction.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-lk7}

-   All chemical reactions involve both reactants and products.
    Reactants are substances that start a chemical reaction, and
    products are substances that are produced in the reaction.
-   A chemical reaction can be represented by the general chemical
    formula: ![\\text{Reactants} \\rightarrow
    \\text{Products}](ck12_math_images_dir/62fa5cc10e8450a2408ee4d05527c682.png) .
-   Bonds break and reform during chemical reactions. Reactants and
    products contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the
    reaction, so reactants and products are different substances.

This diagram represents a chemical reaction. In the reaction, two
molecules of hydrogen gas (2 H-H) combine one molecule of oxygen gas
(O=O) to produce two molecules of water (2 H-O-H). Look at the arrow in
the diagram. What does it represent? It shows that the reaction normally
occurs in that direction, that is, from the two gases to water. Does the
opposite reaction ever occur? Can water change back to hydrogen and
oxygen gases? In other words, is the reaction reversible? Read on to
find out.

### Irreversible Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-SXJyZXZlcnNpYmxlIFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._13-xgj}

Some chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. These reactions
are called irreversible reactions. The reactants can change to the
products, but the products cannot change back to the reactants. These
reactions are like making a cake. The ingredients of a cake—such as eggs
and flour—are the reactants. They are mixed together and baked to form
the cake, which is the product (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FrZVJlYWN0aW9u) ). The cake can’t be
“unbaked” and “unmixed” to change it back to the raw eggs, flour, and
other ingredients. So making a cake is irreversible.

Combustion reactions are generally irreversible. Combustion occurs
whenever a fuel burns. In this type of reaction, the fuel may combine
with oxygen (in the air) and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor.
The chemical equation for a combustion reaction is:

<dl id="x-ck12-ZDY4NmUwMzM4MDU5YTNlN2E4NGJjOTVlNmU1MDRmYmE.-hkq">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ZDY4NmUwMzM4MDU5YTNlN2E4NGJjOTVlNmU1MDRmYmE.-7ax">

<dd>
Fuel + O ~2~ → CO ~2~ + H ~2~ O

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
In a complete combustion reaction, fuel and oxygen are the reactants and
the products are carbon dioxide and water. These two products cannot
react to reform the fuel and oxygen, so the reaction is irreversible.
The one-way arrow in the equation shows that the reaction can go in only
one direction.

### Reversible Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-UmV2ZXJzaWJsZSBSZWFjdGlvbnM._13-jgp}

Many chemical reactions can occur in both directions. These reactions
are called reversible reactions. Not only can the reactants change to
the products, but the products can change back to the reactants, at
least under certain conditions. Consider again the reaction in which
hydrogen gas and oxygen gas combine to produce water. This reaction is
reversible if an electric current is applied to the water that is
produced. You can see how this is done in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMgUFMgMyAyIDMgd2F0ZXIgZGVjb21wb3NpdGlvbg..) .
The current causes the water molecules to break down to individual
hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Then these atoms recombine to form molecules
of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.

**Q:** In a chemical equation, a reversible reaction is represented with
two arrows, one pointing in each direction. This shows that the reaction
can go both ways. How would you represent the reversible reaction in
which hydrogen and oxygen gases combine to produce water?

### Balancing Act {#4.html#x-ck12-QmFsYW5jaW5nIEFjdA.._13-pyg}

In a reversible reaction, both forward and reverse directions of the
reaction generally occur at the same time. While reactants are reacting
to produce products, products are reacting to produce reactants. Often,
a point is reached at which forward and reverse directions of the
reaction occur at the same rate. When this happens, there is no overall
change in the amount of reactants and products, even though the
reactions keep occurring in both directions. This point is called
**equilibrium** . The term *equilibrium* means “state of balance,” and
it is used to refer to a state of balance between any opposing changes.
You can see an animation of a chemical reaction reaching equilibrium at
this URL:

.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-zcg}

-   Irreversible chemical reactions can occur in only one direction. The
    reactants can change to the products, but the products cannot change
    back to the reactants.
-   Reversible chemical reactions can occur in both directions. The
    reactants can change to the products, and the products can also
    change back to the reactants.
-   Equilibrium occurs when forward and reverse directions of a
    reversible reaction occur at the same rate so there is no overall
    change in the amounts of reactants and products.

Look at the girl’s hair in the photo above. It has obviously changed
color. The process in which this occurred involved chemical reactions.
How do you know that chemical reactions have occurred? The change in
color is the most obvious clue.

### What’s Your Sign? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgWW91ciBTaWduPw.._14-lfr}

A change in color is just one of several potential signs that a chemical
reaction has occurred. Other potential signs include:

-   Change in temperature-Heat is released or absorbed during
    the reaction.
-   Production of a gas-Gas bubbles are released during the reaction.
-   Production of a solid-A solid settles out of a liquid solution. The
    solid is called a precipitate.

Look at this rusty bike. It has been left outside in damp weather too
many times, so the iron in the metal parts has rusted. Iron rusts when
it combines with oxygen in the air. Iron rusting is an example of a
chemical reaction. In a chemical reaction, substances change into
entirely different substances. For example, the iron in the bike and the
oxygen in the air have changed into rust.

**Q:** How could you represent this reaction, besides just describing it
in words?

**A:** Scientists use a standard method to represent a chemical
reaction, called a chemical equation.

### What Is a Chemical Equation? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENoZW1pY2FsIEVxdWF0aW9uPw.._15-ifk}

A **chemical equation** is a shorthand way to sum up what occurs in a
chemical reaction. The general form of a chemical equation is:

<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-8dz">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-yed">

<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-i23">
<dd>
Reactants → Products

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
The reactants in a chemical equation are the substances that begin the
reaction, and the products are the substances that are produced in the
reaction. The reactants are always written on the left side of the
equation and the products on the right. The arrow pointing from left to
right shows that the reactants change into the products during the
reaction. This happens when chemical bonds break in the reactants and
new bonds form in the products. As a result, the products are different
chemical substances than the reactants that started the reaction. For a
good overview of chemical equations and how to write them, watch the
video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zC6v5gU0k4](watch?v=0zC6v5gU0k4) .

**Q:** What is the general equation for the reaction in which iron
rusts?

**A:** Iron combines with oxygen to produce rust, which is the compound
named iron oxide. This reaction could be represented by the general
chemical equation below. Note that when there is more than one reactant,
they are separated by plus signs (+). If more than one product were
produced, plus signs would be used between them as well.

### Using Chemical Symbols and Formulas {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgQ2hlbWljYWwgU3ltYm9scyBhbmQgRm9ybXVsYXM._15-d4v}

When scientists write chemical equations, they use chemical symbols and
chemical formulas instead of names to represent reactants and products.
Look at the chemical reaction illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM18yXzVfQ2FyYm9uX0Rpb3hpZGU.) . In this
reaction, carbon reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon is
represented by the chemical symbol C. The chemical symbol for oxygen is
O, but pure oxygen exists as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules,
represented by the chemical formula O ~2~ . A molecule of the compound
carbon dioxide consists of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen,
so carbon dioxide is represented by the chemical formula CO ~2~ .

**Q:** What is the chemical equation for this reaction?

**A:** The chemical equation is:

<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NmRiYjE5NDY4YTBkZDhmZjBhZWE1ZGE0ZmQ5MGZlMmU.-m7c">

<dd>
C + O ~2~ → CO ~2~

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** How have the atoms of the reactants been rearranged in the
products of the reaction? What bonds have been broken, and what new
bonds have formed?

**A:** Bonds between the oxygen atoms in the oxygen molecule have been
broken, and new bonds have formed between the carbon atom and the two
oxygen atoms.

### Is It Balanced? {#4.html#x-ck12-SXMgSXQgQmFsYW5jZWQ__15-xbd}

All chemical equations, like equations in math, must balance. This means
that there must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of
the arrow. That’s because matter is always conserved in a chemical
reaction. This is the law of conservation of mass.

Look at the equation above for the reaction between carbon and oxygen in
the formation of carbon dioxide. Count the number of atoms of each type.
Are the numbers the same on both sides of the arrow? The answer is yes,
so the equation is balanced.

### Coefficients {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29lZmZpY2llbnRz_15-2kk}

Let’s return to the chemical reaction in which iron (Fe) combines with
oxygen (O ~2~ ) to form rust, or iron oxide (Fe ~2~ O ~3~ ). The
equation for this reaction is:

<dl id="x-ck12-YWZmNGNkZGUwMDkyMmJhODA4M2M3ZDQwZGE2ZDlkN2E.-xbt">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YWZmNGNkZGUwMDkyMmJhODA4M2M3ZDQwZGE2ZDlkN2E.-ob3">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YWZmNGNkZGUwMDkyMmJhODA4M2M3ZDQwZGE2ZDlkN2E.-uvp">
<dd>
4Fe+ 3O ~2~ → 2Fe ~2~ O ~3~

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
This equation illustrates the use of coefficients to balance chemical
equations. A coefficient is a number placed in front of a chemical
symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the
substance are involved in the reaction. From the equation for rusting,
you can see that four atoms of iron combine with three molecules of
oxygen to form two molecules of iron oxide.

**Q:** Is the equation for the rusting reaction balanced? How can you
tell?

**A:** Yes, the equation is balanced. You can tell because there is the
same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow. First count
the iron atoms. There are four iron atoms in the reactants. There are
also four iron atoms in the products (two in each of the two iron oxide
molecules). Now count the oxygen atoms. There are six on each side of
the arrow, confirming that the equation is balanced in terms of oxygen
as well as iron.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-toi}

-   Scientists use chemical equations to summarize what happens in
    chemical reactions. Reactants are placed on the left side of the
    equation and products are placed on the right. An arrow is used to
    indicate the direction in which the reaction occurs. Plus signs (+)
    are placed between multiple reactants or products.
-   In chemical equations, reactants and products are represented by
    chemical symbols and formulas. Numbers called coefficients are
    placed in front of the symbols and formulas to show how much of each
    substance is involved in the reaction.
-   Chemical equations must be balanced. A balanced equation has the
    same number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation.

The little girl on this seesaw weighs more than the little boy on the
other side. That’s why her side of the seesaw is on the ground and his
side is up in the air. For a seesaw to balance, the two riders must be
the same weight. A chemical equation that represents a chemical reaction
is a little bit like a seesaw. For a chemical equation to balance, there
must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the
equation.

### Writing Chemical Equations {#4.html#x-ck12-V3JpdGluZyBDaGVtaWNhbCBFcXVhdGlvbnM._16-ygw}

A chemical equation represents the changes that occur during a chemical
reaction. A chemical equation has the general form:

<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-hbw">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NzZjNTUzN2I3NGMxMGFiYTNjOTM2NzdmYTI3YTBhM2E.-lon">

<dd>
Reactants → Products

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
An example of a simple chemical reaction is the reaction in which
hydrogen (H ~2~ ) and oxygen (O ~2~ ) combine to produce water (H ~2~
O). In this reaction, the reactants are hydrogen and oxygen and the
product is water. To write the chemical equation for this reaction, you
would start by writing the reactants on the left and the product on the
right, with an arrow between them to show the direction in which the
reaction occurs:

***Equation 1:***

H ~2~ + O ~2~ → H ~2~ O

**Q:** Look closely at equation 1. There’s something wrong with it. Do
you see what it is?

**A:** All chemical equations must be balanced. This means that there
must be the same number of each type of atom on both sides of the arrow.
That’s because mass is always conserved in chemical reactions. Count the
number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms on each side of the arrow. There are
two hydrogen atoms in both reactants and products. There are two oxygen
atoms in the reactants but only one in the product. Therefore, equation
1 is not balanced.

### Using Coefficients {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgQ29lZmZpY2llbnRz_16-wzv}

Coefficients are used to balance chemical equations. A coefficient is a
number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula. It shows how
many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction.
For example, two molecules of hydrogen would be written as 2 H ~2~ , and
two molecules of water would be written 2 H ~2~ O. A coefficient of 1
usually isn’t written. Coefficients can be used to balance equation 1
(above) as follows:

***Equation 2:***

2 H ~2~ + O ~2~ → 2 H ~2~ O

Equation 2 shows that two molecules of hydrogen react with one molecule
of oxygen to produce two molecules of water. The two molecules of
hydrogen each contain two hydrogen atoms and so do the two molecules of
water. Therefore, there are now four hydrogen atoms in both reactants
and products.

**Q:** Is equation 2 balanced?

**A:** Count the oxygen atoms to find out. There are two oxygen atoms in
the one molecule of oxygen in the reactants. There are also two oxygen
atoms in the products, one in each of the two water molecules.
Therefore, equation 2 is balanced.

### Steps in Balancing a Chemical Equation {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHMgaW4gQmFsYW5jaW5nIGEgQ2hlbWljYWwgRXF1YXRpb24._16-6c5}

Balancing a chemical equation involves a certain amount of trial and
error. In general, however, you should follow these steps:

1.  Count each type of atom in reactants and products. Does the same
    number of each atom appear on both sides of the arrow? If not, the
    equation is not balanced, and you need to go to step 2.
2.  Place coefficients, as needed, in front of the symbols or formulas
    to increase the number of atoms or molecules of the substances. Use
    the smallest coefficients possible. Warning! Never change the
    subscripts in chemical formulas. Changing subscripts changes the
    substances involved in the reaction. Change only the coefficients.
3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the equation is balanced.

**Q:** Balance this chemical equation for the reaction in which nitrogen
(N ~2~ ) and hydrogen (H ~2~ ) combine to form ammonia (NH ~3~ ):

<dl id="x-ck12-NzFjZjc0N2Q1ODRjMDM1ZTNhNDFkNTVjMDlhOGY1N2U.-cmp">

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**A:** First count the nitrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow. There
are two nitrogen atoms in the reactants so there must be two in the
products as well. Place the coefficient 2 in front of NH ~3~ to balance
nitrogen:

<dl id="x-ck12-ZDRkZWU1NjY4NmMzMTllNzdjYzM1ZjU4ODUyNDk2NmQ.-yde">

<dl id="x-ck12-ZDRkZWU1NjY4NmMzMTllNzdjYzM1ZjU4ODUyNDk2NmQ.-9of">

<dd>
N ~2~ + H ~2~ → 2 NH ~3~

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Now count the hydrogen atoms on both sides of the arrow. There are six
hydrogen atoms in the products so there must also be six in the
reactants. Place the coefficient 3 in front of H ~2~ to balance
hydrogen:

<dl id="x-ck12-MjA0NzQ3MWFiZDRkNjRkM2JhOWJkMGNlYmZiNTQ5ZDI.-wnv">

### Chemical Reactions and Balanced Equations {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25zIGFuZCBCYWxhbmNlZCBFcXVhdGlvbnM._17-kpo}

A chemical reaction occurs when some substances change chemically to
other substances. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical
equations. Consider a simple chemical reaction, the burning of methane.
In this reaction, methane (CH ~4~ ) combines with oxygen (O ~2~ ) in the
air and produces carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water vapor (H ~2~ O). The
reaction is represented by the following chemical equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-NTYwOWIwNTYzYzQ3MDdhNjY1NzlkNjY0ZTFjNjgyYWQ.-g8n">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NTYwOWIwNTYzYzQ3MDdhNjY1NzlkNjY0ZTFjNjgyYWQ.-vsl">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NTYwOWIwNTYzYzQ3MDdhNjY1NzlkNjY0ZTFjNjgyYWQ.-v3v">
<dd>
CH ~4~ + 2O ~2~ → CO ~2~ + 2H ~2~ O

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
This equation shows that one molecule of methane combines with two
molecules of oxygen to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide and two
molecules of water vapor. All chemical equations must be balanced. This
means that the same number of each type of atom must appear on both
sides of the arrow.

**Q:** Is the chemical equation for the burning of methane balanced?
Count the atoms of each type on both sides of the arrow to find out.

**A:** Yes, the equation is balanced. There is one carbon atom on both
sides of the arrow. There are also four hydrogen atoms and four oxygen
atoms on both sides of the arrow.

### Following the Law {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9sbG93aW5nIHRoZSBMYXc._17-09x}

Why must chemical equations be balanced? It’s the law! Matter cannot be
created or destroyed in chemical reactions. This is the **law of
conservation of mass** . In every chemical reaction, the same mass of
matter must end up in the products as started in the reactants. Balanced
chemical equations show that mass is conserved in chemical reactions.

### Lavoisier and Conservation of Mass {#4.html#x-ck12-TGF2b2lzaWVyIGFuZCBDb25zZXJ2YXRpb24gb2YgTWFzcw.._17-f8f}

How do scientists know that mass is always conserved in chemical
reactions? Careful experiments in the 1700s by a French chemist named
Antoine Lavoisier led to this conclusion. Lavoisier carefully measured
the mass of reactants and products in many different chemical reactions.
He carried out the reactions inside a sealed jar, like the one in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQW50b2luZQ..) . In every case,
the total mass of the jar and its contents was the same after the
reaction as it was before the reaction took place. This showed that
matter was neither created nor destroyed in the reactions. Another
outcome of Lavoisier’s research was the discovery of oxygen. You can
learn more about Lavoisier and his important research at:

</div>

**Q:** Lavoisier carried out his experiments inside a sealed glass jar.
Why was sealing the jar important for his results? What might his
results have been if he hadn’t sealed the jar?

**A:** Sealing the jar was important so that any gases produced in the
reactions were captured and could be measured. If he hadn’t sealed the
jar, gases might have escaped detection. Then his results would have
shown that there was less mass after the reactions than before. In other
words, he would not have been able to conclude that mass is conserved in
chemical reactions.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-ztw}

-   A chemical reaction occurs when some substances change chemically to
    other substances. Chemical reactions are represented by
    chemical equations.

In this photo of Los Angeles, California, the air over the city is brown
with smog. A major component of smog is nitrogen dioxide, which is a
toxic gas with a sharp odor. Nitrogen dioxide can irritate the eyes and
throat and trigger asthma attacks. Where does this poisonous gas come
from? It forms when nitric oxide—from sources such as car exhaust—reacts
with oxygen in the air. This reaction is a synthesis reaction.

### What Is a Synthesis Reaction? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFN5bnRoZXNpcyBSZWFjdGlvbj8._18-zj5}

A **synthesis reaction** occurs when two or more reactants combine to
form a single product. A synthesis reaction can be represented by the
general equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-OGFlMThkYTZhYWUzZjNkMjA1YTE2OWEwZTE5YjQ1ZTE.-bbu">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-OGFlMThkYTZhYWUzZjNkMjA1YTE2OWEwZTE5YjQ1ZTE.-epd">

<dd>
A + B → C

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
In this equation, the letters A and B represent the reactants that begin
the reaction, and the letter C represents the product that is
synthesized in the reaction. The arrow shows the direction in which the
reaction occurs.

**Q:** What is the chemical equation for the synthesis of nitrogen
dioxide (NO ~2~ ) from nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O ~2~ )?

### Examples of Synthesis Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgU3ludGhlc2lzIFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._18-6bt}

Another example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of sodium
(Na) and chlorine (Cl) to produce sodium chloride (NaCl). This reaction
is represented by the chemical equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-ODI3MmI3OTc2ZDgxNzAyYmU4OWM3NDQxZjIzOGI3YjI.-w0a">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ODI3MmI3OTc2ZDgxNzAyYmU4OWM3NDQxZjIzOGI3YjI.-k8l">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ODI3MmI3OTc2ZDgxNzAyYmU4OWM3NDQxZjIzOGI3YjI.-ep5">
<dd>
2Na + Cl ~2~ → 2NaCl

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Sodium is a highly reactive metal, and chlorine is a poisonous gas. Both
elements are pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU29kaXVtQ2hsb3JpZGUtU3ludGhlc2lzUnhu) .
The compound they synthesize has very different properties. Sodium
chloride is commonly called table salt, which is neither reactive nor
poisonous. In fact, salt is a necessary component of the human diet. You

Hydrogen peroxide is a widely used disinfectant for minor cuts and
scrapes. You may have a bottle of hydrogen peroxide like the one
pictured here in your medicine cabinet at home. Did you ever notice that
hydrogen peroxide is always kept in a dark brown bottle like this one?
Do you know why? The reason is that hydrogen peroxide needs to be
protected from light. If it isn’t, it will gradually break down to water
and oxygen. This is a decomposition reaction.  

### What Is a Decomposition Reaction? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIERlY29tcG9zaXRpb24gUmVhY3Rpb24__19-2vz}

A **decomposition reaction** occurs when one reactant breaks down into
two or more products. It can be represented by the general equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-N2I3MTIzNDhkYjVjZGZkZmMzZjgwNzUxM2Q4NWFjNzY.-ozt">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-N2I3MTIzNDhkYjVjZGZkZmMzZjgwNzUxM2Q4NWFjNzY.-jer">

<dl id="x-ck12-N2I3MTIzNDhkYjVjZGZkZmMzZjgwNzUxM2Q4NWFjNzY.-qnw">
<dd>
AB → A + B

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
In this equation, AB represents the reactant that begins the reaction,
and A and B represent the products of the reaction. The arrow shows the
direction in which the reaction occurs.

**Q:** What is the chemical equation for the decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide (H ~2~ O ~2~ ) to water (H ~2~ O) and oxygen (O ~2~ )?

**A:** The equation for this decomposition reaction is:

### Other Examples of Decomposition Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgRXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgRGVjb21wb3NpdGlvbiBSZWFjdGlvbnM._19-gs8}

Two more examples of decomposition reactions are described below. You
can see additional examples at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxlWtsFinTM](watch?v=dxlWtsFinTM)

-   Carbonic acid (H ~2~ CO ~3~ ) is an ingredient in soft drinks. A
    decomposition reaction takes place when carbonic acid breaks down to
    produce water (H ~2~ O) and carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ). This occurs
    when you open a can of soft drink and some of the carbon dioxide
    fizzes out. The equation for this reaction is:

-   Another decomposition reaction occurs when water (H ~2~ O) breaks
    down to produce hydrogen (H ~2~ ) and oxygen (O ~2~ ) gases (see
    **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGVjb21wb2ZXYXRlcg..) ).
    This happens when an electric current passes through the water, as

What a job! The man hanging from the burning helicopter in the photo
above is a stunt man. He fills in for the lead actor in the movie in
dangerous scenes like this one. Like other stunt workers, he has special
training to do such dangerous work as safely as possible. Replacing
actors with stunt workers is common in action movies. Some chemical
reactions also involve replacements. More reactive elements replace less
reactive elements in compounds. These reactions are called replacement
reactions.

### What Is a Replacement Reaction? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFJlcGxhY2VtZW50IFJlYWN0aW9uPw.._20-el8}

A **replacement reaction** occurs when elements switch places in
compounds. This type of reaction involves ions (electrically charged
versions of atoms) and ionic compounds. These are compounds in which
positive ions of a metal and negative ions of a nonmetal are held
together by ionic bonds. Generally, a more reactive element replaces an
element that is less reactive, and the less reactive element is set free
from the compound. There are two types of replacement reactions: single
and double. Both types are described below.

**Q:** Can you predict how single and double replacement reactions
differ?

**A:** One way they differ is that a single replacement reaction
involves one reactant compound, whereas a double replacement reaction
involves two reactant compounds. Keep reading to learn more about these
two types of reactions.

### Single Replacement Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-U2luZ2xlIFJlcGxhY2VtZW50IFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._20-wta}

A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another
in a single compound. This type of reaction has the general equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-MGYzOGNiMzZkMTg0ZjUxYTMxOTM3ZWJlNGM2YThlMWM.-qi0">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MGYzOGNiMzZkMTg0ZjUxYTMxOTM3ZWJlNGM2YThlMWM.-fmm">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MGYzOGNiMzZkMTg0ZjUxYTMxOTM3ZWJlNGM2YThlMWM.-fix">
<dd>
A + BC → B + AC

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
In this equation, A represents a more reactive element and BC represents
the original compound. During the reaction, A replaces B, forming the
product compound AC and releasing the less reactive element B.

An example of a single replacement reaction occurs when potassium (K)
reacts with water (H ~2~ O). A colorless solid compound named potassium
hydroxide (KOH) forms, and hydrogen gas (H ~2~ ) is set free. The
equation for the reaction is:

<dl id="x-ck12-MjI5MTkyZjU5Y2JkZjAyNzc1MTg4MjQxYmZmMzQ2NGI.-uyr">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MjI5MTkyZjU5Y2JkZjAyNzc1MTg4MjQxYmZmMzQ2NGI.-hly">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MjI5MTkyZjU5Y2JkZjAyNzc1MTg4MjQxYmZmMzQ2NGI.-dur">
<dd>
2K + 2H ~2~ O → 2KOH + H ~2~

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
In this reaction, a potassium ion replaces one of the hydrogen atoms in
each molecule of water. Potassium is a highly reactive group 1 alkali
metal, so its reaction with water is explosive. You can watch the
reaction occurring at this URL:
[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Potassium\_water\_20.theora.ogv](File:Potassium_water_20.theora.ogv)

**Q:** Find potassium in the periodic table of the elements. What other
element might replace hydrogen in water in a similar replacement
reaction?

**A:** Another group 1 element, such as lithium or sodium, might be
involved in a similar replacement reaction with water.

### Double Replacement Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-RG91YmxlIFJlcGxhY2VtZW50IFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._20-gay}

A double replacement reaction occurs when two ionic compounds exchange
ions. This produces two new ionic compounds. A double replacement
reaction can be represented by the general equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-NmMyNGZiYmE1MTJkZTg1MTZlOTgwZmRlNmE3OTMzZjY.-dir">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NmMyNGZiYmE1MTJkZTg1MTZlOTgwZmRlNmE3OTMzZjY.-7yz">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NmMyNGZiYmE1MTJkZTg1MTZlOTgwZmRlNmE3OTMzZjY.-uv0">
<dd>
AB + CD → AD + CB

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
AB and CD are the two reactant compounds, and AD and CB are the two
product compounds that result from the reaction. During the reaction,
the ions B and D change places.

**Q:** Could the product compounds be DA and BC?

**A:** No, they could not. In an ionic compound, the positive metal ion
is always written first, followed by the negative nonmetal ion.
Therefore, A and C must always come first, followed by D or B.

An example of a double replacement reaction is sodium chloride (NaCl)
reacting with silver fluoride (AgF). This reaction is represented by the
equation:

NaCl + AgF → NaF + AgCl

During the reaction, chloride and fluoride ions change places, so two
new compounds are formed in the products: sodium fluoride (NaF) and
silver chloride (AgCl). To better understand how and why double
replacement reactions occur, watch the video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eck\_s\_J6nKo](watch?v=eck_s_J6nKo)

**Q:** When iron sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) react
together, a double replacement reaction occurs. What are the products of
this reaction? What is the chemical equation for this reaction?

**A:** The products of the reaction are iron chloride (FeCl ~2~ ) and
hydrogen sulfide (H ~2~ S). The chemical equation for this reaction is:

FeS + 2HCl → H ~2~ S + FeCl ~2~

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-cpd}

-   A replacement reaction occurs when elements switch places
    in compounds. This type of reaction involves ions. Generally, more
    reactive elements replace less reactive elements.
-   A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces
    another element in one compound. This type of reaction is
    represented by: A + BC → B + AC.

Don’t try this at home! This performer isn’t really eating fire, but he
still puts on an impressive show. You know that fire is dangerous. It’s
hot, it can burn you, and it can easily get out of control. But do you
know what fire is? Fire is the result of a chemical reaction. Whenever
something burns, a type of reaction called a combustion reaction occurs.

### What Is a Combustion Reaction? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENvbWJ1c3Rpb24gUmVhY3Rpb24__21-y5e}

A **combustion reaction** occurs when a substance reacts quickly with
oxygen (O ~2~ ). For example, in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcmNvYWw.) , charcoal is combining
with oxygen. Combustion is commonly called burning, and the substance
that burns is usually referred to as fuel. The products of a complete
combustion reaction include carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water vapor (H
~2~ O). The reaction typically gives off heat and light as well. The
general equation for a complete combustion reaction is:

### Combustion of Hydrocarbons {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29tYnVzdGlvbiBvZiBIeWRyb2NhcmJvbnM._21-wzg}

The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction contains compounds called
hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon (C)
and hydrogen (H). The charcoal pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcmNvYWw.) consists of hydrocarbons.
So do fossil fuels such as natural gas. Natural gas is a fuel that is
commonly used in home furnaces and gas stoves. The main component of
natural gas is the hydrocarbon called methane (CH ~4~ ). You can see a
methane flame in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQnVybmVy)

The combustion of methane gas heats a pot on a stove.

</div>

**Q:** Sometimes the flame on a gas stove isn’t just blue but has some
yellow or orange in it. Why might this occur?

**A:** If the flame isn’t just blue, the methane isn’t getting enough
oxygen to burn completely, leaving some of the carbon unburned. The
flame will also not be as hot as a completely blue flame for the same
reason.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-is8}

-   A complete combustion reaction occurs when a fuel reacts quickly
    with oxygen (O ~2~ ) and produces carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water
    (H ~2~ O). The general equation for a complete combustion reaction
    is: Fuel + O ~2~ → CO ~2~ + H ~2~ O
-   The fuel that burns in a combustion reaction usually consists of
    hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). An
    example of a hydrocarbon is methane (CH ~4~ ), the main component of
    natural gas.

Did you ever use an instant ice pack like this one? You don’t have to
pre-cool it in the freezer. All you need to do is squeeze the pack and
it starts to get cold. How does this happen? The answer is an
endothermic chemical reaction.

### What Is an Endothermic Reaction {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFbmRvdGhlcm1pYyBSZWFjdGlvbg.._22-km9}

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in
reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In
some chemical reactions, called exothermic reactions, more energy is
released when new bonds form in the products than is needed to break
bonds in the reactants. The opposite is true of endothermic reactions.
In an **endothermic reaction** , it takes more energy to break bonds in
the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products.

### Energy Change in Endothermic Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IENoYW5nZSBpbiBFbmRvdGhlcm1pYyBSZWFjdGlvbnM._22-bia}

The word *endothermic* literally means “taking in heat.” A constant
input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed to keep an
endothermic reaction going. This is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW5kb3RoZXJtaWNHcmFwaA..) . Energy must
be constantly added because not enough energy is released when the
products form to break more bonds in the reactants. The general equation
for an endothermic reaction is:

Note: ΔH represents the change in energy.

</div>

In endothermic reactions, the temperature of the products is typically
lower than the temperature of the reactants. The drop in temperature may
be great enough to cause liquids to freeze. That’s what happens in the
endothermic reaction at this URL:
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add\_aqa\_pre\_2011/chemreac/energychangesrev1.shtml](energychangesrev1.shtml)
.

**Q:** Now can you guess how an instant cold pack works?

**A:** Squeezing the cold pack breaks an inner bag of water, and the
water mixes with a chemical inside the pack. The chemical and water
combine in an endothermic reaction. The energy needed for the reaction
to take place comes from the water, which gets colder as the reaction
proceeds.

### Photosynthesis {#4.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXM._22-u6x}

One of the most important series of endothermic reactions is
photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, plants make the simple sugar glucose
(C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ) from carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water (H ~2~ O).
They also release oxygen (O ~2~ ) in the process. The reactions of
photosynthesis are summed up by this chemical equation:

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
The energy for photosynthesis comes from light. Without light energy,
photosynthesis cannot occur. As you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGxhbnRz) , plants can get the energy
they need for photosynthesis from either sunlight or artificial light.

This mushroom cloud was produced in a 1953 nuclear bomb test in Nevada.
There’s no doubt that the explosion gave off a huge amount of energy.
Although not as impressive as nuclear reactions, many chemical reactions
also give off energy. These reactions are called exothermic reactions.

### What Is an Exothermic Reaction? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFeG90aGVybWljIFJlYWN0aW9uPw.._23-meb}

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in
reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. In
some chemical reactions, called endothermic reactions, less energy is
released when new bonds form in the products than is needed to break
bonds in the reactants. The opposite is true of exothermic reactions. In
an **exothermic reaction** , it takes less energy to break bonds in the
reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products.

### Energy Change in Exothermic Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IENoYW5nZSBpbiBFeG90aGVybWljIFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._23-dt6}

The word *exothermic*  means “releasing heat.” Energy, often in the form
of heat, is released as an exothermic reaction proceeds. This is
illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfRXhvdGhlbWljUmVhY3Rpb24.) . The general
equation for an exothermic reaction is:

*Note:* ΔH represents the change in energy.

</div>

If the energy produced in an exothermic reaction is released as heat, it
results in a rise in temperature. As a result, the products are likely
to be warmer than the reactants. That’s what happens in the exothermic
reaction at the URL below.

**Q:** You turn on the hot water faucet, and hot water pours out. How
does the water get hot? Do you think that an exothermic reaction might
be involved?

**A:** A hot water heater increases the temperature of water in most
homes. Many hot water heaters burn a fuel such as natural gas. The
burning fuel causes the water to get hot because combustion is an
exothermic reaction.

### Combustion as an Exothermic Reaction {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29tYnVzdGlvbiBhcyBhbiBFeG90aGVybWljIFJlYWN0aW9u_23-qe2}

All combustion reactions are exothermic reactions. During a combustion
reaction, a substance burns as it combines with oxygen. When substances
burn, they usually give off energy as heat and light. Look at the big
bonfire in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm9uZmlyZQ..) .
The combustion of wood is an exothermic reaction that releases a lot of
energy as heat and light. You can see the light energy the fire is
giving off. If you were standing near the fire, you would also feel its
heat.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._23-krl}

-   An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction in which less energy
    is needed to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new
    bonds form in the products.
-   During an exothermic reaction, energy is constantly given off, often
    in the form of heat.

The blue flame in this photo is burning inside a home furnace. The fuel
is natural gas, and it combines with oxygen when it burns. This chemical
reaction, called a combustion reaction, gives off a lot of energy.

### Energy and Chemical Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IGFuZCBDaGVtaWNhbCBSZWFjdGlvbnM._24-1rp}

All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds in
reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form in products. Like
the combustion reaction in a furnace, some chemical reactions require
less energy to break bonds in reactants than is released when bonds form
in products. These reactions, called exothermic reactions, release
energy. In other chemical reactions, it takes more energy to break bonds
in reactants than is released when bonds form in products. These
reactions, called endothermic reactions, absorb energy.

### Conservation of Energy {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmF0aW9uIG9mIEVuZXJneQ.._24-hnn}

Whether a chemical reaction absorbs or releases energy, there is no
overall change in the amount of energy during the reaction. That’s
because energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is the **law of
conservation of energy** . Energy may change form during a chemical
reaction—for example, from chemical energy to heat energy when gas burns
in a furnace—but the same amount of energy remains after the reaction as
before. This is true of all chemical reactions. You can learn more about
the law of conservation of energy at this URL:
[http://www.fi.edu/guide/hughes/energyconservation.html](energyconservation.html)
.

**Q:** If energy can’t be destroyed during a chemical reaction, what
happens to the energy that is absorbed in an endothermic reaction?

**A:** The energy is stored in the bonds of the products as chemical
energy. In an endothermic reaction, the products have more stored
chemical energy than the reactants. This is represented by the graph on
the left in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXhvYW5kRW5kbw..) . In an exothermic
reaction, the opposite is true. The products have less stored chemical
energy than the reactants. You can see this in the graph on the right in
the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXhvYW5kRW5kbw..) .

Note: ΔH represents the change in energy.

</div>

**Q:** What happens to the excess energy in the reactants of an
exothermic reaction?

**A:** The excess energy is generally released to the surroundings when
the reaction occurs. In a home heating system, for example, the energy
that is released during combustion in the furnace is used to heat the
home.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-cyf}

-   All chemical reactions involve energy. Energy is used to break bonds
    in reactants, and energy is released when new bonds form
    in products. Endothermic reactions absorb energy, and exothermic
    reactions release energy.

These cheerleaders have a lot of energy! Their role is to get the fans
as excited as they are so everyone will cheer for the team. They use
their energy to activate the crowd.  

### Getting Started {#4.html#x-ck12-R2V0dGluZyBTdGFydGVk_25-nlr}

Chemical reactions also need energy to be activated. They require a
certain amount of energy just to get started. This energy is called
**activation energy** . For example, activation energy is needed to
start a car engine. Turning the key causes a spark that activates the
burning of gasoline in the engine. The combustion of gas won’t occur
without the spark of energy to begin the reaction.

**Q:** Why is activation energy needed? Why won’t a reaction occur
without it?

**A:** A reaction won’t occur unless atoms or molecules of reactants
come together. This happens only if the particles are moving, and
movement takes energy. Often, reactants have to overcome forces that
push them apart. This takes energy as well. Still more energy is needed
to start breaking bonds in reactants.

### Activating Endothermic and Exothermic Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-QWN0aXZhdGluZyBFbmRvdGhlcm1pYyBhbmQgRXhvdGhlcm1pYyBSZWFjdGlvbnM._25-r94}

Some chemical reactions need a constant input of energy to take place.
They are called endothermic reactions. Other chemical reactions release
energy when they occur, so they can keep going without any added energy.
They are called exothermic reactions.

**Q:** It makes sense that endothermic reactions need activation energy.
But do exothermic reactions also need activation energy?

**A:** All chemical reactions need energy to get started, even
exothermic reactions. Look at the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW5kb2FuZEV4b0NvbG9y) . They compare
energy changes that occur during endothermic and exothermic reactions.
From the graphs, you can see that both types of reactions need the same
amount of activation energy in order to get started. Only after it
starts does the exothermic reaction produce more energy than it uses.

</div>

### A Common Example {#4.html#x-ck12-QSBDb21tb24gRXhhbXBsZQ.._25-xjx}

You have probably used activation energy to start a chemical reaction.
For example, if you’ve ever struck a match to light it, then you
provided the activation energy needed to start a combustion reaction.
When you struck the match on the box, the friction started the match
head burning. Combustion is exothermic. Once a match starts to burn, it
releases enough energy to activate the next reaction, and the next, and
so on. However, the match won’t burst into flames on its own.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-l0h}

-   All chemical reactions, including exothermic reactions, need
    activation energy to get started.
-   Activation energy is needed so reactants can move together, overcome
    forces of repulsion, and start breaking bonds.

Sodium reacts violently with water. That’s what is happening in the
picture above. Why does sodium have such explosive reactions? It’s
because the reactions occur so quickly.

### How Fast Does It Go? {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IEZhc3QgRG9lcyBJdCBHbz8._26-xpd}

How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the **reaction rate** .
Several factors affect the rate of a given chemical reaction. They
include the:

-   temperature of reactants.
-   concentration of reactants.
-   surface area of reactants.
-   presence of a catalyst.

At the following URL, you can see animations showing how these factors
affect the rate of chemical reactions.

[http://www.kentchemistry.com/links/Kinetics/FactorsAffecting.htm](FactorsAffecting.htm)

### Temperature of Reactants {#4.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgb2YgUmVhY3RhbnRz_26-a30}

When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is
faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy,
so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one
another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils
because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at
higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQnJlYWQ.) ). This is why we store foods
in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQnJlYWQ.) ). The lower
temperature slows the rate of spoilage.

### Concentration of Reactants {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29uY2VudHJhdGlvbiBvZiBSZWFjdGFudHM._26-mf8}

**Concentration** is the number of particles of a substance in a given
volume. When the concentration of reactants is higher, the reaction rate
is faster. At higher concentrations, particles of reactants are crowded
closer together, so they are more likely to collide and react. Did you
ever see a sign like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTm9TbW9raW5n) ? You might see it where
someone is using a tank of pure oxygen for a breathing problem.
Combustion, or burning, is a chemical reaction in which oxygen is a
reactant. A greater concentration of oxygen in the air makes combustion
more rapid if a fire starts burning.

**Q:** It is dangerous to smoke or use open flames when oxygen is in
use. Can you explain why?

**A:** Because of the higher-than-normal concentration of oxygen, the
flame of a match, lighter, or cigarette could spread quickly to other
materials or even cause an explosion.

### Surface Area of Reactants {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBBcmVhIG9mIFJlYWN0YW50cw.._26-l5u}

When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the
matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a
solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react.
Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the
reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUnVzdHk.) . Both are made of iron and
will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the
nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster.

### Presence of a Catalyst {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJlc2VuY2Ugb2YgYSBDYXRhbHlzdA.._26-tlq}

Some reactions need extra help to occur quickly. They need another
substance called a catalyst. A **catalyst** is a substance that
increases the rate of a chemical reaction. A catalyst isn’t a reactant,
so it isn’t changed or used up in the reaction. Therefore, it can
catalyze many other reactions.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-ihy}

-   How fast a chemical reaction occurs is called the reaction rate.

The tunnel through this mountain provides a faster route for cars to get
to the other side of the mountain. If a chemical reaction were like a
road to the other side of a mountain, a catalyst would be like a tunnel.
 

### What Is a Catalyst? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENhdGFseXN0Pw.._27-thi}

A **catalyst** is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical
reaction. The presence of a catalyst is one of several factors that
influence the rate of chemical reactions. (Other factors include the
temperature, concentration, and surface area of reactants.) A catalyst
isn’t a reactant in the chemical reaction it speeds up. As a result, it
isn’t changed or used up in the reaction, so it can go on to catalyze
many more reactions.

**Q:** How is a catalyst like a tunnel through a mountain?

**A:** Like a tunnel through a mountain, a catalyst provides a faster
pathway for a chemical reaction to occur.

### How Catalysts Work {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IENhdGFseXN0cyBXb3Jr_27-4o8}

Catalysts interact with reactants so the reaction can occur by an
alternate pathway that has a lower activation energy. Activation energy
is the energy needed to start a reaction. When activation energy is
lower, more reactant particles have enough energy to react so the
reaction goes faster. Many catalysts work like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM18yXzE3X0FjdGl2YXRpb24.) . (You can see
an animated version at the following URL.) The catalyst brings the
reactants together by temporarily bonding with them. This makes it
easier and quicker for the reactants to react together. Notice how the
catalyst is released by the product molecule at the end of the reaction.

**Q:** In the **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM18yXzE3X0FjdGl2YXRpb24.) , look at the
energy needed in the catalytic and non-catalytic pathways of the
reaction. How does the amount of energy compare? How does this affect
the reaction rate along each pathway?

**A:** The catalytic pathway of the reaction requires far less energy.
Therefore, the reaction will occur faster by this pathway because more
reactants will have enough energy to react.

### Catalysts in Living Things {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2F0YWx5c3RzIGluIExpdmluZyBUaGluZ3M._27-d5x}

Chemical reactions constantly occur inside living things. Many of these
reactions require catalysts so they will occur quickly enough to support
life. Catalysts in living things are called enzymes. Enzymes may be
extremely effective. A reaction that takes a split second to occur with
an enzyme might take many years without it!

More than 1000 different enzymes are necessary for human life. Many
enzymes are needed for the digestion of food. An example is amylase,
which is found in the mouth and small intestine. Amylase catalyzes the
breakdown of starch to sugar. You can see how it affects the rate of
starch digestion in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMy0yLTE3LUFteWxhc2U.) .

**Q:** If you chew a starchy food such as a soda cracker for a couple of

taste the reaction.

Spiral structures like the one pictured here could replace batteries in
the future because they can store energy like a spring and conduct
electricity. The structure is a tiny nanotube that consists entirely of
carbon atoms. Carbon nanotubes are made in labs, but carbon-based
compounds are also the most common naturally occurring compounds on
Earth. More than 90 percent of all known compounds contain carbon. Do
you know why carbon is found in so many compounds? Read on to find out.

### Carbon, Carbon Everywhere {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uLCBDYXJib24gRXZlcnl3aGVyZQ.._28-urx}

Carbon is a very common “ingredient” of matter because it can combine
with itself and with many other elements. It can form a great diversity
of compounds, ranging in size from just a few atoms to thousands of
atoms. There are millions of known carbon compounds, and carbon is the
only element that can form so many different compounds. You can find a
good introduction to carbon and its chemistry at this URL:

### Valence Electrons in Carbon {#4.html#x-ck12-VmFsZW5jZSBFbGVjdHJvbnMgaW4gQ2FyYm9u_28-m0y}

Carbon is a nonmetal in group 14 of the periodic table. Like other group
14 elements, carbon has four valence electrons. Valence electrons are
the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom that are involved in
chemical bonds. The valence electrons of carbon are shown in the
electron dot diagram in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMzMzEtQ2FyYm9u) .

</div>

**Q:** How many more electrons does carbon need to have a full outer
energy level?

**A:** Carbon needs four more valence electrons, or a total of eight
valence electrons, to fill its outer energy level. A full outer energy
level is the most stable arrangement of electrons.

**Q:** How can carbon achieve a full outer energy level?

**A:** Carbon can form four covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are chemical
bonds that form between nonmetals. In a covalent bond, two atoms share a
pair of electrons. By forming four covalent bonds, carbon shares four
pairs of electrons, thus filling its outer energy level and achieving
stability.

### How Carbon Forms Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IENhcmJvbiBGb3JtcyBCb25kcw.._28-i6v}

A carbon atom can form covalent bonds with other carbon atoms or with
the atoms of other elements. Carbon often forms bonds with hydrogen.
Compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons.
Methane (CH ~4~ ), which is modeled in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMzMzEtTWV0aGFuZQ..) , is an example of a
hydrocarbon. In methane, a single carbon atom forms covalent bonds with
four hydrogen atoms. The diagram on the left in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMzMzEtTWV0aGFuZQ..) shows all the shared
valence electrons. The diagram on the right in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMzMzEtTWV0aGFuZQ..) , called a structural
formula, represents each pair of shared electrons with a dash (–).

### Carbon-Carbon Bonds {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uLUNhcmJvbiBCb25kcw.._28-npg}

Carbon can form single, double, or even triple bonds with other carbon
atoms. In a single bond, two carbon atoms share one pair of electrons.
In a double bond, they share two pairs of electrons, and in a triple
bond they share three pairs of electrons. Examples of compounds with
these types of bonds are represented by the structural formulas in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMzMzEtQ2FyYm9uQm9uZHM.) .

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._28-0bv}

-   Carbon forms covalent bonds with atoms of carbon or other elements.
    There is a great diversity of carbon compounds, ranging in size from
    just one to thousands of atoms.
-   Carbon has four valence electrons, so it can achieve a full outer

You probably recognize this image as the great seal of the United
States. The motto on the seal, *E pluribus unum* , is Latin for “out of
many, one.” It refers to the formation of one country out of many
states. Large carbon compounds could have the same motto. Can you guess
why? In this lesson, you’ll find out.

### Out of Many, One {#4.html#x-ck12-T3V0IG9mIE1hbnksIE9uZQ.._29-gfr}

Carbon has a unique ability to form covalent bonds with many other
atoms. It can bond with other carbon atoms as well as with atoms of
other elements. Because of this ability, carbon often forms polymers. A
**polymer** is a large molecule that is made out of many smaller
molecules that are joined together by covalent bonds. The smaller,
repeating molecules are called **monomers** . (The prefix *mono* - means
“one” and the prefix *poly* - means “many.”) Polymers may consist of
just one type of monomer or of more than one type. Polymers are similar
to the strings of beads pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmVhZHM.) . Like beads on a string,
monomers in a polymer may be all the same or different from one another.

### Natural Carbon Polymers {#4.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBDYXJib24gUG9seW1lcnM._29-tfu}

Many polymers of carbon occur naturally. Two examples are rubber and
cellulose.

-   Rubber is a natural polymer of the monomer named isoprene (C ~5~ H
    ~8~ ). This polymer comes from rubber trees, which grow in
    tropical areas. Structural formulas for rubber and isoprene are
    shown in the **Figure**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUG9seW1lcnM.) . Note that just a
    small section of the rubber polymer is represented by the
    structural formula.
-   Cellulose is a natural polymer of the monomer named glucose (C ~6~ H
    ~12~ O ~6~ ). This polymer makes up the cell walls of plants and is
    the most common compound in living things. Structural formulas for
    cellulose and glucose are also shown in the **Figure**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUG9seW1lcnM.) ). As you can see from
    the structural formula for cellulose, when two glucose monomers bond
    together, a molecule of water (H ~2~ O) is released.

### Synthetic Carbon Polymers {#4.html#x-ck12-U3ludGhldGljIENhcmJvbiBQb2x5bWVycw.._29-fuy}

Synthetic carbon polymers are produced in labs or factories. Plastics
are common examples of synthetic carbon polymers. You are probably
familiar with the plastic called polyethylene. All of the plastic items

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-t4o}

-   Carbon has a unique ability to form many covalent bonds, so it often
    forms polymers. A polymer is a large molecule that is made up of
    many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers, which are joined
    together by covalent bonds.
-   Natural polymers include rubber and cellulose. Synthetic polymers
    include plastics such as polyethylene.

How annoying! Just as you start to write in your notebook, your pencil
lead breaks. Actually, pencil “leads” aren’t made of lead at all. They
are made of a form of carbon called graphite. How carbon atoms are
arranged in graphite explains why it’s suitable for writing—and also why
it breaks so easily.

**Q:** Graphite is one of several forms of carbon. How can a single
element exist in different forms?

**A:** Carbon can exist in different forms because atoms of carbon can
combine in different ways.

### What Are the Forms of Carbon? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgdGhlIEZvcm1zIG9mIENhcmJvbj8._30-dig}

Graphite is one of three forms of crystalline, or crystal-forming,
carbon. Carbon also exists in an amorphous, or “shapeless,” form in
substances such as coal and charcoal. Different forms of the same
element are called allotropes. Besides graphite, the other allotropes of
crystalline carbon are diamond and fullerenes. All three forms exist as
crystals rather than molecules. In a crystal, many atoms are bonded
together in a repeating pattern that may contains thousands of atoms.
The arrangement of atoms in the crystal differs for each form of carbon
and explains why the different forms have different properties. For an
entertaining, video-game introduction to the three forms of crystalline
carbon, go to this URL:

**Q:** How do you think the properties of diamond might differ from the
properties of graphite?

**A:** Diamond is clear whereas graphite is black. Diamond is also very
hard, so it doesn’t break easily. Graphite, in contrast, is soft and
breaks very easily.

### Diamond {#4.html#x-ck12-RGlhbW9uZA.._30-17d}

Diamond is a form of carbon in which each carbon atom is covalently
bonded to four other carbon atoms. This forms a strong, rigid,
three-dimensional structure (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FyYm9uRGlhbW9uZA..) ). Diamond is the
hardest natural substance, and no other natural substance can scratch
it. This property makes diamonds useful for cutting and grinding tools
as well as for rings and other jewelry (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlhbW9uZFVzZXM.) ).

### Graphite {#4.html#x-ck12-R3JhcGhpdGU._30-qfr}

Graphite is a form of crystalline carbon in which each carbon atom is
covalently bonded to three other carbon atoms. The carbon atoms are
arranged in layers, with strong bonds within each layer but only weak
bonds between layers (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR3JhcGhpdGU.) ). The weak bonds between
layers allow the layers to slide over one another, so graphite is
relatively soft and slippery. This makes it useful as a lubricant.

**Q:** Why do graphite’s properties make it useful for pencil “leads”?

**A:** Being slippery, graphite slides easily over paper when you write.
Being soft, it rubs off on the paper, allowing you to leave marks.
Graphite’s softness also allows you to sharpen it easily. (Imagine
trying to sharpen a diamond!)

### Fullerene {#4.html#x-ck12-RnVsbGVyZW5l_30-dtx}

A fullerene (also called a Bucky ball) is a form of carbon in which
carbon atoms are arranged in a hollow sphere resembling a soccer ball
(see **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMzMzLUZ1bGxlcmVuZQ..) ).
Each sphere contains 60 carbon atoms, and each carbon atom is bonded to
three others by single covalent bonds. The bonds are relatively weak, so
fullerenes can dissolve and form solutions. Fullerenes were first
discovered in 1985 and have been found in soot and meteorites. Possible
commercial uses of fullerenes are under investigation.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-2cn}

-   Different forms, or allotropes, of carbon are diamond, graphite,
    and fullerenes.
-   In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms,
    forming a rigid structure that makes diamond very hard.
-   In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms,
    and the atoms forms layers that are only weakly bonded together.
    This makes graphite soft and slippery.
-   In a fullerene, carbon atoms are bonded to three other atoms in a
    soccer ball pattern. The bonds are weak, so fullerenes can dissolve
    and form solutions.

Look at all of the pictures above. Each one shows an item that you might
have used or seen used by someone else. All of the items have something
in common. Can you guess what it is? They all involve carbon compounds
known as hydrocarbons.

### What Are Hydrocarbons? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgSHlkcm9jYXJib25zPw.._31-f9j}

**Hydrocarbons** are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen.
Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of carbon-based compounds, but they
can vary greatly in size. The smallest hydrocarbons have just one or two
carbon atoms. The largest hydrocarbons may have thousands of carbon
atoms.

**Q:** How are hydrocarbons involved in each of the photos pictured
above?

**A:** The main ingredient of mothballs is the hydrocarbon naphthalene.
The main ingredient in nail polish remover is the hydrocarbon acetone.
The lawn mower runs on a mixture of hydrocarbons called gasoline, and
the camp stove burns a hydrocarbon fuel named isobutane.

### Properties of Hydrocarbons {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBIeWRyb2NhcmJvbnM._31-1yg}

The size of hydrocarbon molecules influences their properties, including
their melting and boiling points. As a result, some hydrocarbons are
gases at room temperature, while others are liquids or solids.
Hydrocarbons are generally nonpolar, which means that their molecules do
not have oppositely charged sides. Therefore, they do not dissolve in
water, which is a polar compound. In fact, hydrocarbons tend to repel
water. That’s why they are used in floor wax and similar products.

### Classes of Hydrocarbons {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NlcyBvZiBIeWRyb2NhcmJvbnM._31-kym}

Hydrocarbons are placed in two different classes: saturated hydrocarbons
and unsaturated hydrocarbons. This classification is based on the number
of bonds between carbon atoms.

-   Saturated hydrocarbons have only single bonds between carbon atoms,
    so the carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms
    as possible. In other words, they are saturated with hydrogen atoms.
-   Unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one double or triple bond
    between carbon atoms, so the carbon atoms are not bonded to as many
    hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, they are unsaturated
    with hydrogen atoms.

You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons at this

### Uses of Hydrocarbons {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBIeWRyb2NhcmJvbnM._31-cqt}

It is hard to overstate the importance of hydrocarbons to modern life.
Hydrocarbons have even been called the “driving force of western
civilization.” You saw some ways they are used in the opening image.
Several other ways are pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSHlkcm9jYXJib25Vc2Vz) . The most
important use of hydrocarbons is for fuel. Gasoline, natural gas, fuel
oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, coal, kerosene, and propane are just some of
the commonly used hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrocarbons are also used to make
things, including plastics and synthetic fabrics such as polyester.

### Sources of Hydrocarbons {#4.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBIeWRyb2NhcmJvbnM._31-0tw}

The main source of hydrocarbons is fossil fuels—coal, petroleum, and
natural gas. Fossil fuels formed over hundreds of millions of years, as
dead organisms were covered with sediments and put under great pressure.
Giant ferns in ancient swamps turned into coal deposits. The **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtMzM0LUNvYWxNaW5l) shows one way that coal
deposits are mined. Dead organisms in ancient seas gradually formed
deposits of petroleum and natural gas. You can read more about these
sources of hydrocarbons at the URL below.

You can tell that this sponge is saturated with water because when it is
squeezed, the water pours out. When something is saturated with water,
it already holds as much water as possible. Compounds called
hydrocarbons, which contain only carbon and hydrogen, can also be
saturated, but not with water.

### What Are Saturated Hydrocarbons? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgU2F0dXJhdGVkIEh5ZHJvY2FyYm9ucz8._32-xf6}

**Saturated hydrocarbons** are hydrocarbons that contain only single
bonds between carbon atoms. They are the simplest class of hydrocarbons.
They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many
hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are
saturated with hydrogen. You can see an example of a saturated
hydrocarbon in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXRoYW5l) .
In this compound, named ethane, each carbon atom is bonded to three
hydrogen atoms. In the structural formula, each dash (-) represents a
single covalent bond, in which two atoms share one pair of valence
electrons.

**Q:** What is the chemical formula for ethane?

**A:** The chemical formula is C ~2~ H ~6~ .

### What’s in a Name? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgaW4gYSBOYW1lPw.._32-12u}

Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of **alkanes** . The
name of specific alkanes always ends in – *ane* . The first part of the
name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has.
The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next
largest is ethane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and
properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the
**Table** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-UFMtMDMtMDMtMDUtU21hbGxfQWxrYW5lcw..) .
The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the
number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms
generally boil and melt at higher temperatures.

**A:** Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting
points, so some of them are solids at room temperature.

### Shapes of Alkanes {#4.html#x-ck12-U2hhcGVzIG9mIEFsa2FuZXM._32-v5k}

Structural formulas are often used to represent hydrocarbon compounds
because the molecules can have different shapes and a structural formula
shows how the atoms are arranged. Hydrocarbons may form straight chains,
branched chains, or rings (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQWxrYW5lcw..) ). You can read about each
type below.

**Figure 4.59**

A\) In a straight-chain molecule, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a
row like cars of a train. The carbon atoms form the “backbone” of the
molecule. B) In a branched-chain molecule, at least one of the carbon
atoms branches off from the backbone. C) In a cyclic molecule, the chain
of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. Each ring
usually contains just five or six carbon atoms, but rings can join
together to form larger molecules. A cyclic molecule generally has
higher boiling and melting points than straight-chain and branched-chain
molecules.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._32-jso}

-   Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single
    bonds between carbon atoms. As a result, each carbon atom is bonded
    to as many hydrogen atoms as possible.
-   Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. The
    name of specific alkanes always ends in –ane and has a prefix to
    indicate how many carbon atoms it has.
-   Hydrocarbons may form straight chains, branched chains, or rings.
    Ring-shaped hydrocarbons are called cyclic hydrocarbons.

Look at the desks in the photos above. Both pictures show the same
classroom with the same number of desks, but the desks are arranged
differently in each picture. The different arrangements work better for
different classroom activities. Desks in rows facing the front of the
classroom are better for watching the teacher do demonstrations. Desks
facing each other in small groups are better for working on group
projects. What does the arrangement of desks in a classroom have to do
with chemistry? Like desks in a classroom, atoms in a hydrocarbon
molecule can be arranged in different ways, and the different
arrangements give them different properties.

### Same Atoms, Different Shapes {#4.html#x-ck12-U2FtZSBBdG9tcywgRGlmZmVyZW50IFNoYXBlcw.._33-rjd}

Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
The smallest hydrocarbon, methane (CH ~4~ ), contains just one carbon
atom and four hydrogen atoms. Larger hydrocarbons contain many more.
Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms can have different shapes.
Although they have the same chemical formula, with the same numbers of
carbon and hydrogen atoms, they form different compounds, called
**isomers** . Isomers are compounds whose properties are different
because their atoms are bonded together in different arrangements.

### Examples of Isomers {#4.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgSXNvbWVycw.._33-m92}

The smallest hydrocarbon that has isomers is butane, which has just four
carbon atoms. In the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQnV0YW5lSXNvbWVycw..) you can see
structural formulas for normal butane (or *n* -butane) and its only
isomer, named *iso* -butane. Both molecules have four carbon atoms as
well as ten hydrogen atoms (C ~4~ H ~10~ ), but the atoms are arranged
differently in the two compounds. In *n* -butane, all four carbon atoms
are lined up in a straight chain. In *iso* -butane, one of the carbon
atoms branches off from the main chain. You can see three-dimensional
models of these two isomers at the URLs below. Rotate the molecule
models to get a better idea of their shapes.

</div>

The next smallest hydrocarbon is pentane, which has five carbon atoms
and twelve hydrogen atoms (C ~5~ H ~12~ ). Pentane has three isomers:
*n* -pentane, *iso* -pentane, and *neo* -pentane. Their structural
formulas are shown in the images below. Look at the carbon atoms in each
isomer. In *n* -pentane (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtbi1wZW50YW5l) ), the carbon atoms form a
straight chain. In *iso* -pentane (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSXNvcGVudGFuZQ..) ), one carbon atom
branches off from the main chain. In *neo* -pentane (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTmVvcGVudGFuZQ..) ), two carbon atoms
branch off from the main chain.

### How Many Isomers? {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1hbnkgSXNvbWVycz8._33-jqx}

Butane has only two isomers and pentane has just three, but some
hydrocarbons have many more isomers than these. As you increase the
number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon, the number of isomers quickly
increases. For example, heptane, with seven carbon atoms, has nine
isomers; and dodecane, with twelve carbon atoms, has 355 isomers. Some
hydrocarbons with many more carbon atoms have billions of isomers!

**Q:** Why does the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon determine
how many isomers it has?

**A:** The more carbon atoms there are, the greater the number of
possible arrangements of carbon atoms.

### Properties of Isomers {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBJc29tZXJz_33-1gv}

Because isomers are different compounds, they have different properties.
Generally, branched-chain isomers have lower boiling and melting points
than straight-chain isomers. For example, the boiling and melting points
of *iso* -butane are -12 °C and -160 °C, respectively, compared with 0
°C and -138 °C for *n* -butane. The more branching there is, the lower
the boiling and melting points are.

**Q:** The boiling point of *n* -pentane is 36 °C. Predict the boiling
points of *iso* -pentane and *neo* -pentane.

**A:** The boiling point of *iso* -pentane is 28 °C, and the boiling
point of *neo* -pentane is 10 °C.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-slb}

-   Hydrocarbons with the same numbers of atoms but different shapes
    form different compounds called isomers.
-   Hydrocarbons with four or more carbon atoms have isomers. The more
    carbon atoms a hydrocarbon has, the greater the number of isomers.
-   Isomers are different compounds with different properties, such as
    different boiling and melting points.

Look at the difference between cooking oil and butter. Fats can be
either liquid, like oil, or solid, like butter, at room temperature
depending on their chemical structure. Saturated fats are straight in
structure and tightly packed together to form a solid at room
temperature. Double and triple bonds in unsaturated fats make them
easier to break down at lower temperatures.

</div>

### What Are Unsaturated Hydrocarbons? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgVW5zYXR1cmF0ZWQgSHlkcm9jYXJib25zPw.._34-7l5}

Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. The
carbon atoms in hydrocarbons may share single, double, or triple
covalent bonds. **Unsaturated hydrocarbons** contain at least one double
or triple bond between carbon atoms. They are classified on the basis of
their bonds as alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, or alkynes.

**Q:** Why do you suppose hydrocarbons with double or triple bonds are
called unsaturated?

**A:** A carbon atom always forms four covalent bonds. Carbon atoms with
double or triple bonds are unable to bond with as many hydrogen atoms as
they could if they were joined only by single bonds. This makes them
unsaturated with hydrogen atoms.

### Alkenes {#4.html#x-ck12-QWxrZW5lcw.._34-evy}

Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds are
called **alkenes** . The name of a specific alkene always ends in *–ene*
and has a prefix indicating the number of carbon atoms. The structural
formula in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXRoZW5lQmFuYW5hcw..) represents the
smallest alkene, named ethene, which has two carbon atoms and four
hydrogen atoms (C ~2~ H ~4~ ). Ethene is produced by most fruits and
vegetables. It speeds up ripening. The **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXRoZW5lQmFuYW5hcw..) show the effects of
ethene on bananas.

ethene. The bananas on the right were stored without a bag.

</div>

Alkenes can have different shapes. They can form straight chains,
branched chains, or rings. Alkenes with the same atoms but different
shapes are called isomers. Smaller alkenes have relatively high boiling
and melting points, so they are gases at room temperature. Larger
alkenes have lower boiling and melting points, so they are liquids or
waxy solids at room temperature.

### Aromatic Hydrocarbons {#4.html#x-ck12-QXJvbWF0aWMgSHlkcm9jYXJib25z_34-nct}

Unsaturated hydrocarbons called **aromatic hydrocarbons** are cyclic
hydrocarbons that have double bonds. These compounds have six carbon
atoms in a ring with alternating single and double bonds. The smallest
aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene, which has just one ring. Its structural
formula is shown in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmVuemVuZQ..) . Larger aromatic
hydrocarbons consist of two or more rings, which are joined together by
bonds between their carbon atoms. The name of aromatic hydrocarbons
comes from their strong aroma, or scent. That’s why they are used in air
fresheners and mothballs. You can learn more about these interesting
hydrocarbons at this URL:

**A:** Each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds. Carbon atoms always
form four covalent bonds, regardless of the atoms to which it bonds.

### Alkynes {#4.html#x-ck12-QWxreW5lcw.._34-t3g}

Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more triple bonds are
called **alkynes** . The names of specific alkynes always end in *–yne*
and have a prefix for the number of carbon atoms. The structural formula
in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXRoeW5l) represents
the smallest alkyne, named ethyne, which has two carbon atoms and two
hydrogen atoms (C ~2~ H ~2~ ). Ethyne is also called acetylene. It is
burned in acetylene torches, like the one pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmxvd3RvcmNo) . The flame of an acetylene
torch is so hot that it can melt metal.

The opening image is a model of an important chemical compound. Without
it, living things would not have the energy they need to survive.
Compared with most other compounds in living things, molecules of this
compound are small and simple. In the model, the gray circles represent
carbon atoms, the red circles represent oxygen atoms, and the black
circles represent hydrogen atoms.

**Q:** What is the chemical formula for this compound, and what is its
name?

**A:** The chemical formula is C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ , and the name of the
compound is glucose. In this article you’ll learn more about glucose and
other compounds that are essential to life.

### Introduction to Biochemical Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIEJpb2NoZW1pY2FsIENvbXBvdW5kcw.._35-exh}

Glucose is an example of a biochemical compound. The prefix *bio-* comes
from the Greek word that means “life.” A **biochemical compound** is any
carbon-based compound that is found in living things. Biochemical
compounds make up the cells and tissues of living things. They are also
involved in all life processes, including making and using food for
energy. Given their diversity of functions, it’s not surprising that
there are millions of different biochemical compounds.

**Q:** Plants make food in the process of photosynthesis. What
biochemical compound is synthesized in photosynthesis?

**A:** Glucose is synthesized in photosynthesis.

Virtually all living things use glucose for energy, but glucose is just
one of many examples of biochemical compounds that are found in most or
all living things. In fact the similarity in biochemical compounds
between living things provides some of the best evidence for the
evolution of species from common ancestors. A classic example is the
biochemical compound called cytochrome c. It is found in all living
organisms because it performs essential life functions. Only slight
variations in the molecule exist between closely related species, as you
can see in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMy0zLThUZXRyYWh5bWVuYUN5dG9jaHJvbWVD) .
The molecule is identical in humans and their closest relatives, the
chimpanzees. And even between humans and the single-celled tetrahymena
(pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtMy0zLThUZXRyYWh5bWVuYUN5dG9jaHJvbWVD) ),
the cytochrome c molecule is nearly 50 percent the same.

### Structure of Biochemical Molecules {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIEJpb2NoZW1pY2FsIE1vbGVjdWxlcw.._35-j3d}

All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well as carbon.
They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur. Almost all
biochemical compounds are polymers. Polymers are large molecules that
consist of many smaller, repeating molecules, called monomers. Glucose
is a monomer of biochemical compounds called starches. In starches and
all other biochemical polymers, monomers are joined together by covalent
bonds, in which atoms share pairs of valence electrons.

### Size of Biochemical Molecules {#4.html#x-ck12-U2l6ZSBvZiBCaW9jaGVtaWNhbCBNb2xlY3VsZXM._35-if7}

Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules. The prefix *macro-* means
“large,” and many biochemical molecules are very large indeed. They may

**Q:** In which class of biochemical compounds would you place glucose?

**A:** Glucose is a sugar in the class carbohydrates. Like other
carbohydrates, it contains only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It
provides energy to the cells of living things.

**Q:** Look back at the chemical formula for titin. In which class of
biochemical compounds should it be placed?

**A:** Titin is a protein. You can tell because it contains sulfur, and
proteins are the only biochemical compounds that contain this element.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._35-b1i}

-   Biochemical compounds are carbon-based compounds that are found in
    living things. The similarity in biochemical compounds between
    living things provides evidence for the evolution of species from
    common ancestors.
-   All biochemical molecules contain hydrogen and oxygen as well
    as carbon. They may also contain nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and/or sulfur. Almost all biochemical compounds are polymers.
-   Most biochemical molecules are macromolecules, meaning that they are
    very large. Some contain thousands of monomer molecules.
-   Although there are millions of biochemical compounds, all of them
    can be grouped into just four classes: carbohydrates, proteins,
    lipids, and nucleic acids.

The fluffy white fibers on this plant look like cotton balls because
that’s what they are. The plant is a cotton plant, and the fibers are
used to make cotton fabric. Cotton fibers consist of one of the most
common compounds on Earth: cellulose. Cellulose is a biochemical
compound found in all plants. It belongs to the class of biochemical
compounds called carbohydrates.

### What are Carbohydrates? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgQ2FyYm9oeWRyYXRlcz8._36-tge}

**Carbohydrates** are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. The
other three classes are proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In addition
to cellulose, carbohydrates include sugars and starches. Carbohydrate
molecules contain atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Living things
use carbohydrates mainly for energy. For more in-depth information on
carbohydrates, you may want to watch the videos at these URLs:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kphsHC91dU](watch?v=5kphsHC91dU)

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVJbtOPhZdY](watch?v=rVJbtOPhZdY)

**Q:** Which carbohydrates do you use for energy?

**A:** You may eat a wide variety of carbohydrates—from sugars in fruits
to starches in potatoes. However, body cells use only sugars for energy.

### Sugars {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VnYXJz_36-yme}

Sugars are simple carbohydrates. Molecules of sugars have relatively few
carbon atoms. Glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ) is one of the smallest sugar
molecules. Plants and some other organisms make glucose in the process
of photosynthesis. Living things that cannot make glucose obtain it by
consuming plants or these other organisms.

In the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3VnYXJz) , you can see
structural formulas for glucose and two other sugars, named fructose and
sucrose. Fructose is a sugar that is found in fruits. It is an isomer of
glucose. Isomers are compounds that have the same atoms but different
arrangements of atoms. Do you see how the atoms are arranged differently
in fructose than in glucose? You’re probably most familiar with the
sugar sucrose, because sucrose is table sugar. It’s the sugar that you
spoon onto your cereal or into your iced tea.

*Note* : Each unlettered point where lines intersect represents a carbon
atom.

</div>

**Q:** Compare the structure of sucrose with the structures of glucose
and fructose. How is sucrose related to the other two sugars?

**A:** Sucrose consists of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of
fructose bonded together.

### Starches {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RhcmNoZXM._36-vpy}

Starches are complex carbohydrates. They are polymers of glucose. A
polymer is a large molecule that consists of many smaller, repeating
molecules, called monomers. The monomers are joined together by covalent
bonds. Starches contain hundreds of glucose monomers. Plants make
starches to store extra glucose. Consumers get starches by eating
plants. Common sources of starches in the human diet are pictured in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RhcmNoZXM.) . Our digestive
system breaks down starches to sugar, which our cells use for energy.

### Cellulose {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHVsb3Nl_36-g2b}

Cellulose is another complex carbohydrate that is a polymer of glucose.
However, glucose molecules are bonded together differently in cellulose
than they are in starches. Cellulose molecules bundle together to form
long, tough fibers, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2VsbHVsb3Nl) . Have you ever eaten raw
celery? If you have, then you probably noticed that the stalks contain
long, stringy fibers. The fibers are mostly cellulose. Cellulose is the
most abundant biochemical compound. It makes up the cell walls of plants
and gives support to stems and tree trunks. Cellulose also provides
needed fiber in the human diet. We can’t digest cellulose, but it helps
keep food wastes moving through the digestive tract.

These pretty, colorful “ribbons” aren’t leftover ribbons from birthday
gifts. The “ribbons” are a model of a molecule called hemoglobin, which
is coursing through your blood vessels right now. Hemoglobin is a
compound that is found in red blood cells and has the crucial job of
carrying oxygen to cells throughout the body. Your life depends on
hemoglobin.

### Meet the Proteins {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVldCB0aGUgUHJvdGVpbnM._37-lga}

Hemoglobin is a compound in the class of compounds called proteins.
**Proteins** are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are
compounds in living things. (The other three classes are carbohydrates,
lipids, and nucleic acids.) Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, and sulfur. Protein molecules consist of one or more chains of
small molecules called amino acids.

### Protein Structure {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbiBTdHJ1Y3R1cmU._37-bff}

Amino acids are the “building blocks” of proteins. There are 20
different amino acids. The structural formula of the simplest amino
acid, called glycine, is shown in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR2x5Y2luZQ..) . Other amino acids have
slightly different structures. A protein molecule is made from one or
more long chains of amino acids, each linked to its neighbors by
covalent bonds. If a protein has more than one chain, the chains are
held together by weaker bonds, such as hydrogen bonds.

The sequence of amino acids in chains and the number of chains in a
protein determine the protein’s shape. The shape of a protein, in turn,
determines its function. Shapes may be very complex. You can learn more
about the shapes of proteins at the URL below.

**Q:** What do you think the “ribbons” in the colorful hemoglobin
molecule pictured in the opening image represent?

**A:** The “ribbons” represent chains of amino acids.

### Protein Functions {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbiBGdW5jdGlvbnM._37-dep}

Proteins are the most numerous and diverse biochemical compounds, and
they have many different functions. Some of their functions include:

-   making up tissues as components of muscle.
-   speeding up biochemical reactions as enzymes.
-   regulating life processes as hormones.
-   helping to defend against infections as antibodies.
-   carrying materials around the body as transport proteins (see the
    example of hemoglobin in the **Figure**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJhbnNwb3J0UHJvdGVpbg..) ).

You’ve probably seen dozens of nutrition facts labels like the one in
the opening image. The labels show the nutrients that foods contain.
Many people read nutrition facts labels to see how much fat there is in
particular foods. That’s because eating too much fat, especially
saturated fat, can be unhealthy and contribute to weight gain. Fats are
a type of biochemical compound called lipids.

**Lipids** are one of four classes of biochemical compounds, which are
compounds that make up living things and carry out life processes. (The
other three classes of biochemical compounds are carbohydrates,
proteins, and nucleic acids.) Living things use lipids to store energy.
Lipids are also the major components of cell membranes in living things.
Types of lipids include fats and oils.

-   Fats are solid lipids that animals use to store energy.
-   Oils are liquid lipids that plants use to store energy.

**Q:** Can you name some lipids that are fats? What are some lipids that
are oils?

**A:** Lipids that are fats include butter and the fats in meats. Lipids
that are oils include olive oil and vegetable oil. Examples of both
types of lipids are pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT2lsRmF0) .

### Fatty Acids {#4.html#x-ck12-RmF0dHkgQWNpZHM._38-yzk}

Lipids consist only or mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Both fats
and oils are made up of long chains of carbon atoms that are bonded
together. These chains are called fatty acids. Fatty acids may be
saturated or unsaturated. In the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmF0dHlBY2lkcw..) you can see structural
formulas for two small fatty acids, one saturated and one unsaturated.

-   Saturated fatty acids have only single bonds between carbon atoms.
    As a result, the carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms
    as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated
    with hydrogens. Saturated fatty acids are found in fats.
-   Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between
    carbon atoms. As a result, some carbon atoms are not bonded to as
    many hydrogen atoms as possible. They are unsaturated
    with hydrogens. Unsaturated fatty acids are found in oils.

**Figure 4.75**

</div>

**Q:** Both of these fatty acid molecules have six carbon atoms and two
oxygen atoms. How many hydrogen atoms does each fatty acid molecule
contain? What else is different about the two molecules?

**A:** The saturated fatty acid molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms. This is
as many hydrogen atoms as can possibly be bonded to carbon atoms in this
molecule. The unsaturated fatty acid molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms, or
two less than the maximum possible number. The saturated fatty acid has
only single bonds between its carbon atoms. The unsaturated fatty acid
has a double bond between two of its carbon atoms.

### Phospholipids {#4.html#x-ck12-UGhvc3Bob2xpcGlkcw.._38-wv3}

Some lipids contain the element phosphorus as well as carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. These lipids are called phospholipids. Two layers of
phospholipid molecules make up the cell membranes of living things. In
the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGhvc3Bob2xpcGlkcw..) ,
you can see how phospholipid molecules are arranged in a cell membrane.

-   One end of each phospholipid molecule is polar, so it has a partial
    electric charge. Water is also polar and has electrically charged
    ends, so it is attracted to the oppositely charged end of a
    phospholipid molecule. This end of the phospholipid molecule is
    described as hydrophilic, which means “water loving.”
-   The other end of each phospholipid molecule is nonpolar and has no
    electric charge. This end of the phospholipid molecule repels polar
    water and is described as hydrophobic, or “water hating.”

In the **Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGhvc3Bob2xpcGlkcw..) ,
the hydrophilic ends of the phospholipid molecules are on the outsides
of the cell membrane, and the hydrophobic ends are on the inside of the
cell membrane. This arrangement of phospholipids allows some substances
to pass through the cell membrane while keeping other substances out.

Did you ever see a spiral staircase like the one in the opening image?
The steps connect the two sides of the staircase, which winds around a
central axis. A spiral staircase can be used as a model for a DNA
molecule. DNA is a nucleic acid.

**Q:** DNA is such a well-known molecule that you probably know
something about it already. What do you know about DNA, and why do you
think this molecule is so “famous”?

**A:** You many know that DNA contains genes. It is so “famous” because
it explains how we inherit traits from our parents and pass them on to
our offspring.

### What Are Nucleic Acids? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTnVjbGVpYyBBY2lkcz8._39-o3j}

**Nucleic acids** are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. (The
other three classes are carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.) Nucleic
acids include RNA (ribonucleic acid) as well as DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid). Both types of nucleic acids contain the elements carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. 

**Q:** Which of the elements in DNA is not identified with any other
class of biochemical compounds?

**A:** All biochemical compounds contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen;
and proteins as well as nucleic acids contain nitrogen. Phosphorus is
the only element that is identified with nucleic acids.

### Nucleotides {#4.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVvdGlkZXM._39-amv}

Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides,
which are held together by covalent bonds. The structure of a nucleotide
is shown in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTnVjbGVvdGlkZQ..) . Each nucleotide
consists of:

1.  a phosphate group, which contains phosphorus and oxygen (PO ~4~ ).
2.  a sugar, which is deoxyribose (C ~5~ H ~8~ O ~4~ ) in DNA and ribose
    (C ~5~ H ~10~ O ~5~ ) in RNA.
3.  one of four nitrogen-containing bases. (A base is a compound that is
    not neither acidic nor neutral.) In DNA, the bases are adenine,
    thymine, guanine, and cytosine. RNA has the base uracil instead of
    thymine, but the other three bases are the same.

### The Double Helix {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIERvdWJsZSBIZWxpeA.._39-ril}

RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two
chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form hydrogen bonds with
each other. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a
positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively
charged atom in another molecule. Hydrogen bonds form only between
adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. These bonds hold
the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or
spiral, shape.

You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRE5BU3RydWN0dXJl) . Sugars and phosphate
groups form the “backbone” of each chain of DNA. The bonded bases are
called base pairs. Determining the structure of DNA was a huge
scientific breakthrough. You can read the interesting story of its
discovery and why it was so important at the URL below.

### Functions of Nucleic Acids {#4.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIE51Y2xlaWMgQWNpZHM._39-shm}

DNA stores genetic information in the cells of all living things. It
contains the genetic code. This is the code that instructs cells how to
make proteins. The instructions are encoded in the sequence of nitrogen
bases in the nucleotide chains of DNA. RNA copies and interprets the
genetic code in DNA and is also involved in the synthesis of proteins
based on the code. You can watch these events unfolding at the following
URL. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJxobgkPEAo](watch?v=NJxobgkPEAo)

**Q:** DNA is found only in the nucleus of cells, but proteins are
synthesized in the cytoplasm of cells, outside of the nucleus. How do
you think the instructions encoded in DNA reach the cytoplasm so they
can be used to make proteins?

**A:** After RNA copies the instructions in DNA, it carries them from
the nucleus to a site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm, where the
instructions are translated into a protein.

This marathon runner has just finished running a 26.2-mile race! Running
that far nonstop takes a lot of energy—you can tell how drained she is
from her face. But you don’t have to run a marathon to use energy. All
living things need energy all the time just to stay alive. Whether it’s
running a marathon or simply taking a breath, energy is required. Where
does all that energy come from? The answer is chemical reactions.  

### Chemical Reactions in Living Things {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25zIGluIExpdmluZyBUaGluZ3M._40-ckx}

Chemical reactions that take place inside living things are called
**biochemical reactions** ( *bio-* means “life”). It’s not just for
energy that living things depend on biochemical reactions. Every
function and structure of a living organism depends on thousands of
biochemical reactions taking place in each cell. The sum of all these
biochemical reactions is called metabolism.

### Catabolic and Anabolic Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2F0YWJvbGljIGFuZCBBbmFib2xpYyBSZWFjdGlvbnM._40-ylr}

Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general
categories: catabolic reactions and anabolic reactions. You can watch an
animation showing how the two categories of reactions are related at
this URL:
[http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap05/lecture1.htm](lecture1.htm)

-   Catabolic reactions involve breaking bonds. Larger molecules are
    broken down to smaller ones. For example, complex carbohydrates are
    broken down to simple sugars. Catabolic reactions release energy, so
    they are exothermic.
-   Anabolic reactions involve forming bonds. Smaller molecules are
    combined to form larger ones. For example, simple sugars are
    combined to form complex carbohydrates. Anabolic reactions require
    energy, so they are endothermic.

**Q:** Imagine! Each of the trillions of cells in your body is
continuously performing thousands of catabolic and anabolic reactions.
That’s an amazing number of biochemical reactions—far more than the
number of reactions that might take place in a lab or factory. How can
so many biochemical reactions take place simultaneously in our cells?

**A:** So many reactions can occur because biochemical reactions are
amazingly fast.

**Q:** In a lab or factory, reactants can be heated to very high
temperatures or placed under great pressure so they will react very
quickly. These ways of speeding up chemical reactions can’t occur inside
the delicate cells of living things. So how do cells speed up
biochemical reactions?

**A:** The answer is enzymes.

### The Importance of Enzymes {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEltcG9ydGFuY2Ugb2YgRW56eW1lcw.._40-53u}

Enzymes are proteins that increase the rate of chemical reactions by
reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start
reacting. Enzymes are synthesized in the cells that need them, based on
instructions encoded in the cell’s DNA. Enzymes aren’t changed or used
up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the
same reaction over and over again. Enzymes are highly specific for
certain chemical reactions, so they are very effective. A reaction that
would take years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split
second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste
products rarely form.  

### Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration {#4.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXMgYW5kIENlbGx1bGFyIFJlc3BpcmF0aW9u_40-s8e}

Some of the most important biochemical reactions are the reactions
involved in photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Together, these two
processes provide energy to almost all of Earth’s organisms. The two
processes are closely related, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXM.) . In
photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is converted to stored
chemical energy in glucose. In cellular respiration, stored energy is
released from glucose and stored in smaller amounts that cells can use.

**Figure 4.79**

</div>

**Q:** What are the reactants and products in photosynthesis and
cellular respiration?

**A:** In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water (H ~2~ O)
are the reactants. They combine using energy from light to produce
oxygen (O ~2~ ) and glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ). Oxygen and glucose,
in turn, are the reactants in cellular respiration. They combine to
produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._40-0ij}

-   Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside
    living things. Thousands of biochemical reactions continuously take
    place inside each cell. The sum of all these biochemical reactions
    is called metabolism.
-   Biochemical reactions of metabolism can be divided into two general
    categories: catabolic reactions, which break bonds and release
    energy, and anabolic reactions, which form bonds and absorb energy.
-   Enzymes are proteins that greatly increase the rate of biochemical
    reactions, allowing thousands of reactions to occur simultaneously
    in living cells.
-   The chemical reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration
    together provide energy to virtually all living things on Earth.

Look at the amazing meat-eating plants pictured here! Called pitcher
plants, they use their “pitchers” to capture and digest insects. But
even these pitcher plants—like all other plants—make food by
photosynthesis. They “eat” insects just to get extra nutrients.

### Food from Light {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBmcm9tIExpZ2h0_41-ntu}

Most of the energy used by living things comes either directly or
indirectly from the sun. That’s because sunlight provides the energy for
photosynthesis. This is the process in which plants and certain other
organisms synthesize glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ). The process uses
carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen. The overall chemical
equation for photosynthesis is:

**6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Light Energy → C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~**

Photosynthesis changes light energy to chemical energy. The chemical
energy is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules. Glucose, in turn, is
used for energy by the cells of almost all living things. Photosynthetic
organisms such as plants make their own glucose. Other organisms get
glucose by consuming plants (or organisms that consume plants).

**Q:** How do living things get energy from glucose?

**A:** They break bonds in glucose and release the stored energy in the
process of cellular respiration.

### Photosynthetic Organisms {#4.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGV0aWMgT3JnYW5pc21z_41-g4d}

The organisms pictured in the **Figures**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFpbmZvcmVzdA..) ,

[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWxnYWVQb25k) all use sunlight to make
glucose in the process of photosynthesis. In addition to plants, they
include bacteria and algae. All of these organisms contain the green
pigment chlorophyll, which is needed to capture light energy.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._41-zdt}

-   Photosynthesis is the process in which certain living things use
    energy in sunlight to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide
    and water. Oxygen is also produced in this process.
-   Chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules is
    used by the cells of almost all living things for energy.
-   Living things that undergo photosynthesis and produce glucose
    include plants, cyanobacteria, and algae.

“Now, take a deep breath so I can listen to your lungs.” Did your doctor
ever tell you that, while listening to your back or chest with a
stethoscope? Breathing is often referred to as respiration. When you
breathe, you take oxygen into your lungs as you inhale, and you release
carbon dioxide and water vapor as you exhale. Inside all the cells of
your body, a different kind of respiration takes place. This kind of
respiration is called cellular respiration.  

### What is Cellular Respiration? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBDZWxsdWxhciBSZXNwaXJhdGlvbj8._42-lbi}

**Cellular Respiration** is the process in which the cells of living
things break down the organic compound glucose with oxygen to produce
carbon dioxide and water. The overall chemical equation for cellular
respiration is:

**C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ → 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O**

As the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVzcGlyYXRpb24tQ2VsbHVsYXJSZXNwaXJhdGlvbg..)
shows, cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all kinds of
organisms, including those that make their own food (autotrophs) as well
as those that get their food by consuming other organisms
(heterotrophs).

</div>

**Q:** How is cellular respiration related to breathing?

**A:** Breathing consists of inhaling and exhaling, and its purpose is
to move gases into and out of the body. Oxygen needed for cellular
respiration is brought into the body with each inhalation. Carbon
dioxide and water vapor produced by cellular respiration are released
from the body with each exhalation.

### Energy Changes in Cellular Respiration {#4.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IENoYW5nZXMgaW4gQ2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24._42-e95}

The reactions of cellular respiration are catabolic reactions. In
catabolic reactions, bonds are broken in larger molecules and energy is
released. In cellular respiration, bonds are broken in glucose, and this
releases the chemical energy that was stored in the glucose bonds. Some
of this energy is converted to heat. The rest of the energy is used to
form many small molecules of a compound called adenosine triphosphate,
or ATP. ATP molecules contain just the right amount of stored chemical
energy to power biochemical reactions inside cells. You can see these
energy changes in cellular respiration in the video at this URL:

An enzyme cleaner like the one pictured here contains proteins called
enzymes. The enzymes attach themselves to particular stains and help
break them down. Different enzymes work on different types of stains,
such as grease stains or bloodstains. Removing stains isn’t the only use
of enzymes. Enzymes are also essential to life.  

### Why Living Things Need Enzymes {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IExpdmluZyBUaGluZ3MgTmVlZCBFbnp5bWVz_43-sxf}

Chemical reactions constantly occur inside the cells of living things.
However, under the conditions inside cells, most biochemical reactions
would occur too slowly to maintain life. That’s where enzymes come in.
**Enzymes** are catalysts in living things. Like other catalysts, they
speed up chemical reactions. Enzymes are proteins that are synthesized
in the cells that need them, based on instructions encoded in the cells’
DNA.

### How Enzymes Work {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVuenltZXMgV29yaw.._43-rrl}

Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount
of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way
this can happen is modeled in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW56eW1lcw..) . Enzymes aren’t changed or
used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up
the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific
for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective.
A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might
occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very
efficient, so waste products rarely form.

</div>

**Q:** This model of enzyme action is called the lock-and-key model.
Explain why.

**A:** The substrates (reactants) fit precisely into the active site of
the enzyme like a key into a lock. Being brought together in the enzyme
in this way helps the reactants react more easily. After the product is
formed, it is released by the enzyme. The enzyme is now ready to pick up
more reactants and catalyze another reaction. You can see an animated
version of this model at the following URL.

It can be really exciting to explore a big underground cave like the one
in this picture. Do you know how caves form? Believe it or not, water is
the answer. Water slowly dissolves rocks, especially certain types of
rocks such as limestone. When rocks or other substances dissolve in
water, they form a solution.

### What Is a Solution? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFNvbHV0aW9uPw.._44-pwa}

A **solution** is a mixture of two or more substances, but it’s not just
any mixture. A solution is a homogeneous mixture. In a homogeneous
mixture, the dissolved particles are spread evenly through the mixture.
The particles of the solution are also too small to be seen or to settle
out of the mixture. To put solutions in context as a type of mixture,
watch the video at this URL:

### Parts of a Solution {#4.html#x-ck12-UGFydHMgb2YgYSBTb2x1dGlvbg.._44-cfe}

All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is
the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that
dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of
solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt
water, such as the ocean water in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT2NlYW4.) , is an example of a solution.
In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent.

**Q:** A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean
and determined that the sample was about 3.5 percent dissolved salt.
Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the
Pacific Ocean.

**A:** As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore,
no matter where the water sample is obtained, its composition will be
about 3.5 percent dissolved salt.

### Soluble or Insoluble? {#4.html#x-ck12-U29sdWJsZSBvciBJbnNvbHVibGU__44-15p}

Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so
many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the
universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the
cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given
solvent, such as water, is said to be **soluble** in that solvent.
Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to
be **insoluble** in that solvent.

Although most solutes can dissolve in water, some solutes are insoluble
in water. Oil is an example. Did you ever try to mix oil with water? No
matter how well you mix the oil into the water, after the mixture stands
for a while, the oil separates from the water and rises to the top. You
can see how oil floats on ocean water in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT2lsU3BpbGw.) .

### Solutions and States of Matter {#4.html#x-ck12-U29sdXRpb25zIGFuZCBTdGF0ZXMgb2YgTWF0dGVy_44-dqm}

Like salt water in the ocean, many solutions are normally in the liquid
state. However, matter in any state can form a solution. An alloy, which
is a mixture of a metal with one or more other substances, is a solid
solution at room temperature. For example, the alloy bronze is a
solution of copper and tin. Matter in the gaseous state can also form
solutions.

**Q:** What is an example of a gaseous solution?

**A:** Air in the atmosphere is a gaseous solution. It is a mixture that
contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen gases, with very small amounts of
several other gases. The circle graph in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQXRtb3NwaGVyZQ..) shows the composition
of air. Because air is a solution, it is homogeneous. In other words, no
matter where you go, the air always contains the same proportion of
gases that are shown in the graph.

This giant Buddha statue, which is a national treasure in Japan, is made
of bronze. Bronze consists mainly of copper but also contains some tin.
Bronze is an example of a solution. A solution is a type of mixture that
has the same composition throughout.  

### How a Solution Forms {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgU29sdXRpb24gRm9ybXM._45-xga}

A solution forms when one substance is dissolved by another. The
substance that dissolves is called the **solute** . The substance that
dissolves it is called the **solvent** . The solute is present in a
lesser amount that the solvent. When the solute dissolves, it separates
into individual particles, which spread throughout the solvent.

**Q:** In bronze, what are the solute and solvent?

**A:** Because bronze consists mainly of copper, copper is the solvent
and tin is the solute. The two metals are combined in a hot, molten
state, but they form a solid solution at room temperature.

### What’s Your State? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgWW91ciBTdGF0ZT8._45-51n}

In the example of bronze, a solid (tin) is dissolved in another solid
(copper). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a
solution. For example, in a saltwater solution, a solid (salt) is
dissolved in a liquid (water). The **Table**

  *Liquid dissolved in liquid* : vinegar         acetic acid      water

### Water as a Solvent {#4.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgYXMgYSBTb2x2ZW50_45-g53}

Salt isn’t the only solute that dissolves in water. In fact, so many
things dissolve in water that water is sometimes called the universal
solvent. Water is such a good solvent because it is a very polar
compound. A polar compound has positively and negatively charged ends.
Solutes that are also charged are attracted to the oppositely charged
ends of water molecules. This allows the water molecules to pull the
solute particles apart.

On the other hand, there are some substances that don’t dissolve in
water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush with water after painting
with an oil-based paint? It doesn’t work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar,
so its particles aren’t charged. As a result, oil-based paint doesn’t
dissolve in water. (You can see how to dissolve oil-based paint in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGFpbnRUaGlubmVy) .)

These examples illustrate a general rule about solutes and solvents:
like dissolves like. In other words, polar solvents dissolve polar
solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes. You can see a
student’s video demonstrating solutes that do and solutes that don’t
dissolve in water at this URL:

### Ionic and Covalent Solutes {#4.html#x-ck12-SW9uaWMgYW5kIENvdmFsZW50IFNvbHV0ZXM._45-nes}

All solutes separate into individual particles when they dissolve, but
the particles are different for ionic and covalent compounds. Ionic
solutes separate into individual ions. Covalent solutes separate into
individual molecules.

Salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is an ionic compound. When it dissolves
in water, it separates into positive sodium ions (Na ^+^ ) and negative
chloride ions (Cl ^-^ ). You can see how this happens in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlzc29sdmluZ1NhbHQ.) . The negative
oxygen ends of water molecules attract the positive sodium ions, and the
positive hydrogen ends of water molecules attract the negative chloride
ions. These forces of attraction pull the ions apart. You can watch this
happening in animations at these URLs:

The sugar glucose is a covalent compound. When sugar dissolves in water,
it forms individual glucose molecules (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ). You can see
how this happens in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlzc29sdmluZ1N1Z2Fy) . Sugar is polar
like water, so sugar molecules also have positive and negative ends.
Forces of attraction between oppositely charged ends of water and sugar
molecules pull individual sugar molecules away from the sugar crystal.
Little by little, the sugar molecules are separated from the crystal and
surrounded by water. You can watch this happening in the video at the
following URL:

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._45-px0}

-   A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The
    substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that
    dissolves it is called the solvent.
-   Solutes and solvents may be any state of matter.
-   Many solutes dissolve in water because water is a very
    polar compound.
-   A general rule: like dissolves like. For example, polar solvents
    dissolve polar solutes, and nonpolar solvents dissolve
    nonpolar solutes.
-   Ionic solutes separate into individual ions when they dissolve.
    Covalent solutes separate into individual molecules.

If you’re like Tanya in this picture, you prefer your iced tea sweetened
with sugar. Sweetened iced tea is a solution in which solid sugar (the
solute) is dissolved in cold liquid tea, which is mostly water (the
solvent). When you add sugar to tea, particles of water pull apart
particles of sugar. The particles of sugar spread throughout the tea,
making all of it taste sweet.

### Factors That Affect the Rate of Dissolving {#4.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEFmZmVjdCB0aGUgUmF0ZSBvZiBEaXNzb2x2aW5n_46-nf4}

Did you ever get impatient and start drinking a sweetened drink before
all the sugar has dissolved? As you drink the last few drops, you notice
that some of the sugar is sitting on the bottom of the container.

**Q:** What could you do to dissolve the sugar faster?

**A:** The rate of dissolving is influenced by several factors,
including stirring, temperature of solvent, and size of solute
particles. You can see videos demonstrating these factors at the
following URLs:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF55VAk1Nlk](watch?v=cF55VAk1Nlk)

### Stirring {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RpcnJpbmc._46-kr0}

Stirring a solute into a solvent speeds up the rate of dissolving
because it helps distribute the solute particles throughout the solvent.
For example, when you add sugar to iced tea and then stir the tea, the
sugar will dissolve faster. If you don’t stir the iced tea, the sugar
may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer.

### Temperature {#4.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmU._46-xub}

The temperature of the solvent is another factor that affects how fast a
solute dissolves. Generally, a solute dissolves faster in a warmer
solvent than it does in a cooler solvent because particles have more
energy of movement. For example, if you add the same amount of sugar to
a cup of hot tea and a cup of iced tea, the sugar will dissolve faster
in the hot tea.

### Particle Size {#4.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljbGUgU2l6ZQ.._46-5vl}

A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the size of solute
particles. For a given amount of solute, smaller particles have greater
surface area. With greater surface area, there can be more contact
between particles of solute and solvent. For example, if you put
granulated sugar in a glass of iced tea, it will dissolve more quickly
than the same amount of sugar in a cube (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3VnYXI.) ). That’s because all those
tiny particles of granulated sugar have greater total surface area than
a single sugar cube.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._46-xbz}

-   The rate of dissolving of a solute in a solvent is faster when the
    solute and solvent are stirred, the solvent is warmer, or the solute
    consists of smaller particles with more surface area.

Why hasn’t the ocean water in this photo turned to ice? The water in the
glacier on shore is frozen solid, but the water in the ocean is still in
a liquid state.

**Q:** What is it about ocean water that keeps it from freezing when the
temperature falls below the freezing point of pure water?

**A:** Ocean water is salty.

### How Solutes Affect Solvents {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNvbHV0ZXMgQWZmZWN0IFNvbHZlbnRz_47-d7g}

Salt water in the ocean is a solution. In a solution, one substance,
called the solute, dissolves in another substance, called the solvent.
In ocean water, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. When a
solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the
solvent. In particular, the solute generally lowers the freezing point
of the solvent, which is called freezing point depression, and raises
the boiling point of the solvent, which is called boiling point
elevation. For example, adding either salt to water lowers the freezing
point and raises the boiling point of the water. To learn the why these
effects occur, watch the excellent video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9LxdqYntlU](watch?v=z9LxdqYntlU) .

### Freezing Point Depression {#4.html#x-ck12-RnJlZXppbmcgUG9pbnQgRGVwcmVzc2lvbg.._47-b6v}

Pure water freezes at 0 °C, but the salt water in the ocean freezes at
-2.2 °C because of freezing point depression. We take advantage of the
freezing point depression of salt in water by putting salt on ice to
melt it. That’s why the truck in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJ1Y2s.) is spreading salt on an icy
road.

Did you ever see anyone add a fluid to their car radiator? The fluid
might be antifreeze, like in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQW50aWZyZWV6ZQ..) . Antifreeze lowers the
temperature of the water in the car radiator so it won’t freeze, even
when the temperature falls far below 0 °C. For example, a 50 percent
antifreeze solution won’t freeze unless the temperature goes below -37
°C.

**Figure 4.94**

</div>

### Boiling Point Elevation {#4.html#x-ck12-Qm9pbGluZyBQb2ludCBFbGV2YXRpb24._47-whp}

Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the
boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with
a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the
radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the
water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously
damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling
point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a
boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it
won’t boil and ruin the engine.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._47-0yp}

-   When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical
    properties of the solvent.
-   A solute generally lowers the freezing point of a solvent, which is
    called freezing point depression. For example, spreading salt on an
    icy road melts the ice.
-   A solute generally raises the boiling point of a solvent, which is
    called boiling point elevation. For example, adding antifreeze to
    the water in a car radiator prevents the water from boiling.

Rhonda wanted to see if salt or sugar dissolves faster in water. She
added the same amount of salt and sugar to a half liter of room
temperature (20 °C) water in separate glasses. Then she stirred both
mixtures. All of the sugar dissolved in less than a minute, but after 5
minutes of stirring, some of the salt still hadn’t dissolved. Even if
she had kept stirring the saltwater mixture all day, the remaining salt
would not dissolve. Do you know why? The answer is their solubility.

### What Is Solubility? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBTb2x1YmlsaXR5Pw.._48-ayu}

**Solubility** is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given
amount of solvent at a given temperature. In a solution, the solute is
the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that does
the dissolving. For a given solvent, some solutes have greater
solubility than others. For example, sugar is much more soluble in water
than is salt. But even sugar has an upper limit on how much can
dissolve. In a half liter of 20 °C water, the maximum amount is 1000
grams. If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar won’t dissolve.
You can compare the solubility of sugar, salt, and some other solutes in
the **Table** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-U29sdWJpbGl0eVNvbHV0ZXNpbldhdGVy) .
For a video about solubility, go to this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKimraU21ws](watch?v=IKimraU21ws) .  

  **Solute**    **Grams of Solute that Will Dissolve in 0.5 L of Water (20 °C)**
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Baking Soda   48
  Epsom salt    125
  Table salt    180
  Table sugar   1000

**Q:** How much salt do you think Rhonda added to the half-liter of
water in her experiment?

**A:** The solubility of salt is 180 grams per half liter of water at 20
°C. If Rhonda had added less than 180 grams of salt to the half-liter of
water, then all of it would have dissolved. Because some of the salt did
not dissolve, she must have added more than 180 grams of salt to the
water.

### Factors That Affect Solubility {#4.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEFmZmVjdCBTb2x1YmlsaXR5_48-qku}

Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is
one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state
of the solute, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU29sdWJpbGl0eUN1cnZl) . You can learn

</div>

-   If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature
    increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in
    hot water than in cold water.
-   If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases
    its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in
    warm water than in cold water.

The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the
force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas
increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how
it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide.
Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is
less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of
solution and rushes into the air.

**Q:** Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm
soda or a can of cold soda?

**A:** A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the
temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore, less carbon
dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._48-lyx}

-   Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given
    amount of solvent at a given temperature. Some solutes have greater
    solubility than others.
-   Temperature affects the solubility of solutes in all three states.
    Pressure also affects the solubility of gases.

You could add all the sugar in this scoop to the water in the measuring
container, and all the sugar would dissolve, forming a sugar-water
solution. A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which the
substances are mixed evenly throughout. The substance that dissolves in
a solution is the solute. In this case the solute is sugar. The
substance that does the dissolving—in this case, the water—is the
solvent. Sugar is one of the most soluble solutes in water. This means
that more of it can dissolve in water than is true of many other
solutes. However, there is a limit on how much of any solute—even
sugar—will dissolve in water or other given solvent.

### Saturated vs. Unsaturated Solutions {#4.html#x-ck12-U2F0dXJhdGVkIHZzLiBVbnNhdHVyYXRlZCBTb2x1dGlvbnM._49-twt}

The maximum amount of sugar that will dissolve in a liter of 20 °C water
is 2000 grams. A sugar-water solution that contains 1 liter of water and
2000 grams of sugar is said to be saturated. A **saturated solution** is
a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given
solvent at a given temperature. If you add more than 2000 grams of sugar
to a liter of 20 °C water, the extra sugar won’t dissolve. On the other
hand, a solution containing less than 2000 g of sugar in 1 liter of 20
°C water can hold more sugar. A solution that contains less solute than
can dissolve at a given temperature is called an **unsaturated
solution** . You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated
solutions by watching the video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKimraU21ws](watch?v=IKimraU21ws) .

### Saturation Depends on the Solute {#4.html#x-ck12-U2F0dXJhdGlvbiBEZXBlbmRzIG9uIHRoZSBTb2x1dGU._49-0rt}

The **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU29sdWJpbGl0eUJhckdyYXBo)
shows the amounts of several different solutes that will dissolve in a
liter of water at 20 °C. As you can see from the graph, solutes vary
greatly in how soluble they are in water. For example, you can dissolve
almost 20 times as much sugar as baking soda in the same amount of water
at this temperature.

**Q:** Assume that a solution contains 150 grams of Epsom salt in 1
liter of water at 20 °C. Is the solution saturated or unsaturated?

**A:** A saturated solution of Epsom salt in 1 liter of 20 °C water
would contain 250 grams of Epsom salt. Therefore, this solution is
unsaturated. It can hold another 100 grams of Epsom salt.

**Q:** What do you think would happen if you added more than 250 grams
of Epsom salt to a liter of 20 °C water?

**A:** Any Epsom salt over 250 grams would not dissolve in the solution.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._49-hck}

-   A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as
    can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature. An
    unsaturated solution is a solution that contains less solute than
    can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature.
-   Solutes differ in their solubility in a given solvent. Therefore, a
    saturated solution of one solute might contain more or less solute
    than a saturated solution of a different solute.

Dante was shopping for juice and saw a bottle of juice concentrate. He
read the label and learned that some of the water had been removed from
the juice before it was bottled, so the concentrate had to be mixed with
water before drinking. Next to the bottle of juice was a can of juice.
The canned juice was ready to drink. Juice concentrate is an example of
a concentrated solution. Ready-to-drink juice is an example of a dilute
solution.  

### Concentrated and Dilute Solutions {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29uY2VudHJhdGVkIGFuZCBEaWx1dGUgU29sdXRpb25z_50-zcp}

A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which dissolved
particles are distributed evenly throughout the solution. The substance
that dissolves in a solution is called the solute, and the substance
that does the dissolving is called the solvent. The **concentration** of
a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A
solution with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration and is
called a concentrated solution. A solution with little dissolved solute
has a low concentration and is called a dilute solution.

### Calculating the Concentration of a Solution {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgdGhlIENvbmNlbnRyYXRpb24gb2YgYSBTb2x1dGlvbg.._50-oux}

The concentration of a solution represents the percentage of the
solution that is the solute. You can calculate the concentration of a
solution using this formula:

<dl id="x-ck12-xsb">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-gcu">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-lbc">
<dd>
![\\mathrm{Concentration= \\frac{Mass \\; (or \\; volume) \\; of \\;

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
For example, if a 100-gram solution of salt water contains 3 grams of
salt, then its concentration is:

<dl id="x-ck12-wlr">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ixk">

**Q:** A 1000 mL container of brand A juice drink contains 250 mL of
juice and 750 mL of water. A 600 mL container of brand B juice drink
contains 200 mL of juice and 400 mL of water. Which brand of juice drink
is more concentrated, brand A or brand B?

**A:** ![\\mathrm{Concentration(A)= \\frac{250\\; mL}{1000\\; mL}
\\times
100\\%}=25\\%](ck12_math_images_dir/383460438bc2ada57ab4f2ef8145ecee.png)

![\\mathrm{Concentration(B)= \\frac{200\\; mL}{600\\; mL} \\times
100\\%}=33\\%](ck12_math_images_dir/e3c8a206386f21588d77705cb41c21c8.png)

You can conclude that brand B is more concentrated.

Look at the boy in the photo above. You can tell by the expression on
his face that lemon juice tastes sour. Lemon juice is an acid, and all
acids taste sour. They share certain other properties as well. You will
learn more about acids and their properties in this article. For a
musical introduction to acids and related concepts, watch the video at
this URL:

### What Are Acids? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQWNpZHM__51-3k1}

**Acids** are ionic compounds that produce positive hydrogen ions (H ^+^
) when dissolved in water. Ionic compounds are compounds that contain
positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic
bonds. (Ions are atoms that have become charged particles by gaining or
losing electrons.) An example of an acid is hydrogen chloride (HCl).
When it dissolves in water, it separates into positive hydrogen ions and
negative chloride ions (Cl ^-^ ). This is represented by the chemical
equation:

### Properties of Acids {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBBY2lkcw.._51-l1b}

You already know that a sour taste is one property of acids. ( *Warning*
: **Never** taste an unknown substance to see whether it is an acid!)
Acids have certain other properties as well. For example, acids can
conduct electricity when dissolved in water because they consist of
charged particles in solution. (Electric current is a flow of charged
particles.) Acids can also react with metals, and when they do they
produce hydrogen gas. An example of this type of reaction is
hydrochloric acid reacting with the metal zinc (Zn). The reaction is
pictured in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWNpZFppbmM.)
. It can be represented by the chemical equation:

### Detecting Acids {#4.html#x-ck12-RGV0ZWN0aW5nIEFjaWRz_51-ovq}

Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when acids come into
contact with them, so indicators can be used to detect acids. An example
of an indicator is the compound called litmus. It is placed on small
strips of paper that may be red or blue. If you place a few drops of
acid on a strip of blue litmus paper, the paper will turn red. You can
see this in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGl0bXVzLUFjaWQ.) . Litmus isn’t the only
indicator for detecting acids. Red cabbage juice also works well, as you
can see in this entertaining video:

### Strength of Acids {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RyZW5ndGggb2YgQWNpZHM._51-wzv}

The strength of acids is measured on a scale called the pH scale. The pH
value of a solution represents its concentration of hydrogen ions. A pH
value of 7 indicates a neutral solution, and a pH value less than 7
indicates an acidic solution. The lower the pH value is, the greater is
the concentration of hydrogen ions and the stronger the acid. The
strongest acids, such as battery acid, have pH values close to zero.

### Uses of Acids {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBBY2lkcw.._51-lyq}

Acids have many important uses, especially in industry. For example,
sulfuric acid is used to manufacture a variety of different products,
including paper, paint, and detergent. Some other uses of acids are be
seen in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWNpZA..) .

These blocks of baking chocolate may make your mouth water, but if you
were to taste them, you would be in for an unpleasant surprise. The
blocks are unsweetened chocolate. Without any added sugar, chocolate
tastes bitter. Chocolate tastes bitter because it’s a base.

### What Are Bases? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgQmFzZXM__52-5ka}

Bases are ionic compounds that produce negative hydroxide ions (OH ^-^ )
when dissolved in water. An ionic compound contains positive metal ions
and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic bonds. (Ions are atoms
that have become charged particles because they have either lost or
gained electrons.) An example of a base is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When
it dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide ions and positive
sodium ions (Na ^+^ ). This can be represented by the equation:

### Properties of Bases {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBCYXNlcw.._52-jds}

All bases share certain properties, including a bitter taste. (
*Warning:* Never taste an unknown substance to see whether it is a
base!) Bases also feel slippery. Think about how slippery soap feels.
That’s because it’s a base. In addition, bases conduct electricity when
dissolved in water because they consist of charged particles in
solution. (Electric current is a flow of charged particles.)

**Q:** Bases are closely related to compounds called acids. How are
their properties similar? How are they different?

**A:** A property that is shared by bases and acids is the ability to
conduct electricity when dissolved in water. Some ways bases and acids
are different is that acids taste sour whereas bases taste bitter. Also,
acids but not bases react with metals. For other differences between

### Detecting Bases {#4.html#x-ck12-RGV0ZWN0aW5nIEJhc2Vz_52-3on}

Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when bases come into
contact with them, so they can be used to detect bases. An example of an
indicator is a compound called litmus. It is placed on small strips of
paper that may be red or blue. If you place a few drops of a base on a
strip of red litmus paper, the paper will turn blue. You can see this in
the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGl0bXVzLUJhc2U.) . Litmus
isn’t the only detector of bases. Red cabbage juice can also detect
bases, as you can see in this video:

### Strength of Bases {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RyZW5ndGggb2YgQmFzZXM._52-jhq}

The strength of bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which
ranges from 0 to 14. On this scale, a pH value of 7 indicates a neutral
solution, and a pH value greater than 7 indicates a basic solution. The
higher the pH value is, the stronger the base. The strongest bases, such
as drain cleaner, have a pH value close to 14.

### Uses of Bases {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBCYXNlcw.._52-lrt}

Bases are used for a variety of purposes. For example, soaps contain
bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH). Other uses of bases can be seen
in the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfQmFzZXM.) .

This scientist is collecting and testing samples of water from the
river. One of the properties of the water she is testing is acidity. She
wants to know how acidic the water is because water that is too acidic
can harm the health of water organisms.

### Strength of Acids and Bases {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RyZW5ndGggb2YgQWNpZHMgYW5kIEJhc2Vz_53-zak}

Acids are ionic compounds that produce positively charged hydrogen ions
(H ^+^ ) when dissolved in water. Acids taste sour and react with
metals. Bases are ionic compounds that produce negatively charged
hydroxide ions (OH ^-^ ) when dissolved in water. Bases taste bitter and
do not react with metals. Examples of acids are vinegar and battery
acid. The acid in vinegar is weak enough to safely eat on a salad. The
acid in a car battery is strong enough to eat through skin. Examples of
bases include those in antacid tablets and drain cleaner. Bases in
antacid tablets are weak enough to take for an upset stomach. Bases in
drain cleaner are strong enough to cause serious burns.

**Q:** What do you think causes these differences in the strength of
acids and bases?

**A:** The strength of an acid or a base depends on how much of it
breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.

### Concentration of Ions {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29uY2VudHJhdGlvbiBvZiBJb25z_53-ucf}

The strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces
when it dissolves in water. A stronger acid produces more hydrogen ions
than a weaker acid. For example, sulfuric acid (H ~2~ SO ~4~ ), which is
found in car batteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks
down into ions when it dissolves in water. On the other hand, acetic
acid (CH ~3~ CO ~2~ H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid
because less than 1 percent of it breaks down into ions in water.

The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces
when it dissolves in water. A stronger base produces more hydroxide ions
than a weaker base. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in
drain cleaner, is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions
when it dissolves in water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO ~3~ ), a base in
antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks
down into ions in water.

### The pH Scale {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIHBIIFNjYWxl_53-3fb}

The strength of acids and bases is measured on a scale called the pH
scale, which is shown in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtcEhTY2FsZQ..) . By definition, **pH**
represents the **acidity** , or hydrogen ion (H ^+^ ) concentration, of
a solution. Pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7. With a higher
the concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic and has a
lower pH. Acids have a pH less than 7, and the strongest acids have a pH
close to zero. Bases have a pH greater than 7, and the strongest bases
have a pH close to 14. It’s important to realize that the pH scale is
based on powers of ten. For example, a solution with a pH of 8 is 10
times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7, and a solution with a
pH of 9 is 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7.

**Q:** How much more acidic is a solution with a pH of 4 than a solution
with a pH of 7?

**A:** A solution with a pH of 4 is 1000 (10 × 10 × 10, or 10 ^3^ )
times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 7.

**Q:** Which solution on the pH scale in the **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtcEhTY2FsZQ..) is the weakest acid? Which
solution is the strongest base?

**A:** The weakest acid on the scale is milk, which has a pH value
between 6.5 and 6.8. The strongest base on the scale is liquid drain
cleaner, which has a pH of 14.

### Why pH Matters {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IHBIIE1hdHRlcnM._53-6kd}

Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many
plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. Fish may also
need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when
dissolved in water droplets in the air. This results in acid fog and
acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower. The pH chart in the
**Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtcEhTY2FsZQ..) and the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGVhZEZvcmVzdA..) reveal some
of the adverse effects of acid fog and rain. Acid rain not only kills
trees. It also lowers the pH of surface waters such as ponds and lakes.
As a result, the water may become too acidic for fish and other water
organisms to survive.

</div>

Even normal (clean) rain is somewhat acidic. That’s because carbon
dioxide (CO ~2~ ) in the air dissolves in raindrops, producing a weak
acid called carbonic acid (H ~2~ CO ~3~ ), which has a pH of about 5.5.
When rainwater soaks into the ground, it can slowly dissolve rocks,
particularly those containing calcium carbonate. This is how water forms
underground caves.

**Q:** How do you think acid rain might affect buildings and statues
made of stone?

**A:** Acid rain dissolves and damages stone buildings and statues. The
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RhdHVl) shows a statue that
has been damaged by acid rain.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._53-yfa}

-   The strength of an acid or base is called acidity. It depends on how
    much of the substance breaks down into ions when it dissolves
    in water.
-   Acidity is measured by pH, which is the concentration of hydrogen
    ions in a solution.
-   Acidity is an important factor for living things because most can
    survive only within a relatively narrow range of acidity.

What is one of the most important characteristics of a referee? A
referee must be neutral. He can’t favor one team over the other. In
chemistry, being neutral means not being an acid or a base. Pure water
is an example of a neutral substance. In some chemical reactions, an
acid and a base combine to form neutral products, including water.
You’ll see how this happens when you read this article.  

### Acids, Bases, and Ions {#4.html#x-ck12-QWNpZHMsIEJhc2VzLCBhbmQgSW9ucw.._54-lzp}

An acid is a compound that produces positive hydrogen ions (H ^+^ ) and
negative nonmetal ions when it dissolves in water. (Ions are atoms that
have become charged by losing or gaining electrons.) Hydrochloric acid
(HCl) is an example of an acid. When it dissolves in water, it produces
positive hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl ^-^ ). This can be
represented by the chemical equation:

A base is a compound that produces negative hydroxide ions (OH ^-^ ) and
positive metal ions when it dissolves in water. For example, when the
base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it produces negative
hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na ^+^ ). This can be
represented by the chemical equation:

**Q:** If you were to combine acid and base solutions, what products do
you think would be produced?

**A:** Combining acid and base solutions produces water and a neutral
ionic compound.

### Reactions of Acids and Bases {#4.html#x-ck12-UmVhY3Rpb25zIG9mIEFjaWRzIGFuZCBCYXNlcw.._54-7a5}

When an acid and a base react, the reaction is called a **neutralization
reaction** . That’s because the reaction produces neutral products.
Water is always one product, and a salt is also produced. A **salt** is
a neutral ionic compound. You can learn more about salts and how they
form at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjIVJh4JLNo](watch?v=zjIVJh4JLNo) .

Let’s see how a neutralization reaction produces both water and a salt,
using as an example the reaction between solutions of hydrochloric acid
and sodium hydroxide. The overall equation for this reaction is:

<dl id="x-ck12-NWE3ODU3NDc1YzkyNWM5NjNiNjk0YThiY2VkNmQ2NjA.-prr">

<dl id="x-ck12-NWE3ODU3NDc1YzkyNWM5NjNiNjk0YThiY2VkNmQ2NjA.-kzr">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NWE3ODU3NDc1YzkyNWM5NjNiNjk0YThiY2VkNmQ2NjA.-tgv">
<dd>
NaOH + HCl → H ~2~ O and NaCl

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Now let’s break this reaction down into two parts to see how each
product forms.

-   Positive hydrogen ions from HCl and negative hydroxide ions from
    NaOH combine to form water. This part of the reaction can be
    represented by the equation:

<dd>
H ^+^ + OH ^-^ → H ~2~ O

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
-   Positive sodium ions from NaOH and negative chloride ions from HCL
    combine to form the salt sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly called
    table salt. This part of the reaction can be represented by the
    equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-YjRkYWMxNmFkNDEzZTVjYTExMTU3ODA2NzA4YzFiZTU.-yt5">

The man in this old illustration was an alchemist. Alchemists, who lived
during the Middle Ages, were people who strived to turn lead into gold.
They tried all sorts of chemical reactions involving lead, but they were
never able to produce gold. Today, scientists know that one element
cannot be changed into another by chemical processes. However, there is
a way that some elements can change into others. You’ll find out what it
is when you read this article.  

### Elements and Protons {#4.html#x-ck12-RWxlbWVudHMgYW5kIFByb3RvbnM._55-tuh}

For an atom of one element to change into a different element, the
number of protons in its nucleus must change. That’s because each
element has a unique number of protons. For example, lead atoms always
have 82 protons, and gold atoms always have 79 protons.

**Q:** So how can one element change into another?

**A:** The starting element must be radioactive, and its nuclei must
gain or lose protons.

### Radioactive Elements {#4.html#x-ck12-UmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRWxlbWVudHM._55-dkg}

**Radioactivity** is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off,
charged particles and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and
energy are called by the general term **radiation** . Only unstable
nuclei emit radiation. They are unstable because they have too much
energy, too many protons, or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons.
For example, all elements with more than 83 protons—such as uranium,
radium, and polonium—have unstable nuclei. They are called radioactive
elements. The nuclei of these elements must lose protons to become more
stable. When they do, they become different elements.

### How Radioactivity Was Discovered {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IFJhZGlvYWN0aXZpdHkgV2FzIERpc2NvdmVyZWQ._55-cud}

Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine
Henri Becquerel, who is pictured
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmVjcXVlcmVs) . Becquerel was
experimenting with uranium, which was known to glow after being exposed
to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of
energy, like rays of light or X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a
photographic plate after exposing the uranium to sunlight. The plate was
similar to the film that is used today to take X-rays, and Becquerel
expected the uranium to leave an image on the plate. The next day, there
was an image on the plate, just as Becquerel expected. This meant that
uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight.

Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to
confirm his results. He placed more uranium on another photographic
plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and
uranium in a drawer to try again another day. He wasn’t expecting the
uranium to leave an image on the plate without first being exposed to
sunlight. To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer
the next day. Becquerel had discovered that uranium gives off rays of
energy on its own. He had discovered radioactivity, for which he
received a Nobel prize. To learn more about the importance of
Becquerel’s research, go to this URL:

Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the
term *radioactivity* . The other scientist was the French chemist Marie
Curie. She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and
radium. She won two Nobel Prizes for her discoveries. You can learn more

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._55-fu7}

-   Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit charged particles
    and energy from its nucleus. The charged particles and energy are
    called by the general term radiation.
-   Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by Antoine Henri Becquerel when
    he found that uranium leaves an image like an X-ray on a
    photographic plate. Besides uranium, radioactive elements include
    radium and polonium, both of which were discovered by Marie Curie.

This fossil skull came from an ancient human ancestor. Scientists used
carbon-14 dating to estimate its age. Carbon-14 is one of several
radioisotopes that scientists use to estimate the ages of fossils and
other ancient materials.

### What Are Radioisotopes? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgUmFkaW9pc290b3Blcz8._56-yuo}

All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in
their nucleus, but they may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of
the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.
Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. These
isotopes are called **radioisotopes** . Their nuclei are unstable, so
they break down, or decay, and emit radiation.

**Q:** What makes the nucleus of a radioisotope unstable?

**A:** The nucleus may be unstable because it has too many protons or an
unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For a nucleus with a small number
of protons to be stable, the ratio of protons to neutrons should be 1:1.
For a nucleus with a large number of protons to be stable, the ratio
should be about 1:1.5.

### An Example: Carbon-14 {#4.html#x-ck12-QW4gRXhhbXBsZTogQ2FyYm9uLTE0_56-5wz}

Find carbon in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFkaW9hY3RpdmVQZXJpb2RpY1RhYmxl) , and
you’ll see that its atomic number is 6. This means that all carbon atoms
have 6 protons per nucleus. Almost all carbon atoms also have 6 neutrons
per nucleus. These carbon atoms are called carbon-12, where 12 is the
number of protons (6) plus neutrons (6). This gives carbon-12 nuclei a
1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons, so carbon-12 nuclei are stable.

Some carbon atoms have more than 6 neutrons, either 7 or 8. Carbon atoms
with 8 neutrons are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons). The
nuclei of carbon-14 atoms are unstable because they have too many
neutrons relative to protons, so they gradually decay.

**Q:** What is the proton-to-neutron ratio of carbon-14 nuclei?

**A:** With six protons and 8 neutrons, the ratio is 6:8, or 1:1.3.

Q: How is carbon-14 used to estimate the ages of fossils? A: Living
things take in carbon, including tiny amounts of carbon-14, throughout
life. The carbon-14 constantly decays, but more carbon-14 is taken in
all the time to replace it. After living things die, no new carbon-14 is
taken in, and the carbon-14 they already have keeps decaying. The older
a fossil is, the less carbon-14 it still has, so the remaining amount
can be measured to estimate the fossil’s age. You can learn more about
carbon-14 dating at this URL:

### Radioactive Elements {#4.html#x-ck12-UmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRWxlbWVudHM._56-8zz}

In elements with more than 83 protons, all of the isotopes are
radioactive. In the **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFkaW9hY3RpdmVQZXJpb2RpY1RhYmxl) , these
are the elements with a yellow background. The force of repulsion among
all those protons makes the nuclei unstable. Elements with more than 92
protons have such unstable nuclei that they don’t even exist in nature.
They have only been created in labs.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._56-n8t}

-   Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. These
    isotopes are called radioisotopes. An example of a radioisotope
    is carbon-14.
-   The nuclei of radioisotopes are unstable, so they constantly decay
    and emit radiation.
-   In elements with more than 83 protons, all of the isotopes
    are radioactive.

You may have seen this sign before—maybe in a hospital. The sign means
there is danger of radiation in the area. **Radiation** consists of
particles and energy that are given off by radioactive isotopes, which
have unstable nuclei. But you don’t have to go to a hospital to be
exposed to radiation. There is radiation in the world all around you.

### Radiation in the Environment {#4.html#x-ck12-UmFkaWF0aW9uIGluIHRoZSBFbnZpcm9ubWVudA.._57-fgy}

A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This is
called background radiation. One source of background radiation is
rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as
uranium. Another source is cosmic rays. These are charged particles that
arrive on Earth from outer space. Background radiation is generally
considered to be safe for living things. You can learn more about
background radiation with the animation at this URL:
[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/dirtybomb/sources.html](sources.html)

### Dangers of Radiation {#4.html#x-ck12-RGFuZ2VycyBvZiBSYWRpYXRpb24._57-ggu}

Long-term or high-dose exposure to radiation can harm both living and
nonliving things. Radiation knocks electrons out of atoms and changes
them to ions. It also breaks bonds in DNA and other compounds in living
things. One source of radiation that is especially dangerous to people
is radon. Radon is a radioactive gas that forms in rocks underground. It
can seep into basements and get trapped inside buildings. Then it may
build up and become harmful to people who breathe it. Long-term exposure
to radon can cause lung cancer.

Exposure to higher levels of radiation can be very dangerous, even if
the exposure is short-term. A single large dose of radiation can burn
the skin and cause radiation sickness. Symptoms of this illness include
extreme fatigue, destruction of blood cells, and loss of hair. To learn
more about the harmful health effects of radiation, go to this URL:
[http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7359819n](?id=7359819n) .

Click on the image above for more content

Nonliving things can also be damaged by radiation. For example, high
levels of radiation can weaken metals by removing electrons. This is a
problem in nuclear power plants and space vehicles because they are
exposed to very high levels of radiation.

**Q:** Can you tell when you are being exposed to radiation? For
example, can you sense radon in the air?

**A:** Radiation can’t be detected with the senses. This adds to its
danger. However, there are other ways to detect it.

### Detecting Radiation {#4.html#x-ck12-RGV0ZWN0aW5nIFJhZGlhdGlvbg.._57-zct}

You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation.
Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect
radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR2VpZ2VyQ291bnRlcg..) , contains atoms of
a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the
gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current
causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the
higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger
counter and how it was invented at the URL below.

### Using Radiation {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgUmFkaWF0aW9u_57-3b6}

Despite its dangers, radioactivity has several uses. For example, it can
be used to determine the ages of ancient rocks and fossils. It can also
be used as a source of power to generate electricity. Radioactivity can
even be used to diagnose and treat diseases, including cancer. Cancer
cells grow rapidly and take up a lot of glucose for energy. Glucose
containing radioactive elements can be given to patients. Cancer cells
take up more of the glucose than normal cells do and give off radiation.
The radiation can be detected with special machines like the one in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2Nhbm5lcg..) . The radiation
may also kill cancer cells. You can learn more about medical uses of
radiation at this URL:

This diagram could almost illustrate a pinball game. It actually
illustrates the process of radioactive decay. This is a process that
occurs all around you. It may even occur inside your body.

**Q:** Based on the diagram, what happens during radioactive decay?

**A:** The nucleus of a radioactive atom gives off radiation in the form
of energy and a particle of matter.

### Introducing Radioactive Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgUmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRGVjYXk._58-hwp}

**Radioactive decay** is the process in which the nuclei of radioactive
atoms emit charged particles and energy, which are called by the general
term *radiation* . Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei, and when the
nuclei emit radiation, they become more stable. Radioactive decay is a
nuclear—rather than chemical—reaction because it involves only the
nuclei of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, one element may change into
another. For a fun introduction to radioactive decay, watch the short
video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-9yt7OAYmE](watch?v=o-9yt7OAYmE)

### Types of Radioactive Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRGVjYXk._58-edc}

There are several types of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and
gamma decay. In all three types, nuclei emit radiation, but the nature
of the radiation differs. The **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXNSYWRpb2FjdGl2ZURlY2F5) shows the radiation
emitted in each type of decay. You can watch a video about the three
types at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koOwozY4oc](watch?v=3koOwozY4oc) .

  **Type**      **Radiation Emitted**
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  Alpha decay   alpha particle (2 protons and 2 neutrons) + energy
  Beta decay    beta particle (1 electron or 1 positron) + energy
  Gamma decay   energy (gamma ray)

### It’s Elemental {#4.html#x-ck12-SXTigJlzIEVsZW1lbnRhbA.._58-qbo}

Both alpha and beta decay change the number of protons in an atom’s
nucleus, thereby changing the atom to a different element. In alpha
decay, the nucleus loses two protons. In beta decay, the nucleus either
loses a proton or gains a proton. In gamma decay, no change in proton
number occurs, so the atom does not become a different element.

**Q:** If the radioactive element polonium (Po) undergoes alpha decay,
what element does it become?

**A:** From the periodic table, the atomic number of polonium is 84, so
it has 84 protons. If it loses two protons through alpha decay, it will
have 82 protons. Atoms with 82 protons are the element lead (Pb).

### Dangers of Radioactive Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-RGFuZ2VycyBvZiBSYWRpb2FjdGl2ZSBEZWNheQ.._58-cs6}

The charged particles and energy emitted during radioactive decay can
harm living things, but the three types of radioactive decay aren’t
equally dangerous. That’s because they differ in how far they can travel
and what they can penetrate. You can see this in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFkaWF0aW9uV2F2ZXM.) and in the

cells deep inside the body.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._58-vsp}

-   Radioactive decay is the process in which unstable nuclei of
    radioactive atoms become stable by emitting charged particles
    and energy.
-   There are three types of radioactive decay: alpha decay, beta decay,
    and gamma decay. Alpha and beta decay change one element
    into another. Gamma decay does not.
-   Radioactive decay can damage living things. Alpha decay is the least
    damaging, and gamma decay is the most damaging.

You probably associate the term *decay* with images like the one above.
But when it comes to atoms, decay has a different meaning. Decay in
chemistry refers to changes in the nuclei of certain atoms.

### Why Some Nuclei Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFNvbWUgTnVjbGVpIERlY2F5_59-ihi}

Radioactive elements and isotopes have unstable nuclei. To become more
stable, the nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In radioactive decay, the
nuclei give off, or emit, radiation in the form of energy and often
particles as well. There are several types of radioactive decay,
including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is emitted in all three
types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also emit particles.  

### What Is Alpha Decay? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBBbHBoYSBEZWNheT8._59-d26}

Alpha decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many
protons. The **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWxwaGFEZWNheQ..)
shows what happens during alpha decay. The nucleus emits an alpha
particle and energy. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two
neutrons, which is actually a helium nucleus. Losing the protons and
neutrons makes the nucleus more stable.

### Equations for Alpha Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-RXF1YXRpb25zIGZvciBBbHBoYSBEZWNheQ.._59-gbx}

Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols that
indicate their numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, an alpha
particle (helium nucleus) is represented by the symbol ![\\mathrm{\^4\_2
He}](ck12_math_images_dir/655c092eeee15133039030b8b13b6157.png) , where
He is the chemical symbol for helium, the subscript 2 is the number of
protons, and the superscript 4 is the mass number (2 protons + 2
neutrons).

Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive
decay. Let’s consider an example. Uranium-238 undergoes alpha decay to
become thorium-234. (The numbers following the chemical names refer to
the number of protons plus neutrons.) In this reaction, uranium-238
loses two protons and two neutrons to become the element thorium-234.
The reaction can be represented by this nuclear equation:

</dl>
If you count the number of protons (subscripts) as well as the number of
protons plus neutrons (superscripts), you’ll see that the total numbers
are the same on both sides of the arrow. This means that the equation is
balanced. The thorium-234 produced in this reaction is also unstable, so
it will undergo radioactive decay as well. The alpha particle (
![\\mathrm{\^4\_2
He}](ck12_math_images_dir/655c092eeee15133039030b8b13b6157.png) )
produced in the reaction can join with two free electrons to form the
element helium. This is how most of Earth’s helium formed.

</dl>
**A:** The subscript of Pb is 82, and the superscript is 206. This means
that the new element produced in the reaction has 82 protons. You can
find the element with this number of protons in the periodic table. It
is the element lead (Pb). The new element also has 124 neutrons (206 –
82 protons = 124 neutrons).

### How Dangerous Is Alpha Decay? {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IERhbmdlcm91cyBJcyBBbHBoYSBEZWNheT8._59-uwz}

All types of radioactive decay pose risks to living things, but alpha
decay is the least dangerous. That’s because alpha particles are
relatively heavy, so they can travel only a few centimeters through the
air. They also are not very penetrating. For example, they can’t pass
through a sheet of paper or thin layer of clothing. They may burn the
skin, but they can’t penetrate to the tissues underneath the skin.
However, if alpha particles are emitted inside the body, they can do
more damage. One way this can happen is by inhaling cigarette smoke.
People who smoke actually inhale the radioactive element polonium-210.
It undergoes alpha decay in the lungs. Over time, exposure to alpha
particles may cause lung cancer.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._59-ywf}

-   Alpha decay is one of three types of nuclear decay in which unstable
    nuclei emit energy with or without a particle of matter.
-   In alpha decay, energy and an alpha particle are emitted by a
    nucleus that is unstable because it has too many protons. An alpha
    particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, so it is actually
    a helium nucleus.
-   Alpha decay is represented by a nuclear equation. The equation is
    balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same
    on both sides of the arrow.
-   All radioactive decay is dangerous to living things, but alpha decay
    is the least dangerous.

If you hear the word *decay* while your dentist is checking your teeth,
it’s probably bad news. But if you’re an unstable atomic nucleus, decay
is good news. When the nucleus of an atom decays, it becomes more
stable.

### Which Nuclei Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hpY2ggTnVjbGVpIERlY2F5_60-2w5}

Atoms with unstable nuclei are radioactive. To become more stable, the
nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In radioactive decay, the nuclei emit
energy and usually particles of matter as well. There are several types
of radioactive decay, including alpha, beta, and gamma decay. Energy is
emitted in all three types of decay, but only alpha and beta decay also
emit particles.  

### What Is Beta Decay? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBCZXRhIERlY2F5Pw.._60-ors}

Beta decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits a beta particle and
energy. A beta particle is either an electron or a positron. An electron
is a negatively charged particle, and a positron is a positively charged
electron (or anti-electron). When the beta particle is an electron, the
decay is called beta-minus decay. When the beta particle is a positron,
the decay is called beta-plus decay. Beta-minus decay occurs when a
nucleus has too many neutrons relative to protons, and beta-plus decay
occurs when a nucleus has too few neutrons relative to protons.

**Q:** Nuclei contain only protons and neutrons, so how can a nucleus
emit an electron in beta-minus decay or a positron in beta-plus decay?

**A:** Beta decay begins with a proton or neutron. You can see how in
the **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmV0YURlY2F5) .

<div id="4.html#x-ck12-YTFjOWE1ZGUzMWZkZTFmMzI0YTRkZDFhNjEwMTgwM2Q.-b46"

**Figure 4.112**

</div>

**Q:** How does beta decay change an atom to a different element?

**A:** In beta-minus decay an atom gains a proton, and it beta-plus
decay it loses a proton. In each case, the atom becomes a different
element because it has a different number of protons.

### Equations for Beta Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-RXF1YXRpb25zIGZvciBCZXRhIERlY2F5_60-rqq}

Radioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols..
For example, a beta-minus particle (electron) is represented by the
symbol ![\\mathrm{\^0\_{-1}
e}](ck12_math_images_dir/15316c7435bced5cb454740d1b251b4a.png) . The
subscript -1 represents the particle’s charge, and the superscript 0
shows that the particle has virtually no mass (no protons or neutrons).
Another example is the radioactive nucleus of thorium-234. It is
represented by the symbol ![\\mathrm{\^{234}\_{90}
Th}](ck12_math_images_dir/00c47e8c4a552e6b05291f7435f18dab.png) , where
the subscript 90 stands for the number of protons and the superscript
234 for the number of protons plus neutrons.

Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive
decay. Let’s consider the example of the beta-minus decay of thorium-234
to protactinium-234. This reaction is represented by the equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-NmIzNDc1NThmMzA2OWEyYmMwOTMwZGNjZmZhYmYyZTc.-8gs">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NmIzNDc1NThmMzA2OWEyYmMwOTMwZGNjZmZhYmYyZTc.-bg9">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NmIzNDc1NThmMzA2OWEyYmMwOTMwZGNjZmZhYmYyZTc.-cds">
<dd>
![\\mathrm{\^{234}\_{90}

![\\mathrm{\^{234}\_{91}

![\\mathrm{\^0\_{-1}

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
The equation shows that thorium-234 becomes protactinium-234 and loses a
beta particle and energy. The protactinium-234 produced in the reaction
is also radioactive, so it will decay as well.

A nuclear equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and
neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow. If you compare the
subscripts and superscripts on both sides of the equation above, you’ll
see that they are the same.

**Q:** What happens to the electron produced in the reaction above?

**A:** Along with another electron, it can combine with an alpha
particle to form a helium atom. An alpha particle, which is emitted
during alpha decay, consists of two protons and two neutrons.

**Q:** Try to balance the following nuclear equation for beta-minus
decay by filling in the missing subscript and superscript.

### Dangers of Beta Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-RGFuZ2VycyBvZiBCZXRhIERlY2F5_60-4pd}

Beta particles can travel about a meter through air. They can pass
through a sheet of paper or a layer of cloth but not through a sheet of
aluminum or a few centimeters of wood. They can also penetrate the skin
and damage underlying tissues. They are even more harmful if they are
ingested or inhaled.  

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._60-y30}

-   Beta decay occurs when a nucleus is unstable because it has too many
    or too few neutrons relative to protons. The nucleus emits a beta
    particle and energy. A beta particle is either an electron
    (beta-minus decay) or a positron (beta-plus decay).
-   In beta-minus decay, a neutron breaks down to a proton and an
    electron, and the electron is emitted from the nucleus. In beta-plus
    decay, a proton breaks down to a neutron and a positron, and the
    positron is emitted from the nucleus.
-   Balanced nuclear equations show how the numbers of protons and
    neutrons change in beta decay.
-   Beta radiation is harmful to living things.

This stunning image is an artist’s rendition of a gamma ray burst. A
gamma ray burst is a sudden, intense flash of gamma rays given off by an
extremely energetic explosion. The bursts have been observed in distant
galaxies. But gamma rays also occur on Earth.

### What Are Gamma Rays? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgR2FtbWEgUmF5cz8._61-p9o}

**Gamma rays** are electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are
waves of electric and magnetic energy that travel through space at the
speed of light. The energy travels in tiny “packets” of energy, called
photons. Photons of gamma energy are called gamma particles. Other
electromagnetic waves include microwaves, light rays, and X rays. Gamma
rays have the greatest amount of energy of all electromagnetic waves.

### Gamma Rays and Radioactive Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-R2FtbWEgUmF5cyBhbmQgUmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRGVjYXk._61-9ld}

Gamma rays are produced when radioactive elements decay. Radioactive
elements are elements with unstable nuclei. To become more stable, the
nuclei undergo radioactive decay. In this process, the nuclei give off
energy and may also emit charged particles of matter. Types of
radioactive decay include alpha, beta, and gamma decay. In alpha and
beta decay, both particles and energy are emitted. In **gamma decay** ,
only energy, in the form of gamma rays, is emitted.

Alpha and beta decay occur when a nucleus has too many protons or an
unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. When the nucleus emits a
particle, it gains or loses one or two protons, so the atom becomes a
different element. Gamma decay, in contrast, occurs when a nucleus is in
an excited state and has too much energy to be stable. This often
happens after alpha or beta decay has occurred. Because only energy is
emitted during gamma decay, the number of protons remains the same.
Therefore, an atom does not become a different element during this type
of decay.

**Q:** The **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR2FtbWE.) shows how
helium-3 (He-3) decays by emitting a gamma particle. How can you tell
that the atom is still the same element after gamma decay occurs?

**A:** The nucleus of the atom has two protons (red) before the reaction
occurs. After the nucleus emits the gamma particle, it still has two
protons, so the atom is still the same element.

### Dangers of Gamma Radiation {#4.html#x-ck12-RGFuZ2VycyBvZiBHYW1tYSBSYWRpYXRpb24._61-a0o}

Gamma rays are the most dangerous type of radiation. They can travel
farther and penetrate materials more deeply than can the charged
particles emitted during alpha and beta decay. Gamma rays can be stopped
only by several centimeters of lead or several meters of concrete. It’s
no surprise that they can penetrate and damage cells deep inside the
body. You can learn more about the effects of gamma radiation on people
at this URL:

.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._61-xfx}

-   Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves that carry photons of energy
    called gamma particles. They are the most energetic of all
    electromagnetic waves.
-   Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay of an excited nucleus.
    During gamma decay, the nucleus emits a “packet” of energy called a

Assume that you cut a sheet of paper down the center to get two halves.
Then you cut each half down the center to get four pieces. If you keep
cutting the pieces of paper in half, you would soon a reach a point
where the pieces are too small to cut again. A radioactive isotope is a
little like that sheet of paper.

### What Is a Radioactive Isotope? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFJhZGlvYWN0aXZlIElzb3RvcGU__62-fkz}

A radioactive isotope, or radioisotope, has atoms with unstable nuclei.
The unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down, by losing energy and
particles of matter to become more stable. If they gain or lose protons
as they decay, they become different elements. Over time, as the nuclei
continue to decay, less and less of the original radioisotope remains.  

### Rate of Radioactive Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-UmF0ZSBvZiBSYWRpb2FjdGl2ZSBEZWNheQ.._62-pit}

A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a constant
rate. The rate is measured in a unit called the **half-life** . This is
the length of time it takes for half of a given amount of the
radioisotope to decay. This rate is always the same for a given
radioisotope, regardless of temperature, pressure, or other conditions
outside the nuclei of its atoms.

**Q:** How is repeatedly cutting paper in half like the decay of a
radioisotope?

**A:** As a radioisotope decays, the amount of the radioisotope
decreases by half during each half-life, just as a piece of paper
decreases in size by half each time you cut it down the center. You can
see a video of this half-life analogy at the following URL.

### Half-Life Example {#4.html#x-ck12-SGFsZi1MaWZlIEV4YW1wbGU._62-3yz}

The concept of half-life is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmF0ZW9mRGVjYXk.) for the decay of
phosphorus-32 to sulfur-32. The half-life of phosphorus-32 is 14 days.
After 14 days, half of the original amount of phosphorus-32 has decayed,
so only half remains. After another 14 days, half of the remaining
amount (or a quarter of the original amount) is still left, and so on.

</div>

**Q:** What fraction of the original amount of phosphorus-32 remains
after three half-lives?

**A:** After three half-lives, or 42 days, 1/8 (1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2) of the
original amount of phosphorus-32 remains.

### Variation in Half-Lives {#4.html#x-ck12-VmFyaWF0aW9uIGluIEhhbGYtTGl2ZXM._62-eh9}

Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay. That’s
because they vary in how unstable their nuclei are. The more unstable
the nuclei, the faster they break down. As you can see from the examples
in the **Table** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-SGFsZl9saWZl) , the half-life of
a radioisotope can be as short as a split second or as long as several
billion years. You can simulate radioactive decay of radioisotopes with
different half-lives at the URL below.
[http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive\_decay3.html](radioactive_decay3.html)

  **Isotope**    **Half-life**
  -------------- --------------------
  Uranium-238    4.47 billion years
  Potassium-40   1.28 billion years
  Carbon-14      5,700 years
  Hydrogen-3     12.3 years
  Radon-222      3.82 days
  Polonium-214   0.00016 seconds

**Q:** If you had 1 gram of carbon-14, how many years would it take for
radioactive decay to reduce it to 1/4 gram?

**A:** 1 gram would decay to ¼ gram in 2 half-lives. One half-life is
5,700 years, so two half-lives are 11,400 years.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._62-07v}

-   A radioisotope decays and changes to a different element at a
    certain constant rate called the half-life. This is the length of
    time it takes for half of a given amount of the radioisotope
    to decay.
-   Different radioisotopes may vary greatly in their rate of decay. The
    more unstable their nuclei are, the faster they decay.

The Grand Canyon, pictured above, was carved by the rushing waters of
the Colorado River over millions of years. The exposed rocks at the
bottom of the canyon are almost 2 billion years old. The youngest rocks
near the top are about 230 million years old. Therefore, from top to
bottom, the rocks provide a continuous record of more than 1.5 billion
years of geological history in this region.

**Q:** How have scientists been able to determine the ages of rocks in
the Grand Canyon?

**A:** The ages are based on the gradual decay, or break down, of
radioactive isotopes.

### What Is Radioactive Dating? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBSYWRpb2FjdGl2ZSBEYXRpbmc__63-upd}

Radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes, can be used to estimate the ages
of not only of rocks, but also of fossils and artifacts made long ago by
human beings. Even the age of Earth has been estimated on the basis of
radioisotopes. The general method is called **radioactive dating** . To
understand how radioactive dating works, you need to understand
radioisotopes and radioactive decay.

### Radioisotopes and Radioactive Decay {#4.html#x-ck12-UmFkaW9pc290b3BlcyBhbmQgUmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRGVjYXk._63-od2}

A radioisotope has atoms with unstable nuclei. Unstable nuclei naturally
decay, or break down. They lose energy and particles and become more
stable. As nuclei decay, they gain or lose protons, so the atoms become
different elements. This is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWxwaGE.) . The original, unstable
nucleus is called the parent nucleus. After it loses a particle (in this
case a type of particle called an alpha particle), it forms a daughter
nucleus, with a different number of protons.

<div id="4.html#x-ck12-YTFjOWE1ZGUzMWZkZTFmMzI0YTRkZDFhNjEwMTgwM2Q.-pqs"

**Figure 4.115**

</div>

The nucleus of a given radioisotope decays at a constant rate that is
unaffected by temperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the
nucleus. This rate of decay is called the half-life. The half-life is
the length of time it takes for half of the original amount of the
radioisotope to decay to another element.

**Q:** How can the half-life of a radioisotope be used to date a rock?

**A:** After a rock forms, nuclei of a radioisotope inside the rock
start to decay. As they decay, the amount of the original, or parent,
isotope decreases, while the amount of its stable decay product, or
daughter isotope, increases. By measuring the relative amounts of parent
and daughter isotopes and knowing the rate of decay, scientists can
determine how long the parent isotope has been decaying. This provides
an estimate of the rock’s age.

### Different Isotopes, Different Half-Lives {#4.html#x-ck12-RGlmZmVyZW50IElzb3RvcGVzLCBEaWZmZXJlbnQgSGFsZi1MaXZlcw.._63-mfi}

Different radioisotopes decay at different rates. You can see some
examples in the **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZXhhbXBsZV92YXJpYWJsZQ..) . Radioisotopes
with longer half-lives are used to date older rocks or other specimens,
and those with shorter half-lives are used to date younger ones. For
example, the oldest rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon were dated
by measuring the amounts of potassium-40 in the rocks. Carbon-14 dating,
in contrast, is used to date specimens that are much younger than the
rocks in the Grand Canyon. You can read more carbon-14 dating below.

  **Parent Isotope**   **Daughter Isotope**   **Half-Life**
  -------------------- ---------------------- -------------------
  potassium-40         argon-40               1.3 billion years
  uranium-235          lead-207               700 million years
  uranium-234          thorium-230            80,000 years
  carbon-14            nitrogen-14            5,700 years

### Focus on Carbon-14 Dating {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9jdXMgb24gQ2FyYm9uLTE0IERhdGluZw.._63-t1y}

One of the most familiar types of radioactive dating is carbon-14
dating. Carbon-14 forms naturally in Earth’s atmosphere when cosmic rays
strike atoms of nitrogen-14. Living things take in and use carbon-14,
just as they do carbon-12. The carbon-14 in living things gradually
decays to nitrogen-14. However, as it decays, it is constantly replaced
because living things keep taking in carbon-14. As a result, there is a
constant ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in organisms as long as they
are alive. This is illustrated in the top part of the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FyYm9uTGlmZQ..) .

After organisms die, the carbon-14 they already contain continues to
decay, but it is no longer replaced (see the bottom part of the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FyYm9uTGlmZQ..) ).
Therefore, the carbon-14 in a dead organism constantly declines at a
fixed rate equal to the half-life of carbon-14. Half of the remaining
carbon-14 decays every 5,700 years. If you measure how much carbon-14 is
left in a fossil, you can determine how many half-lives (and how many
years) have passed since the organism died. Carbon-14 dating is
illustrated in the video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udkQwW6aLik](watch?v=udkQwW6aLik) .

</div>

**Q:** Why can’t carbon-14 dating be used to date specimens older than
about 60,000 years?

**A:** Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5700 years. After about 60,000
years, too little carbon-14 is left in a specimen to be measured.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._63-hcq}

-   The age of a rock or other specimen can be estimated from the
    remaining amount of a radioisotope it contains and the
    radioisotope’s known rate of decay, or half-life. This method of
    dating specimens is called radioactive dating.
-   Radioisotopes with longer half-lives are used to date older
    specimens, and those with shorter half-lives are used to date
    younger ones.
-   Carbon-14 dating is used to date specimens younger than about 60,000
    years old. It is commonly used to date fossils of living things and
    human artifacts.

Steam rises from the cooling towers of this nuclear power plant. The
steam is only harmless water vapor. Unlike a power plant that burns
fossil fuel, a nuclear power plant doesn’t release pollution into the
air. That’s because a nuclear power plant produces power by nuclear
fission, a type of nuclear reaction.  

### What Is Nuclear Fission? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBOdWNsZWFyIEZpc3Npb24__64-ail}

**Nuclear fission** is the splitting of the nucleus of a radioactive
atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great
deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. Fission of a tiny
pellet of radioactive uranium-235, like the one pictured in the
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVXJhbml1bQ..) , releases as
much energy as burning 1,000 kilograms of coal!

### How Nuclear Fission Occurs {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IE51Y2xlYXIgRmlzc2lvbiBPY2N1cnM._64-rak}

The **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTnVjbGVhckZpc3Npb24.)
shows how nuclear fission of uranium-235 occurs. It begins when a
uranium nucleus gains a neutron. This can happen naturally when a free
neutron strikes it, or it can occur deliberately when a neutron is
crashed into it in a nuclear power plant. In either case, the nucleus of
uranium-235 becomes extremely unstable with the extra neutron. As a
result, it splits into two smaller nuclei, krypton-92 and barium-141.
The reaction also releases three neutrons and a great deal of energy. It
can be represented by this nuclear equation:

.

### Nuclear Chain Reaction {#4.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVhciBDaGFpbiBSZWFjdGlvbg.._64-mzq}

The neutrons released when uranium-235 fissions may crash into other
uranium nuclei and cause them to fission as well. This can start a
nuclear chain reaction. You can see how this happens in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM181XzEwX2NoYWluX3JlYWN0aW9u) . In a
chain reaction, one fission reaction leads to others, which lead to
others, and so on. A nuclear chain reaction is similar to a pile of wood
burning. If you start one piece of wood burning, enough heat is produced
by the burning wood to start the rest of the pile burning without any
further help from you. You can see another example of a chain reaction

### Using Energy from Nuclear Fission {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRW5lcmd5IGZyb20gTnVjbGVhciBGaXNzaW9u_64-mam}

If a nuclear chain reaction is uncontrolled, it produces a lot of energy
all at once. This is what happens in an atomic bomb. However, if a
nuclear chain reaction is controlled, it produces energy much more
slowly. This is what occurs in a nuclear power plant. The reaction is
controlled by inserting rods of nonfissioning material into the
fissioning material. You can see this in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM181XzEwX3Bvd2VycGxhbnQ.) . The radiation
from the controlled fission is used to heat water and turn it to steam.
The steam is under pressure and causes a turbine to spin. The spinning
turbine runs a generator, which produces electricity.

### Pros and Cons of Nuclear Energy {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvcyBhbmQgQ29ucyBvZiBOdWNsZWFyIEVuZXJneQ.._64-z3w}

In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or
other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of
living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes
to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources,
so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main
advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or
cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of
fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are
nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.

The main concern over the use of nuclear energy is the risk of
radiation. Accidents at nuclear power plants can release harmful
radiation that endangers people and other living things. Even without
accidents, the used fuel that is left after nuclear fission reactions is
still radioactive and very dangerous. It takes thousands of years for it
to decay until it no longer releases harmful radiation. Therefore, used
fuel must be stored securely to protect people and other living things.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._64-guy}

-   Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two
    smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great deal of
    energy from a very small amount of matter. It begins when the
    nucleus of a radioactive atom gains a neutron.
-   In uncontrolled nuclear fission, one fission reaction starts a chain
    reaction, in which neutrons produced in one reaction cause other
    reactions, which cause more reactions, and so on.
-   Energy released by nuclear fission is used to produce electrical
    energy in nuclear power plants. Production of nuclear energy doesn’t
    produce air pollution but it poses the risk of accidents that
    release harmful radiation.

What causes the sun to glow so brightly? The answer is nuclear fusion.
Nuclear fusion is a type of nuclear reaction, and it releases a huge
amount of energy.

### What Is Nuclear Fusion? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBOdWNsZWFyIEZ1c2lvbj8._65-udp}

In **nuclear fusion** , two or more small nuclei combine to form a
single, larger nucleus. You can see an example in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM181XzExX251Y2xlYXJfZnVzaW9u) . In this
example, nuclei of two hydrogen isotopes (tritium and deuterium) fuse to
form a helium nucleus. A neutron and a tremendous amount of energy are
also released.

### The Power of Stars {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBvd2VyIG9mIFN0YXJz_65-8jg}

Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun
and other stars. It takes place only at extremely high temperatures.
That’s because a great deal of energy is needed to overcome the force of
repulsion between the positively charged nuclei. The sun’s energy comes
from fusion in its core, shown in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM181XzExX3N1bnN0cnVjdHVyZQ..) . In the
core, temperatures reach millions of degrees Kelvin. The video at the
following URL relates nuclear fusion to energy and high temperatures in
the sun.

**Q** : Why doesn’t nuclear fusion occur naturally on Earth?

**A** : Nuclear fusion doesn’t occur naturally on Earth because it
requires temperatures far higher than Earth temperatures.

### Using Nuclear Fusion {#4.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgTnVjbGVhciBGdXNpb24._65-kn2}

Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion
reactions on Earth. Their goal is develop nuclear fusion power plants,
where the energy from fusion of hydrogen nuclei can be converted to
electricity. You can see how this might work in the **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfM181XzExX2Z1c2lvbl9yZWFjdGlvbnM.) . In
the thermonuclear reactor, radiation from fusion is used to heat water
and produce steam. The steam can then be used to turn a turbine and
generate electricity.

The use of nuclear fusion for energy has several pros. Unlike nuclear
fission, which involves dangerous radioactive elements, nuclear fusion
involves just hydrogen and helium. These elements are harmless. Hydrogen
is also very plentiful. There is a huge amount of hydrogen in ocean
water. The hydrogen in just a gallon of water could produce as much
energy by nuclear fusion as burning 1,140 liters (300 gallons) of
gasoline! The hydrogen in the oceans would generate enough energy to
supply all the world’s people for a very long time.

Unfortunately, using energy from nuclear fusion is far from a reality.
Scientists are a long way from developing the necessary technology. One
problem is raising temperatures high enough for fusion to take place.
Another problem is that matter this hot exists only in the plasma state.
There are no known materials that can contain plasma, although a magnet
might be able to do it. That’s because plasma consists of ions and
responds to magnetism. You can learn more about research on nuclear
fusion at the URL below.

It’s so simple that a baby can understand it! Well, not really, but
Einstein’s famous equation is pretty simple: E = mc ^2^ . Do you know
what it means and why it’s so famous?

### Einstein’s Equation {#4.html#x-ck12-RWluc3RlaW7igJlzIEVxdWF0aW9u_66-q7m}

Einstein’s equation is possibly the best-known equation of all time.

There's reason for that. The equation is incredibly important. It
changed how scientists view energy and matter, which are two of the most
basic concepts in all of science. The equation shows that energy and
matter are two forms of the same thing. This new idea turned science
upside down when Einstein introduced it in the early 1900s. Amazingly,
the idea has withstood the test of time as more and more evidence has
been gathered to support it. You can listen to a recording of Einstein
explaining his famous equation at this URL:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7Sg41Bp-U](watch?v=CC7Sg41Bp-U)

**Q** : What do the letters in Einstein’s equation stand for?

**A** : E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and c stands for the
speed of light.

The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so
c ^2^ is a very big number. Therefore, the amount of energy in even a
small mass of matter is tremendous. Suppose, for example, that you have
1 gram of matter. That’s about the mass of a paperclip. Multiplying this
mass by c ^2^ would yield enough energy to power 3,600 homes for a year!

### Mass and Energy in Nuclear Reactions {#4.html#x-ck12-TWFzcyBhbmQgRW5lcmd5IGluIE51Y2xlYXIgUmVhY3Rpb25z_66-nij}

Einstein’s equation helps scientists understand what happens in nuclear
reactions and why they produce so much energy. When the nucleus of a
radioisotope undergoes fission or fusion in a nuclear reaction, it loses
a tiny amount of mass. What happens to the lost mass? It isn’t really
lost at all. It is converted to energy. How much energy? E = mc ^2^ .
The change in mass is tiny, but it results in a great deal of energy.

**Q** : In a nuclear reaction, mass decreases and energy increases. What
about the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy? Are
mass and energy not conserved in nuclear reactions? Do we need to throw
out these laws when it comes to nuclear reactions?

**A** : No, the laws still apply. However, it’s more correct to say that
the sum of mass and energy is always conserved in a nuclear reaction.
Mass changes to energy, but the total amount of mass and energy combined
remains the same.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._66-3nm}

Einstein’s equation, E = mc ^2^ , shows that matter and energy are two
forms of the same thing. It also shows that there is a tremendous amount
of energy (E) in a small mass (m) of matter.

-   In nuclear reactions, matter changes to energy, but the total amount
    of mass and energy together does not change.

It’s a bird! It’s plane! It’s a super skateboarder! This boy appears to
be flying high in the sky, but he can’t stay airborne for long. Gravity
will soon pull him back to the ground. How was he able to overcome the
force of gravity and rise into the air? In this unit, you’ll learn about
forces such as gravity and motions such as skateboarding, including how
skateboarders can seem to defy gravity. Along the way, you can also pick
up some cool skateboarding tips!

The wings of this hummingbird are moving so fast that they’re just a
blur of motion. You can probably think of many other examples of things
in motion. If you can’t, just look around you. It’s likely that you’ll
see something moving, and if nothing else, your eyes will be moving. So
you know from experience what motion is. No doubt it seems like a fairly
simple concept. However, when you read this article, you’ll find out
that it’s not quite as simple as it seems.

### Defining Motion {#5.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgTW90aW9u-86k}

In science, **motion** is defined as a change in position. An object’s
position is its location. Besides the wings of the hummingbird in the
opening image, you can see other examples of motion in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW90aW9u) . In each case, the position of
something is changing.

**Q** : In each picture in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW90aW9u) , what is moving and how is its
position changing?

**A** : The train and all its passengers are speeding straight down a
track to the next station. The man and his bike are racing along a
curving highway. The geese are flying over their wetland environment.
The meteor is shooting through the atmosphere toward Earth, burning up
as it goes.

### Frame of Reference {#5.html#x-ck12-RnJhbWUgb2YgUmVmZXJlbmNl-bou}

There’s more to motion than objects simply changing position. You’ll see
why when you consider the following example. Assume that the school bus
pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtS2lkc2FuZEJ1cw..) passes by you as you
stand on the sidewalk. It’s obvious to you that the bus is moving, but
what about to the children inside the bus? The bus isn’t moving relative
to them, and if they look at the other children sitting on the bus, they
won’t appear to be moving either. If the ride is really smooth, the
children may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out
the window and seeing you and the trees whizzing by.

**Figure 5.2**

</div>

This example shows that how we perceive motion depends on our frame of
reference. **Frame of reference** refers to something that is not moving
with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion. For the
children on the bus, if they use other children riding the bus as their
frame of reference, they do not appear to be moving. But if they use
objects outside the bus as their frame of reference, they can tell they
are moving. The video at the URL below illustrates other examples of how
frame of reference is related to motion.

**Q** : What is your frame of reference if you are standing on the
sidewalk and see the bus go by? How can you tell that the bus is moving?

**A** : Your frame of reference might be the trees and other stationary
objects across the street. As the bus goes by, it momentarily blocks
your view of these objects, and this helps you detect the bus’ motion.

Do you participate in track like the boys pictured here? If not, you may
have attended a track meet. The boys in the picture are running a
100-meter sprint. Running events in track are named for their distance.

### What Is Distance? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBEaXN0YW5jZT8._1-lef}

**Distance** is the length of the route between two points. The distance
of a race, for example, is the length of the track between the starting
and finishing lines. In a 100-meter sprint, that distance is 100 meters.

### SI Unit for Distance {#5.html#x-ck12-U0kgVW5pdCBmb3IgRGlzdGFuY2U._1-nfw}

The SI unit for distance is the meter (m). Short distances may be
measured in centimeters (cm), and long distances may be measured in
kilometers (km). For example, you might measure the distance from the
bottom to the top of a sheet of paper in centimeters and the distance
from your house to your school in kilometers.

### Using Maps to Measure Distance {#5.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgTWFwcyB0byBNZWFzdXJlIERpc3RhbmNl_1-0ll}

Maps can often be used to measure distance. The map in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnR3aXRoUm9zZQ..) shows the route
from Jordan’s house to his school. You can use the scale at the bottom
of the map to measure the distance between these two points.

Imagine traveling several miles in one of the directions indicated by
this sign. Now suppose that a friend travels the same distance in
another direction indicated by the sign. You and your friend would end
up in very different locations. Obviously, direction is an important
component of motion.

### Introducing Direction {#5.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgRGlyZWN0aW9u_2-wwt}

Direction can be described in relative terms, such as up, down, in, out,
left, right, forward, backward, or sideways. Direction can also be
described with the cardinal directions: north, south, east, or west. On
maps, cardinal directions are indicated with a compass rose. You can see
one in the bottom left corner of the map in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnRMYXJnZVJvc2U.) . You can use the
compass rose to find directions on the map. For example, to go to the
school from Jordan’s house, you would travel from east to west. If you
wanted to go on to the post office, you would change direction at the
school and then travel from south to north.

**Figure 5.4**

</div>

### Why Direction Is Important {#5.html#x-ck12-V2h5IERpcmVjdGlvbiBJcyBJbXBvcnRhbnQ._2-f01}

Look again at the map in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnRMYXJnZVJvc2U.) . The distance from
Jordan’s house to the post office is 3 km. But if Jordan told a friend
how to reach the post office from his house, he couldn’t just say “go 3
kilometers.” The friend might end up at the park instead of the post
office. Jordan would have to include direction as well as distance. He
could say, “go west for 2 kilometers and then go north for 1 kilometer.”

### Motion and Vectors {#5.html#x-ck12-TW90aW9uIGFuZCBWZWN0b3Jz_2-jrl}

When both distance and direction are considered, motion can be
represented by a vector. A **vector** is a measurement that has both
size and direction. It may be represented by an arrow. If you are
representing motion with an arrow, the length of the arrow represents
distance, and the way the arrow points represents direction. The red
arrows on the map in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnRMYXJnZVJvc2U.) are vectors for
Jordan’s route from his house to the school and from the school to the
post office. If you want to learn more about vectors, watch the video at
this URL:

directions from the post office to the park on the map in the **Figure**

**A:** The vectors would look like this:

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-wy3}

-   Direction is an important component of motion.
-   A compass rose shows cardinal directions on a map.
-   A vector is a measurement that has both size and direction and may

120 km/h (about 75 mi/h). For a male athlete, the ball may travel even
faster. A fast-pitch pitcher uses a “windmill” motion to throw the ball.
This is a different technique than other softball pitches, and it
explains why the ball travels so fast.

### Introducing Speed {#5.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgU3BlZWQ._3-myp}

How fast or slow something moves is its **speed** . Speed determines how
far something travels in a given amount of time. The SI unit for speed
is meters per second (m/s). Speed may be constant, but often it varies
from moment to moment.

### Average Speed {#5.html#x-ck12-QXZlcmFnZSBTcGVlZA.._3-eb8}

Even if speed varies during the course of a trip, it’s easy to calculate
the average speed by using this formula:

![\\text{speed}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}](ck12_math_images_dir/a60713669bd30a1927b8f358865b079a.png)

For example, assume you go on a car trip with your family. The total
distance you travel is 120 miles, and it takes 3 hours to travel that
far. The average speed for the trip is:

![\\text{speed} & =\\frac{120 \\ \\text{mi}}{3 \\ \\text{h}}\\\\\\& =40
\\
\\text{mi/h}](ck12_math_images_dir/45647a26f649906944bc61d8e7e66f2d.png)

**Q:** Terri rode her bike very slowly to the top of a big hill. Then
she coasted back down the hill at a much faster speed. The distance from
the bottom to the top of the hill is 3 kilometers. It took Terri ¼ hour
to make the round trip. What was her average speed for the entire trip?
( *Hint* : The round-trip distance is 6 km.)

**A:** Terri’s speed can be calculated as follows:

![\\text{speed} & =\\frac{6 \\ \\text{km}}{0.25 \\ \\text{h}}\\\\\\& =24
\\
\\text{km/h}](ck12_math_images_dir/1da84eb858dc7c84f3206e684b669620.png)

### Instantaneous Speed {#5.html#x-ck12-SW5zdGFudGFuZW91cyBTcGVlZA.._3-cqu}

When you travel by car, you usually don’t move at a constant speed.
Instead you go faster or slower depending on speed limits, traffic
lights, the number of vehicles on the road, and other factors. For
example, you might travel 65 miles per hour on a highway but only 20
miles per hour on a city street (see the pictures in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2Fycw..) .) You might come to a complete
stop at traffic lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to
pass other cars. Therefore, your speed at any given instant, or your
instantaneous speed, may be very different than your speed at other
times. Instantaneous speed is much more difficult to calculate than
average speed. If you want to learn more about calculating speed, watch

### Calculating Distance or Time from Speed {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgRGlzdGFuY2Ugb3IgVGltZSBmcm9tIFNwZWVk_3-elw}

If you know the average speed of a moving object, you can calculate the
distance it will travel in a given period of time or the time it will
take to travel a given distance. To calculate distance from speed and
time, use this version of the average speed formula given above:

distance = speed × time

For example, if a car travels at an average speed of 60 km/h for 5
hours, then the distance it travels is:

distance = 60 km/h × 5 h = 300 km

To calculate time from speed and distance, use this version of the
formula:

![\\text{time}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}](ck12_math_images_dir/1de14b899481f2f837ef99fb1978ed03.png)

**Q:** If you walk 6 km at an average speed of 3 km/h, how much time
does it take?

**A:** Use the formula for time as follows:

![\\text{time} & =\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}}\\\\\\&
=\\frac{6 \\ \\text{km}}{3 \\ \\text{km/h}}\\\\\\& =2 \\
\\text{h}](ck12_math_images_dir/97c5c96240e74997d2fd78b4bb211bc2.png)

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-bfx}

-   How fast or slow something moves is its speed. The SI unit for speed
    is meters per second (m/s).
-   Average speed is calculated with this formula:
    ![\\text{speed}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}](ck12_math_images_dir/a60713669bd30a1927b8f358865b079a.png)
-   Speed may be constant, but often it varies from moment to moment.
    Speed at any given instant is called instantaneous speed. It is much
    more difficult to calculate than average speed.
-   Distance or time can be calculated by solving the average speed
    formula for distance or time.

velocity.

**Q:** What’s missing from the graph being drawn in the picture above?

**A:** The x- and y-axes are missing.

### Graphing Position and Time {#5.html#x-ck12-R3JhcGhpbmcgUG9zaXRpb24gYW5kIFRpbWU._4-la9}

The motion of an object can be represented by a position-time graph like
Graph 1 in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR3JhcGgx) . In
this type of graph, the y-axis represents position relative to the
starting point, and the x-axis represents time. A position-time graph
shows how far an object has traveled from its starting position at any
given time since it started moving.

### Slope Equals Velocity {#5.html#x-ck12-U2xvcGUgRXF1YWxzIFZlbG9jaXR5_4-ugx}

In a position-time graph, the velocity of the moving object is
represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line. If the graph
line is horizontal, like the line after time = 5 seconds in Graph 2 in
the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR3JhcGgy) , then the slope
is zero and so is the velocity. The position of the object is not
changing. The steeper the line is, the greater the slope of the line is
and the faster the object’s motion is changing.

It’s easy to calculate the average velocity of a moving object from a
position-time graph. **Average velocity** equals the change in position
(represented by Δd) divided by the corresponding change in time
(represented by Δt):

For example, in Graph 2 in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR3JhcGgy) , the average velocity between
0 seconds and 5 seconds is:

![\\text{velocity} & = \\frac{\\Delta d}{\\Delta t}\\\\\\& =\\frac{25 \\

    position relative to the starting point on the y-axis and time on
    the x-axis.
-   The slope of a position-time graph represents velocity. The steeper
    the slope is, the faster the motion is changing.
-   Average velocity can be calculated from a position-time graph as the

Ramey and her mom were driving down this highway at 45 miles per hour,
which is the speed limit on this road. As they approached this sign,
Ramey’s mom put on the brakes and started to slow down so she could
safely maneuver the upcoming curves in the road. This speed limit sign
actually represents two components of motion: speed and direction.

### Speed and Direction {#5.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWQgYW5kIERpcmVjdGlvbg.._5-zqf}

Speed tells you only how fast or slow an object is moving. It doesn’t
tell you the direction the object is moving. The measure of both speed
and direction is called **velocity** . Velocity is a vector. A
**vector** is measurement that includes both size and direction. Vectors
are often represented by arrows. When using an arrow to represent
velocity, the length of the arrow stands for speed, and the way the
arrow points indicates the direction. If you’re still not sure of the
difference between speed and velocity, watch the cartoon at this URL:

### Using Vector Arrows to Represent Velocity {#5.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgVmVjdG9yIEFycm93cyB0byBSZXByZXNlbnQgVmVsb2NpdHk._5-3te}

The arrows in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmVjdG9ycw..) represent the velocity of
three different objects. Arrows A and B are the same length but point in
different directions. They represent objects moving at the same speed
but in different directions. Arrow C is shorter than arrow A or B but
points in the same direction as arrow A. It represents an object moving
at a slower speed than A or B but in the same direction as A.

### Differences in Velocity {#5.html#x-ck12-RGlmZmVyZW5jZXMgaW4gVmVsb2NpdHk._5-in5}

Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same speed
and in the same direction. Objects moving at different speeds, in
different directions, or both have different velocities. Look again at
arrows A and B from the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmVjdG9ycw..) . They represent objects
that have different velocities only because they are moving in different
directions. A and C represent objects that have different velocities
only because they are moving at different speeds. Objects represented by
B and C have different velocities because they are moving in different
directions and at different speeds.

**Q:** Jerod is riding his bike at a constant speed. As he rides down
his street he is moving from east to west. At the end of the block, he
turns right and starts moving from south to north, but he’s still
traveling at the same speed. Has his velocity changed?

**A:** Although Jerod’s speed hasn’t changed, his velocity has changed
because he is moving in a different direction.

**Q:** How could you use vector arrows to represent Jerod’s velocity and
how it changes?

**A:** The arrows might look like this:

### Calculating Average Velocity {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgQXZlcmFnZSBWZWxvY2l0eQ.._5-cuq}

You can calculate the average velocity of a moving object that is not
changing direction by dividing the distance the object travels by the
time it takes to travel that distance. You would use this formula:

![\\text{velocity}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}](ck12_math_images_dir/e13dd35e898c2f483eeb8ca320383b00.png)

This is the same formula that is used for calculating average speed. It
represents velocity only if the answer also includes the direction that
the object is traveling.

Let’s work through a sample problem. Toni’s dog is racing down the
sidewalk toward the east. The dog travels 36 meters in 18 seconds before
it stops running. The velocity of the dog is:

![\\text{velocity} & =\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\\\\\\&
=\\frac{36 \\ \\text{m}}{18 \\ \\text{s}}\\\\\\& =2 \\ \\text{m/s
east}](ck12_math_images_dir/37840b1ebff95de9f929f7a44001abd7.png)

Note that the answer is given in the SI unit for velocity, which is m/s,
and it includes the direction that the dog is traveling.

**Q:** What would the dog’s velocity be if it ran the same distance in
the opposite direction but covered the distance in 24 seconds?

**A:** In this case, the velocity would be:

![\\text{velocity} & =\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\\\\\\&
=\\frac{36 \\ \\text{m}}{24 \\ \\text{s}}\\\\\\& =1.5 \\ \\text{m/s
west}](ck12_math_images_dir/d5f5ceb19d7b447438673dc0f6a4da31.png)

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-fki}

-   Velocity is a measure of both speed and direction of motion.
    Velocity is a vector, which is a measurement that includes both size
    and direction.
-   Velocity can be represented by an arrow, with the length of the
    arrow representing speed and the way the arrow points
    representing direction.
-   Objects have the same velocity only if they are moving at the same
    speed and in the same direction. Objects moving at different speeds,
    in different directions, or both have different velocities.
-   The average velocity of an object moving in a constant direction is
    calculated with the formula:
    ![\\text{velocity}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}](ck12_math_images_dir/cf31f707d91252edd417cd6794d1656f.png) .

Imagine the thrill of riding on a roller coaster like this one! The
coaster slowly crawls to the top of the track and then flies down the
other side. It also zooms around twists and turns at breakneck speeds.
These changes in speed and direction are what make a roller coaster ride
so exciting. Changes in speed or direction are called acceleration.

### Defining Acceleration {#5.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9u_6-s5b}

**Acceleration** is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving
object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in
turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in
velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both.
Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement
that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration
as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration.
In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change
in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.

**Q:** Can you think of an example of acceleration that doesn’t involve
a change in speed?

**A:** Driving at a constant speed around a bend in a road is one
example. Use your imagination to think of others.

### Examples of Acceleration {#5.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9u_6-udp}

You can see several examples of acceleration in the pictures from the
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9u) . In each
example, velocity is changing but in different ways. For example,
direction may be changing but not speed, or vice versa. Figure out what
is moving and how it’s moving in each of the photos.

**Q:** Describe how velocity is changing in each of the motions you
identified from the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9u) .

**A:** You should describe how both direction and speed are changing.
For example, the boy on the carousel is moving up and down and around in
a circle, so his direction is constantly changing, but his speed changes
only at the beginning and end of the ride. The skydiver is falling
straight down toward the ground so her direction isn’t changing, but her
speed keeps increasing as she falls until she opens her parachute. For a
better understanding of the changing velocity of a skydiver, watch the

### Feeling Acceleration {#5.html#x-ck12-RmVlbGluZyBBY2NlbGVyYXRpb24._6-wtv}

If you are accelerating, you may be able to feel the change in velocity.
This is true whether the change is in speed, direction, or both. You
often feel acceleration when you ride in a car. As the car speeds up,
you feel as though you are being pressed against the seat. When the car
slows down, you feel like you are being pushed forward, especially if
the change in speed is sudden. If the car changes direction and turns
right, you feel as though you are being pushed to the left. With a left
turn, you feel a push to the right. The next time you ride in a car,
notice how it feels as the car accelerates in each of these ways. You
can also simulate acceleration at this URL:

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-b7z}

-   Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a
    moving object. It measures the rate at which the change
    is occurring. It may reflect a change in speed, a change in
    direction, or both. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector.
-   Examples of acceleration include a person riding a carousel and a
    skydiver in free fall.
-   When you experience acceleration, you may be able to feel the
    changes in speed and/or direction.

This cyclist is in constant motion as he competes in an off-road
mountain bike race. Both his speed and his direction keep changing.
Velocity is a measure that represents both speed and direction. Changes
in velocity are measured by **acceleration** . Acceleration reflects how
quickly velocity is changing. It may involve a change in speed, a change
in direction, or both. You can see off-road bikers accelerating in these
ways in the exciting mountain bike race at this URL:
[http://vimeo.com/1630019](1630019)

### Calculating Average Acceleration in One Direction {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgQXZlcmFnZSBBY2NlbGVyYXRpb24gaW4gT25lIERpcmVjdGlvbg.._7-a45}

Calculating acceleration is complicated if both speed and direction are
changing or if you want to know acceleration at any given instant in
time. However, it’s relatively easy to calculate average acceleration
over a period of time when only speed is changing. Then acceleration is
the change in velocity (represented by Δv) divided by the change in time
(represented by Δt):

![\\text{acceleration}=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta
t}](ck12_math_images_dir/2192764f9acacc80772a0a2fa62ec4c7.png)

### Accelerating on a Bike {#5.html#x-ck12-QWNjZWxlcmF0aW5nIG9uIGEgQmlrZQ.._7-jhk}

Look at the cyclist in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmlrZWRvd24.) . With the help of gravity,
he speeds up as he goes downhill on a straight part of the trail. His
velocity changes from 1 meter per second at the top of the hill to 6
meters per second by the time he reaches the bottom. If it takes him 5
seconds to reach the bottom, what is his average acceleration as he
races down the hill?

![\\text{acceleration} & =\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} \\\\\\ & =
\\frac{6 \\ \\text{m/s}-1 \\ \\text{m/s}}{5 \\ \\text{s}} \\\\\\ & =
\\frac{5 \\ \\text{m/s}}{5 \\ \\text{s}} \\\\\\ & = \\frac{1 \\
\\text{m/s}}{1 \\ \\text{s}} \\\\\\ & = 1 \\ \\text{m/s}\^2
](ck12_math_images_dir/0574712b5ced4a9c337cf18a719f379c.png)

In words, this means that for each second the cyclist travels downhill,
his velocity (in this case, his speed) increases by 1 meter per second
on average. Note that the answer to this problem is expressed in m/s ^2^
, which is the SI unit for acceleration.

**Q:** The cyclist slows down at the end of the race. His velocity
changes from 6 m/s to 2 m/s during a period of 4 seconds without any
change in direction. What was his average acceleration during these 4
seconds?

**A:** Use the equation given above for acceleration:

The sprinter in this image is just taking off from the starting blocks
to run a short race down a straight track. She starts in a burst of
speed and will pick up even more speed during the first few seconds of
the race. She’ll keep running at top speed until she crosses the finish
line. Only then will she slow down. **Velocity** is a measure of both
speed and direction of motion. A change in velocity is called
acceleration. In the case of the sprinter, she accelerates as she runs
down the track because her speed is changing even though her direction
stays the same. If you need a review of acceleration, watch the musical

The changing velocity of the sprinter—or of any other moving person or
object—can be represented by a velocity-time graph like the one in the
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmVsb2NpdHlHcmFwaA..) for the

The sprinter’s velocity increases for the first 4 seconds of the race,
it remains constant for the next 3 seconds, and it decreases during the
last 3 seconds after she crosses the finish line.

### Acceleration and Slope {#5.html#x-ck12-QWNjZWxlcmF0aW9uIGFuZCBTbG9wZQ.._8-i0b}

In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope, or
steepness, of the graph line. If the line slopes upward, like the line
between 0 and 4 seconds in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmVsb2NpdHlHcmFwaA..) , velocity is
increasing, so acceleration is positive. If the line is horizontal, as
it is between 4 and 7 seconds, velocity is constant and acceleration is
zero. If the line slopes downward, like the line between 7 and 10
seconds, velocity is decreasing and acceleration is negative. Negative
acceleration is called deceleration.

**Q:** Assume that another sprinter is running the same race. The other
runner reaches a top velocity of 9 m/s by 4 seconds after the start of
the race. How would the first 4 seconds of the velocity-time graph for
this runner be different from the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmVsb2NpdHlHcmFwaA..) ?

**A:** The graph line for this runner during seconds 0–4 would be
steeper (have a greater slope). This would show that acceleration is
greater during this time period for the other sprinter.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-7us}

    over time.

Carson has been riding a scooter for almost as long as he can remember.
As you can see, he’s really good at it. He can even do tricks in the
air. It takes a lot of practice to be able to control a scooter like
this. Carson automatically applies just the right forces to control his
scooter.  

### Defining Force {#5.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgRm9yY2U._9-lw6}

**Force** is defined as a push or pull acting on an object. There are
several fundamental forces in the universe, including the force of
gravity, electromagnetic force, and weak and strong nuclear forces. When
it comes to the motion of everyday objects, however, the forces of
interest include mainly gravity, friction, and applied force. Applied
force is force that a person or thing applies to an object.

**Q** : What forces act on Carson’s scooter?

**A** : Gravity, friction, and applied forces all act on Carson’s
scooter. Gravity keeps pulling both Carson and the scooter toward the
ground. Friction between the wheels of the scooter and the ground
prevent the scooter from sliding but also slow it down. In addition,
Carson applies forces to his scooter to control its speed and direction.

### Force and Motion {#5.html#x-ck12-Rm9yY2UgYW5kIE1vdGlvbg.._9-zvo}

Forces cause all motions. Everytime the motion of an object changes,
it’s because a force has been applied to it. Force can cause a
stationary object to start moving or a moving object to change its speed
or direction or both. A change in the speed or direction of an object is
called acceleration. Look at Carson’s brother Colton in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVzaFNjb290ZXI.) . He’s getting his
scooter started by pushing off with his foot. The force he applies to
the ground with his foot starts the scooter moving in the opposite
direction. The harder he pushes against the ground, the faster the
scooter will go.

<div id="5.html#x-ck12-MGNkYjkzOWNhMDhlNzE2ZDYyNzE0NmJmNTM4NWIyMTA.-h8p"

**Figure 5.12**

</div>

How much an object accelerates when a force is applied to it depends not
only on the strength of the force but also on the object’s mass. For
example, a heavier scooter would be harder to accelerate. Colton would
have to push with more force to start it moving and move it faster. You
can explore the how force, mass, and acceleration are related by doing
the activity at this URL:

[http://www.harcourtschool.com/activity/newton/]()

**Q** : What units do you think are used to measure force?

**A** : The SI unit for force is the Newton (N). A **Newton** is the
force needed to cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate at 1 m/s ^2^ ,
so a Newton equals 1 kg • m/s ^2^ . The Newton was named for the
scientist Sir Isaac Newton, who is famous for his laws of motion and
gravity.

### Force as a Vector {#5.html#x-ck12-Rm9yY2UgYXMgYSBWZWN0b3I._9-zqz}

Force is a vector, or a measure that has both size and direction. For
example, Colton pushes on the ground in the opposite direction that the
scooter moves, so that’s the direction of the force he is applies. He
can give the scooter a strong push or a weak push. That’s the size of
the force. Like other vectors, a force can be represented with an arrow.
You can see some examples in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnRBcnJvdw..) . The length of each
arrow represents the strength of the force, and the way the arrow points
represents the direction of the force.

**Figure 5.13**

</div>

**Q** : How could you use arrows to represent the forces that start
Colton’s scooter moving?

**A** : Colton pushes against the ground behind him (to the right in the
**Figure** [above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVzaFNjb290ZXI.) ). The
ground pushes back with equal force to the left, causing the scooter to
move in that direction. Force arrows A and B in example 2 in the
**Figure** [above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVzaFNjb290ZXI.) ) could
represent these forces.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-wsa}

-   Force is defined as a push or pull acting on an object. Forces
    include gravity, friction, and applied force.
-   Force causes changes in the speed or direction of motion. These
    changes are called acceleration.
-   The SI unit for force is the Newton (N).
-   Force is a vector because it has both size and direction. Like other
    vectors, it can be represented by an arrow.

It’s boys against girls in this friendly tug of war. The two teams are
pulling the rope in opposite directions. Which team do you think will
win? It depends on which side pulls on the rope with the greatest force.
As this example shows, more than one force may act on an object at the
same time. Would it surprise you to learn that at least two different
forces are acting on you as you read this article? Can you guess what
they are?

### Pulling Down and Pushing Up {#5.html#x-ck12-UHVsbGluZyBEb3duIGFuZCBQdXNoaW5nIFVw_10-h1r}

One force acting on you—and all the other objects on Earth—is gravity.
Look at the physics book in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRm9yY2U.) . Gravity pulls the book
downward with a force of 20 Newtons. Why doesn’t the book fall to the
ground? The table pushes upward on the book with the same amount of
force. The combined force, or **net force** , acting on the book is 0
Newtons. That’s because upward and downward forces are balanced, so they
cancel out. You can learn more about net force at this URL:

### Forces Acting in Opposite Directions {#5.html#x-ck12-Rm9yY2VzIEFjdGluZyBpbiBPcHBvc2l0ZSBEaXJlY3Rpb25z_10-hmy}

In general, whenever forces act on an object in opposite directions—like
the book on the table—the net force is equal to the difference between
the two forces. In other words, one force is subtracted from the other
to calculate the net force. If the opposing forces are equal, or
balanced, the net force is zero, as it is for the book. That’s why the
book doesn’t fall to the ground but instead remains resting on the
table. However, if the opposing forces are unbalanced, the net force is
greater than zero, although it will be less than either of the
individual forces. In this case, the object will move in the same
direction as the net force.

Look at the dogs playing tug-of-war in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRG9ncw..) . The dogs are pulling the rope
in opposite directions, but one dog is pulling with more force than the
other. The net force acting on the rope is 2 Newtons to the right, so
the rope will move to the right.

If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force is
equal to the sum of the two forces. This always results in a stronger
force than either of the individual forces alone. In the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGlhbm8.) , after the man on the left
picks up the couch, he will push the couch to the right with a force of
25 Newtons, and the man on the right will pull the couch to the right
with a force of 20 Newtons. The net force on the couch is 45 Newtons to
the right, so that’s the way the couch will move.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-xed}

-   The net force acting on an object is the combination of all of the
    individual forces acting on it.
-   If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the net force
    is the difference between the two forces. In this case, the net
    force is always greater than or equal to zero but less than either
    of the individual forces.
-   If two forces act on an object in the same direction, the net force
    is the sum of the two forces. In this case, the net force is always
    greater than either of the individual forces.

Did you ever rub your hands together to warm them up, like the young man
in the opening image? Why does this make your hands warmer? The answer
is friction.

### What Is Friction? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBGcmljdGlvbj8._11-phe}

**Friction** is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that
are touching. Friction can work for or against us. For example, putting
sand on an icy sidewalk increases friction so you are less likely to
slip. On the other hand, too much friction between moving parts in a car
engine can cause the parts to wear out. Other examples of friction are
illustrated in the two **Figures**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVXNlZnVs) and
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHJvYmxlbXM.) . You can see an animation

### Why Friction Occurs {#5.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEZyaWN0aW9uIE9jY3Vycw.._11-wmb}

Friction occurs because no surface is perfectly smooth. Even surfaces
that look smooth to the unaided eye make look rough or bumpy when viewed
under a microscope. Look at the metal surfaces in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWV0YWxz) . The aluminum foil is so
smooth that it’s shiny. However, when highly magnified, the surface of
metal appears to be very bumpy. All those mountains and valleys catch
and grab the mountains and valleys of any other surface that contacts
the metal. This creates friction.

### Factors That Affect Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEFmZmVjdCBGcmljdGlvbg.._11-aoh}

Rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces.
That’s why we put sand on icy sidewalks and roads. You can’t slide as
far across ice with shoes as you can on the blades of skates (see
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSWNlc2thdGVz) ). The rougher
surface of the soles of the shoes causes more friction and slows you
down.

</div>

**Q** : Heavier objects also have more friction. Can you explain why?

**A** : Heavier objects press together with greater force, and this
causes greater friction between them. Did you ever try to furniture
across the floor? It’s harder to overcome friction between a heavier
piece of furniture and the floor than between lighter pieces and the
floor.

### Friction Produces Heat {#5.html#x-ck12-RnJpY3Rpb24gUHJvZHVjZXMgSGVhdA.._11-ulm}

You know that friction produces heat. That’s why rubbing your hands
together makes them warmer. But do you know why? Friction causes the
molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster, so they have more energy.
This gives them a higher temperature, and they feel warmer. Heat from
friction can be useful. It not only warms your hands. It also lets you
light a match as shown in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWF0Y2g.) . On the other hand, heat from
friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem.
It can cause the car to overheat.

**Q** : How is friction reduced between the moving parts inside a car
engine?

**A** : To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. The oil coats
the surfaces of the moving parts and makes them slippery. They slide
over each other more easily, so there is less friction.

Climbing a vertical rock wall means pitting your strength and stamina
against the force of gravity, which pulls you down toward the ground.
Another force helps you to climb the vertical rock wall by keeping your
hands and feet from slipping. That force is friction.

### Four Types of Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-Rm91ciBUeXBlcyBvZiBGcmljdGlvbg.._12-thu}

**Friction** is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that
are in contact. There are four types of friction: static, sliding,
rolling, and fluid friction. Static, sliding, and rolling friction occur
between solid surfaces. Fluid friction occurs in liquids and gases. All
four types of friction are described below. You can see a video
demonstration of the different types at this URL:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bXpYblzkR0](watch?v=0bXpYblzkR0)

### Static Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-U3RhdGljIEZyaWN0aW9u_12-4pb}

Static friction acts on objects when they are resting on a surface. For
example, if you are hiking in the woods, there is static friction
between your shoes and the trail each time you put down your foot (see
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2Fsa2Vycw..) ). Without this
static friction, your feet would slip out from under you, making it
difficult to walk. In fact, that’s exactly what happens if you try to
walk on ice. That’s because ice is very slippery and offers very little
friction.

**Figure 5.24**

</div>

**Q** : Can you think of other examples of static friction?

**A** : One example is the friction that helps the people climb the rock
wall in the opening picture above. Static friction keeps their hands and
feet from slipping.

### Sliding Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-U2xpZGluZyBGcmljdGlvbg.._12-uh2}

Sliding friction is friction that acts on objects when they are sliding
over a surface. Sliding friction is weaker than static friction. That’s
why it’s easier to slide a piece of furniture over the floor after you
start it moving than it is to get it moving in the first place. Sliding
friction can be useful. For example, you use sliding friction when you
write with a pencil. The pencil “lead” slides easily over the paper, but
there’s just enough friction between the pencil and paper to leave a
mark.

**Q** : How does sliding friction help you ride a bike?

**A** : There is sliding friction between the brake pads and bike rims
each time you use your bike’s brakes. This friction slows the rolling
wheels so you can stop.

### Rolling Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-Um9sbGluZyBGcmljdGlvbg.._12-fts}

Rolling friction is friction that acts on objects when they are rolling
over a surface. Rolling friction is much weaker than sliding friction or
static friction. This explains why most forms of ground transportation
use wheels, including bicycles, cars, 4-wheelers, roller skates,
scooters, and skateboards. Ball bearings are another use of rolling
friction. You can see what they look like in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmFsbEJlYXJpbmdz) . They let parts of a
wheel or other machine roll rather than slide over on another.

outer cylinders when they turn.

</div>

### Fluid Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-Rmx1aWQgRnJpY3Rpb24._12-zzo}

Fluid friction is friction that acts on objects that are moving through
a fluid. A **fluid** is a substance that can flow and take the shape of
its container. Fluids include liquids and gases. If you’ve ever tried to
push your open hand through the water in a tub or pool, then you’ve
experienced fluid friction. You can feel the resistance of the water
against your hand. Look at the skydiver in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGFyYWNodXRlcg..) . He’s falling toward
Earth with a parachute. Resistance of the air against the parachute
slows his descent. The faster or larger a moving object is, the greater
is the fluid friction resisting its motion. That’s why there is greater
air resistance against the parachute than the skydiver’s body.

Long, long ago, when the universe was still young, an incredible force
caused dust and gas particles to pull together to form the objects in
our solar system. From the smallest moon to our enormous sun, this force
created not only our solar system, but all the solar systems in all the
galaxies of the universe. The force is gravity.

### Defining Gravity {#5.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgR3Jhdml0eQ.._13-uql}

**Gravity** has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction
between things that have mass. According to this conception of gravity,
anything that has mass, no matter how small, exerts gravity on other
matter. Gravity can act between objects that are not even touching. In
fact, gravity can act over very long distances. However, the farther two
objects are from each other, the weaker is the force of gravity between
them. Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive
objects.

### Earth’s Gravity {#5.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIEdyYXZpdHk._13-rj2}

You are already very familiar with Earth’s gravity. It constantly pulls
you toward the center of the planet. It prevents you and everything else
on Earth from being flung out into space as the planet spins on its
axis. It also pulls objects that are above the surface—from meteors to
skydivers—down to the ground. Gravity between Earth and the moon and
between Earth and artificial satellites keeps all these objects circling
around Earth. Gravity also keeps Earth and the other planets moving
around the much more massive sun.

**Q** : There is a force of gravity between Earth and you and also
between you and all the objects around you. When you drop a paper clip,
why doesn’t it fall toward you instead of toward Earth?

**A** : Earth is so much more massive than you that its gravitational
pull on the paper clip is immensely greater.

### Gravity and Weight {#5.html#x-ck12-R3Jhdml0eSBhbmQgV2VpZ2h0_13-6wc}

Weight measures the force of gravity pulling downward on an object. The
SI unit for weight, like other forces, is the Newton (N). On Earth, a
mass of 1 kilogram has a weight of about 10 Newtons because of the pull
of Earth’s gravity. On the moon, which has less gravity, the same mass
would weigh less. Weight is measured with a scale, like the spring scale
shown in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW9uZXk.) . The
scale measures the force with which gravity pulls an object downward. To
delve a little deeper into weight and gravity, watch this video:

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-l2p}

-   Gravity has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction
    between things that have mass. The strength of gravity between two
    objects depends on their mass and their distance apart.
-   Earth’s gravity constantly pulls matter toward the center of
    the planet. It also keeps moons and satellites orbiting Earth and
    Earth orbiting the sun.
-   Weight measures the force of gravity pulling on an object. The SI
    unit for weight is the Newton (N).

You may have heard a story about Isaac Newton coming up with the idea of
gravity when an apple fell out of a tree and hit him in the head. The
story isn’t true, but seeing how things like apples fall to Earth helped
Newton form his ideas about gravity, the force of attraction between
things that have mass. Of course, people had known about the effects of
gravity for thousands of years before Newton came along. After all, they
constantly experienced gravity in their daily lives. They observed over
and over again that things always fall toward the ground. However, it
wasn’t until Newton developed his law of gravity in the late 1600s that
people knew gravity applies to everything in the universe that has mass.

### Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation {#5.html#x-ck12-TmV3dG9u4oCZcyBMYXcgb2YgVW5pdmVyc2FsIEdyYXZpdGF0aW9u_14-u9a}

Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal and
affects all objects in the universe. That’s why Newton’s law of gravity
is called the **law of universal gravitation** . Universal gravitation
means that the force that causes an apple to fall from a tree to the
ground is the same force that causes the moon to keep moving around
Earth. Universal gravitation also means that while Earth exerts a pull
on you, you exert a pull on Earth. In fact, there is gravity between you
and every mass around you—your desk, your book, your pen. Even tiny
molecules of gas are attracted to one another by the force of gravity.
You can learn more about Newton’s law of gravity and how he developed it
in the video at this URL:

**Q** : Newton’s law of universal gravitation had a huge impact on how
people thought about the universe. Why do you think it was so important?

**A** : Newton’s law was the first scientific law that applied to the
entire universe. It explains the motion of objects not only on Earth but
in outer space as well.

### Factors That Influence the Strength of Gravity {#5.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEluZmx1ZW5jZSB0aGUgU3RyZW5ndGggb2YgR3Jhdml0eQ.._14-bdt}

Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any two
objects depends on two factors: the masses of the objects and the
distance between them.

-   Objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity
    between them. For example, because Earth is so massive, it attracts
    you and your desk more strongly that you and your desk attract
    each other. That’s why you and the desk remain in place on the floor
    rather than moving toward one another.
-   Objects that are closer together have a stronger force of gravity
    between them. For example, the moon is closer to Earth than it is to
    the more massive sun, so the force of gravity is greater between the
    moon and Earth than between the moon and the sun. That’s why the
    moon circles around Earth rather than the sun. You can see this in
    the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU1ZH) .

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-isa}

-   Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the force of
    gravity affects everything with mass in the universe.
-   Newton’s law also states that the strength of gravity between any
    two objects depends on the masses of the objects and the distance
    between them.

Why is jumping on a trampoline so much fun? Its springy surface helps
you jump higher than you ever could on the hard ground. But even on a
trampoline, you can’t keep jumping higher and higher. Gravity always
pulls you back down. You’ve probably known about gravity since you were
in elementary school. It’s the force that pulls all objects on Earth
down toward the ground. Is that all there is to gravity? Absolutely not!

### It Started with Newton {#5.html#x-ck12-SXQgU3RhcnRlZCB3aXRoIE5ld3Rvbg.._15-ext}

In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton introduced his law of gravity, which
identifies **gravity** as a force of attraction between all objects with
mass in the universe. The law also states that the strength of gravity
between two objects depends on their mass and distance apart. Newton’s
law of gravity was accepted for more than two centuries. It can predict
the motion of most objects and was even used by NASA to land astronauts
on the moon. It’s still used for most practical purposes. However,
Newton’s law doesn’t explain *why* gravity occurs. It only describes how
gravity seems to affect objects. There are also some cases in which
Newton’s law doesn’t even describe what happens.

**Q** : Newton expressed his ideas about gravity as a law. A law in
science is a description of what always occurs in nature. For example,
according to Newton’s law, objects on Earth always fall down, not up.
What is needed to explain gravity?

**A** : A theory is needed to explain gravity. In science, a theory is a
broad explanation that is supported by a great deal of evidence.

### Einstein Explained It All {#5.html#x-ck12-RWluc3RlaW4gRXhwbGFpbmVkIEl0IEFsbA.._15-bzi}

In the early 1900s, Albert Einstein came up with a theory of gravity
that actually explains gravity rather than simply describing its
effects. Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a
force that of attraction between all objects with mass, as Newton
thought. Instead, Einstein showed that gravity is a result of the
warping, or curving, of space and time, which made up the same
space-time “fabric.” These ideas about space-time and gravity became
known as Einstein’s theory of general relativity. If you watch the video
at the URL below, you can see how Einstein developed his theory. The
video may also help you understand how Einstein’s theory differs from
Newton’s law.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-p8yZYxNGc](watch?v=O-p8yZYxNGc)

### Visualizing Einstein’s Ideas {#5.html#x-ck12-VmlzdWFsaXppbmcgRWluc3RlaW7igJlzIElkZWFz_15-kee}

Einstein derived his theory using mathematics. However, you can get a
good grasp of it with the help of a simple visual analogy. Imagine a
bowling ball pressing down on a trampoline. The surface of the
trampoline would curve downward instead of being flat. Now imagine
placing a lighter ball at the edge of the trampoline. What will happen?
It will roll down toward the bowling ball. This apparent attraction to
the bowling ball occurs because the trampoline curves downward, not
because the two balls are actually attracted to one another by an
invisible force called gravity.

Einstein theorized that the sun and other very massive bodies affect
space and time around them in a way that is similar to the effect of the
bowling ball on the trampoline. The more massive a body is, the more it
causes space-time to curve. This idea is represented by the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTkFTQQ..) . According to Einstein,
objects move toward one another because of the curves in space-time, not
because they are pulling on each other with a force of attraction.
Einstein’s theory is supported by evidence and widely accepted today,
although Newton’s law is still used for many calculations. You can see
an animation of the warping of space-time at the following URL.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-p7s}

-   Newton’s law of gravity can predict the motion of most but not

    effects on the motion of objects.
-   Einstein showed mathematically that gravity is not really a force of

It’s a good thing this mountain climber’s safety gear is working,
because it’s a long way down to the ground! If he were to fall, he’d be
moving really fast by the time he got there. The higher any object
starts falling from above Earth’s surface, the faster it’s traveling by
the time it reaches the ground. Do you know why? The reason is gravity.
 

### Speeding up While Falling Down {#5.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWRpbmcgdXAgV2hpbGUgRmFsbGluZyBEb3du_16-mwg}

**Gravity** is a force that pulls objects down toward the ground. When
objects fall to the ground, gravity causes them to accelerate.
**Acceleration** is a change in velocity, and velocity, in turn, is a
measure of the speed and direction of motion. Gravity causes an object
to fall toward the ground at a faster and faster velocity the longer the
object falls. In fact, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s ^2^ , so by 1
second after an object starts falling, its velocity is 9.8 m/s. By 2
seconds after it starts falling, its velocity is 19.6 m/s (9.8 m/s + 9.8
m/s), and so on. The acceleration of a falling object due to gravity is
illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm95RHJvcA..) . For a more detailed
explanation of acceleration due to gravity, watch this video:

**Q** : In this diagram, the boy drops the object at time t = 0 s. By t
= 1 s, the object is falling at a velocity of 9.8 m/s. What is its

falling?

**A** : Its velocity at t = 5 s is 49.0 m/s, and at t = 6 s, it will be
58.8 m/s (49.0 m/s + 9.8 m/s).

### Mass and Acceleration Due to Gravity {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFzcyBhbmQgQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9uIER1ZSB0byBHcmF2aXR5_16-sso}

What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same
time from the same distance above the ground? The bowling ball has
greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is
greater. Would it fall to the ground faster? No, the bowling ball and
basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The more
massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass,
so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball. This
is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due
to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another.
For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a
falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can
simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by
doing the interactive animation at this URL:
[http://www.science-animations.com/support-files/freefall.swf](freefall.swf)

**Q** : If a leaf and an acorn were to fall to the ground in the absence
of air (that is, in a vacuum), how would this affect their acceleration
due to gravity?

**A** : They would both accelerate at the same rate and reach the ground
at the same time.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-dj8}

-   When gravity pulls objects toward the ground, it always causes them
    to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s ^2^ .
-   Regardless of differences in mass, all objects accelerate at the
    same rate due to gravity unless air resistance affects one more
    than another.

The archer in the opening image is aiming his arrow a little bit above
the bull’s eye of the target, rather than directly at it. Why doesn’t he
aim at the bull’s eye instead? The answer is projectile motion.

### Combining Forces {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29tYmluaW5nIEZvcmNlcw.._17-dip}

When the archer releases the bowstring, the arrow will be flung forward
toward the top of the target where she’s aiming. But another force will
also act on the arrow in a different direction. The other force is
gravity, and it will pull the arrow down toward Earth. The two forces
combined will cause the arrow to move in the curved path shown in the
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR29vZEFpbQ..) . This type of
motion is called **projectile motion** . It occurs whenever an object
curves down toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and
the downward force of gravity acting on it.

As you can see in this NASA photo, Earth is tiny compared with the
massive sun. The sun’s gravity is relatively strong because the force of
gravity between two objects is directly proportional to their masses.
Gravity between the sun and Earth pulls Earth toward the sun, but Earth
never falls into the sun. Instead, it constantly revolves around the
sun, making one complete revolution every 365 days.

**Q** : Why doesn’t the sun’s gravity pull Earth down to the surface of
the sun?

**A** : Earth has enough forward velocity to partly counter the force of
the sun’s gravity.

### What Is Orbital Motion? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBPcmJpdGFsIE1vdGlvbj8._18-2cd}

Earth and many other bodies—including asteroids, comets, and the other
planets—move around the sun in curved paths called orbits. Generally,
the orbits are elliptical, or oval, in shape. You can see the shape of
Earth’s orbit in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxsaXB0aWNhbE9yYml0) . Because of the
sun’s relatively strong gravity, Earth and the other bodies constantly
fall toward the sun, but they stay far enough away from the sun because
of their forward velocity to fall around the sun instead of into it. As
a result, they keep orbiting the sun and never crash to its surface. The
motion of Earth and the other bodies around the sun is called **orbital
motion** . Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward
and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object. You can
explore orbital motion and gravity in depth with the animation at this

### Orbital Motion of the Moon {#5.html#x-ck12-T3JiaXRhbCBNb3Rpb24gb2YgdGhlIE1vb24._18-nwn}

Just as Earth orbits the sun, the moon also orbits Earth. The moon is
affected by Earth’s gravity more than it is by the gravity of the sun
because the moon is much closer to Earth. The gravity between Earth and
the moon pulls the moon toward Earth. At the same time, the moon has
forward velocity that partly counters the force of Earth’s gravity. So
the moon orbits Earth instead of falling down to the surface of the
planet.

The **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT3JiaXRz) shows the forces
involved in the moon’s orbital motion around Earth. In the diagram, v
represents the forward velocity of the moon, and a represents the
acceleration due to gravity between Earth and the moon. The line
encircling Earth shows the moon’s actual orbit, which results from the
combination of v and a. You can see an animated version of this diagram

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-qjw}

-   Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at
    the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object.
-   The forward velocity of the object combines with acceleration due to
    gravity toward the other object. The result is a circular or oval
    path called an orbit, in which one object keeps moving around
    the other.
-   Because of the relatively great gravity of the sun, Earth orbits
    the sun. The moon orbits Earth rather than the sun because it is
    much closer to Earth.

1.  Which range of initial velocities for the cannon ball puts it into
    orbit?
2.  What happens to the cannon ball if its initial velocity is less than

3.  What happens to the cannon ball if its initial velocity is greater
    than this range?

### Review {#5.html#x-ck12-UmV2aWV3_18-yer}

1.  Define orbit and orbital motion, and explain why orbital
    motion occurs.
2.  In addition to the moon, artificial satellites also orbit Earth.
    What factors do you think must be taken into account to ensure that
    a satellite keeps orbiting Earth rather than falling back to Earth’s
    surface?
3.  Earth is closer to nearby planets including Venus and Mars than it
    is to the sun. Why don’t these other planets pull Earth toward them
    and cause it to veer off its orbit around the sun.

What will happen to this bungee jumper when he reaches the end of the
bungee cord? He won’t come to an abrupt stop. If he did, he might be
seriously hurt. Instead, the cord will stretch while slowing his fall.

**Q** : What will happen next?

**A** : The cord will only stretch so far, and then it will snap back to
its original shape, causing the jumper to bounce back up. Bungee cords
are useful for this purpose because they are elastic.

### Elasticity and Elastic Force {#5.html#x-ck12-RWxhc3RpY2l0eSBhbmQgRWxhc3RpYyBGb3JjZQ.._19-rb6}

Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being
stretched or compressed. This property is called **elasticity** . As you
stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists
the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite
direction. This force is called **elastic force** . The farther the
material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force
becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released,
elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape.
You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtM9JznLh8](watch?v=fFtM9JznLh8)

You can do some virtual bungee jumping at this URL:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaICwFMHcaY](watch?v=eaICwFMHcaY)

**Q** : What force stretches the bungee cord after the jumper jumps?
When does the bungee cord snap back to its original shape?

**A** : After the bungee jumper jumps, he accelerates toward the ground
due to gravity. His weight stretches the bungee cord. As the bungee cord
stretches, it exerts elastic force upward against the jumper, which
slows his descent and brings him to a momentary stop. Then the bungee
cord springs back to its original shape, and the jumper bounces upward.

### Using Elastic Force {#5.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRWxhc3RpYyBGb3JjZQ.._19-r5c}

Elastic force can be very useful and not just for bungee jumping. In
fact, you probably use elastic force every day. A few common uses of
elastic force are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxhc3RpY1N0dWZm) . Do you use elastic
force in any of these ways?

**Q** : How does the resistance band work? How does it use elastic
force?

**A** : When you pull on the band, it stretches but doesn’t break. The
resistance you feel when you pull on it is elastic force. The farther
you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. The resistance of
the band to stretching is what gives your muscles a workout. After you
stop pulling on the band, it returns to its original shape, ready for
the next stretch.

Springs like the spring toy pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2xpbmt5) also have elastic force when
they are stretched or compressed. And like stretchy materials, they
return to their original shape when the stretching or compressing force
is released. Springs are used in scales to measure weight. They also
cushion the ride in a car.

**Q** : Can you think of other uses of springs?

**A** : Bedsprings provide springy support beneath a mattress. The
spring in a door closer pulls the door shut. The spring in a retractable
ballpoint pen retracts the point of the pen. The spring in a pogo stick
bounces the rider up off the ground.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-5cy}

-   Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original
    shape after being stretched or compressed. When an elastic material
    is stretched or compressed, it exerts elastic force. This force
    increases the more the material is stretched or compressed.
-   Elastic force has many uses, from hair scrunchies to bed springs.

There’s no doubt from Corey’s face that he loves skateboarding! Corey
and his friends visit Newton’s Skate Park every chance they get. They
may not know it, but while they’re having fun on their skateboards,
they’re actually applying science concepts such as forces and motion.

### Starting and Stopping {#5.html#x-ck12-U3RhcnRpbmcgYW5kIFN0b3BwaW5n_20-qcx}

Did you ever ride a skateboard? Even if you didn’t, you probably know
that to start a skateboard rolling over a level surface, you need to
push off with one foot against the ground. That’s what Corey’s friend
Nina is doing in this picture
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2thdGVib2FyZDI.) .

Do you know how to stop a skateboard once it starts rolling? Look how
Nina's friend Laura does it in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2thdGVib2FyZDM.) . She steps down on the
back of the skateboard so it scrapes on the pavement. This creates
friction, which stops the skateboard.

Even if Laura didn’t try to stop the skateboard, it would stop sooner or
later. That’s because there’s also friction between the wheels and the
pavement. Friction is a force that counters all kinds of motion. It
occurs whenever two surfaces come into contact.

#### Video Break {#5.html#x-ck12-VmlkZW8gQnJlYWs._20_20-f3g}

### Laws of the Park: Newton’s First Law {#5.html#x-ck12-TGF3cyBvZiB0aGUgUGFyazogTmV3dG9u4oCZcyBGaXJzdCBMYXc._20-is5}

If you understand how a skateboard starts and stops, then you already
know something about **Newton’s first law of motion** . This law was
developed by English scientist Isaac Newton around 1700. Newton was one
of the greatest scientists of all time. He developed three laws of
motion and the law of gravity, among many other contributions.

**Newton’s first law of motion** states that an object at rest will
remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is
acted on by an unbalanced force. Without an unbalanced force, a moving
object will not only keep moving, but its speed and direction will also
remain the same. Newton’s first law of motion is often called the law of
inertia because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change
in its motion. If an object is already at rest, inertia will keep it at
rest. If an object is already in motion, inertia will keep it moving.

#### Do You Get It? {#5.html#x-ck12-RG8gWW91IEdldCBJdD8._20_20-dak}

**Q** : How does Nina use Newton’s first law to start her skateboard
rolling?

**A** : The skateboard won’t move unless Nina pushes off from the
pavement with one foot. The force she applies when she pushes off is
stronger than the force of friction that opposes the skateboard’s
motion. As a result, the force on the skateboard is unbalanced, and the
skateboard moves forward.

**Q** : How does Nina use Newton’s first law to stop her skateboard?

**A** : Once the skateboard starts moving, it would keep moving at the
same speed and in the same direction if not for another unbalanced
force. That force is friction between the skateboard and the pavement.
The force of friction is unbalanced because Nina is no longer pushing
with her foot to keep the skateboard moving. That’s why the skateboard
stops.

Corey’s friend Jerod likes to skate on the flat banks at Newton’s Skate
Park. That’s Jerod in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2thdGVib2FyZDU.) . As he reaches the top
of a bank, he turns his skateboard to go back down. To change direction,
he presses down with his heels on one edge of the skateboard. This
causes the skateboard to turn in the opposite direction.

**Q** : How does Jerod use Newton’s first law of motion to change the
direction of his skateboard?

**A** : Pressing down on just one side of a skateboard creates an
unbalanced force. The unbalanced force causes the skateboard to turn
toward the other side. In the picture, Jerod is pressing down with his
heels, so the skateboard turns toward his toes.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-uvl}

-   Newton’s first law of motion states that an object at rest will
    remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless
    it is acted on by an unbalanced force.
-   Using unbalanced forces to control the motion of a skateboard
    demonstrates Newton’s first law of motion.

At Newton’s Skate Park, Lauren is pushing her twin cousins, Jonathan and
Cody, on her skateboard. She has to push hard to get the skateboard
started, but once it begins moving, it takes much less effort to keep it
rolling over the smooth, flat pavement. In fact, if Lauren tries to stop
the rolling skateboard, it may take as much effort to stop it as it did
to start it rolling in the first place.

**Q** : Why is it harder to start and stop the skateboard than it is to
keep it rolling?

**A** : The reason is inertia.

### What Is Inertia? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBJbmVydGlhPw.._21-t7d}

**Inertia** is the tendency of an object to resist a change in its
motion. All objects have inertia, whether they are stationary or moving.
Inertia explains Newton’s first law of motion, which states that an
object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in
motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. That’s why Newton’s
first law of motion is sometimes called the law of inertia. You can see
an animation of inertia at this URL:

[http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/newtlaws/cci.cfm](cci.cfm)

**Q** : You probably don’t realize it, but you experience inertia all
the time, and you don’t have to ride a skateboard. For example, think
about what happens when you are riding in a car that stops suddenly.
Your body moves forward on the seat and strains against the seat belt.
Why does this happen?

**A** : The brakes stop the car but not your body, so your body keeps
moving forward because of inertia.

Inertia explains why it’s important to always wear a seat belt.

</div>

### Inertia and Mass {#5.html#x-ck12-SW5lcnRpYSBhbmQgTWFzcw.._21-hrs}

The inertia of an object depends on its mass. Objects with greater mass
also have greater inertia. It would be easier for Lauren to push just
one of her cousins on her skateboard than both of them. With just one
twin, there would be only about half as much mass on the skateboard, so
there would be less inertia to overcome.

### Overcoming Inertia {#5.html#x-ck12-T3ZlcmNvbWluZyBJbmVydGlh_21-dmy}

To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an
unbalanced force acting on the object. The unbalanced force that starts
Lauren’s cousins rolling along on the skateboard is applied by Lauren
when she gives it a push. Once an object starts moving, inertia keeps it
moving without any additional force being applied. In fact, it won’t
stop moving unless another unbalanced force opposes its motion. For
example, Lauren can stop the rolling skateboard by moving to the other
end and pushing in the opposite direction.

**Q** : What if Lauren didn’t stop the skateboard in this way? If it
remained on a smooth, flat surface, would it just keep rolling forever?

**A** : The inertia of the moving skateboard would keep it rolling
forever if no other unbalanced force opposed its motion. However,
another unbalanced force does act on the skateboard

**Q** : What other force is acting on the skateboard?

**A** : The other force is rolling friction between the skateboard’s
wheels and the ground. The force of friction opposes the motion of the
rolling skateboard and would eventually bring it to a stop without any
help from Lauren. Friction opposes the motion of all moving objects,
so—like the skateboard—all moving objects eventually stop moving even if
no other forces oppose their motion.

Later that day, Jonathan rode his skateboard and did some jumps. You can
see him in the picture
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmx5aW5nU2thdGVib2FyZGVy) . When he’s in
the air, there is no rolling friction between his wheels and the ground,
but another unbalanced force is acting on the skateboard and changing
its motion.

**Q** : What force is acting on the skateboard when it is in the air
above the ground? And how will this force change the skateboard’s
motion?

**A** : The force of gravity is acting on the skateboard. It will pull
the skateboard back down to the ground. Once it’s on the ground,
friction will slow its motion.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-7gr}

-   Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist a change in
    its motion. Because of inertia, a resting object will remain at
    rest, and a moving object will keep moving.
-   Objects with greater mass have greater inertia.
-   To change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an
    unbalanced force acting on the object.

These boys are racing around the track at Newton’s Skate Park. The boy
who can increase his speed the most will win the race. Tony, who is
closest to the camera in this picture, is bigger and stronger than the
other two boys, so he can apply greater force to his skates.

**Q** : Does this mean that Tony will win the race?

**A** : Not necessarily, because force isn’t the only factor that
affects acceleration.

### Force, Mass, and Acceleration {#5.html#x-ck12-Rm9yY2UsIE1hc3MsIGFuZCBBY2NlbGVyYXRpb24._22-aeh}

Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it
accelerates. Acceleration occurs whenever an unbalanced force acts on an
object. Two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force
acting on the object and the object’s mass. **Newton’s second law of
motion** describes how force and mass affect acceleration. The law
states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on
the object divided by the object’s mass. This can be represented by the
equation:

![\\mathrm{Acceleration=\\frac{Net\\;force}{Mass}}](ck12_math_images_dir/2523523c7dd66a4fa3b86356a31d0c91.png)

or
![\\mathrm{a=\\frac{F}{m}}](ck12_math_images_dir/333fbf4491a58bb35b621f99ddf154b1.png)

**Q** : While Tony races along on his rollerblades, what net force is
acting on the skates?

**A** : Tony exerts a backward force against the ground, as you can see
in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2thdGVzT25seQ..) ,
first with one skate and then with the other. This force pushes him
forward. Although friction partly counters the forward motion of the
skates, it is weaker than the force Tony exerts. Therefore, there is a
net forward force on the skates.

### Direct and Inverse Relationships {#5.html#x-ck12-RGlyZWN0IGFuZCBJbnZlcnNlIFJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHM._22-fyc}

Newton’s second law shows that there is a direct relationship between
force and acceleration. The greater the force that is applied to an
object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For
example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration.

The relationship between mass and acceleration is different. It is an
inverse relationship. In an inverse relationship, when one variable
increases, the other variable decreases. The greater the mass of an
object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied. For
example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much
acceleration for the same amount of force.

**Q** : Tony has greater mass than the other two boys he is racing
(pictured in the opening image). How will this affect his acceleration
around the track?

**A** : Tony’s greater mass will result in less acceleration for the
same amount of force.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-wna}

-   Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of an
    object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the
    object’s mass.
-   According to the second law, there is a direct relationship between
    force and acceleration and an inverse relationship between mass

Xander goes airborne on his scooter as he exits a half-pipe at Newton’s
Skate Park. How did he gain enough speed in the half-pipe to fly into
the air when he got to the top? His increase in speed was due partly to
the force of gravity.  

### Acceleration, Force, and Mass {#5.html#x-ck12-QWNjZWxlcmF0aW9uLCBGb3JjZSwgYW5kIE1hc3M._23-ctr}

A change in an object’s motion—such as Xander speeding up on his
scooter—is called **acceleration** . Acceleration occurs whenever an
object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. The greater the net force
acting on the object, the greater its acceleration will be, but the mass
of the object also affects its acceleration. The smaller its mass is,
the greater its acceleration for a given amount of force. Newton’s
second law of motion summarizes these relationships. According to this
law, the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on it
divided by its mass. This can be represented by the equation:

![\\mathrm{Acceleration=\\frac{Net\\;force}{Mass}}](ck12_math_images_dir/2523523c7dd66a4fa3b86356a31d0c91.png)
or
![\\mathrm{a=\\frac{F}{m}}](ck12_math_images_dir/333fbf4491a58bb35b621f99ddf154b1.png)

### Calculating Acceleration {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9u_23-jyx}

This equation for acceleration can be used to calculate the acceleration
of an object that is acted on by a net force. For example, Xander and
his scooter have a total mass of 50 kilograms. Assume that the net force
acting on Xander and the scooter is 25 Newtons. What is his
acceleration? Substitute the relevant values into the equation for
acceleration:

![\\text{a}=\\frac{\\text{F}}{\\text{m}}=\\frac{25 \\ \\text{N}}{50 \\
\\text{kg}}=\\frac{0.5 \\
\\text{N}}{\\text{kg}}](ck12_math_images_dir/aba22d5be94152657d273c4989fcd13e.png)

The Newton is the SI unit for force. It is defined as the force needed
to cause a 1-kilogram mass to accelerate at 1 m/s ^2^ . Therefore, force
can also be expressed in the unit kg • m/s ^2^ . This way of expressing
force can be substituted for Newtons in Xander’s acceleration so the
answer is expressed in the SI unit for acceleration, which is m/s ^2^ :

![\\text{a}=\\frac{0.5 \\ \\text{N}}{\\text{kg}}=\\frac{0.5 \\
\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}\^2}{\\text{kg}}=0.5 \\
\\text{m/s}\^2](ck12_math_images_dir/4175d5b9cc5f75762224760e6762cd77.png)

**Q** : Why are there no kilograms in the final answer to this problem?

**A** : The kilogram units in the numerator and denominator of the
fraction cancel out. As a result, the answer is expressed in the correct
SI units for acceleration.

### Calculating Force {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgRm9yY2U._23-yh9}

It’s often easier to measure the mass and acceleration of an object than
the net force acting on it. Mass can be measured with a balance, and
average acceleration can be calculated from velocity and time. However,
net force may be a combination of many unseen forces, such as gravity,
friction with surfaces, and air resistance. Therefore, it may be more
useful to know how to calculate the net force acting on an object from
its mass and acceleration. The equation for acceleration above can be
rewritten to solve for net force as:

Net Force = Mass × Acceleration, or

F = m × a

Look at Xander in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2tvb3Rlckp1bXA.) . He’s riding his
scooter down a ramp. Assume that his acceleration is 0.8 m/s ^2^ . How
much force does it take for him to accelerate at this rate? Substitute
the relevant values into the equation for force to find the answer:

F = m × a = 50 kg × 0.8 m/s ^2^ = 40 kg • m/s ^2^ , or 40 N

**Q** : If Xander and his scooter actually had a mass of 40 kg instead
of 50 kg, how much force would it take for him to accelerate at 0.8 m/s

This is Sam at Newton’s Skate Park. He’s standing on the back end of his
skateboard to keep it from tipping over the edge of a half-pipe. The
force of his weight pressing down on the skateboard prevents gravity
from pulling it over the edge and down the side of the half-pipe.

### Weight, Mass, and Acceleration {#5.html#x-ck12-V2VpZ2h0LCBNYXNzLCBhbmQgQWNjZWxlcmF0aW9u_24-2ei}

**Weight** is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an
object. It depends on the object’s mass, which is how much matter the
object contains. It also depends on the downward acceleration of the
object due to gravity, which is the same all over Earth. Weight can be
represented by the equation:

F = m × a

This is the general equation that relates force to mass and
acceleration. When it relates weight to mass and acceleration, the
letter F represents the object’s weight in Newtons (N), which is the SI
unit for weight. The letter m in the equation represents the object’s
mass in kilograms, and the letter a represents the downward acceleration
due to gravity. As this equation shows, weight is directly related to
mass. As an object’s mass increases, so does its weight. For example, if
mass doubles, weight doubles as well. You can learn more about weight,
mass, and acceleration at this URL:

[http://www.nasa.gov/mov/192448main\_018\_force\_equals\_mass\_time.mov](192448main_018_force_equals_mass_time.mov)

### Calculating Weight {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgV2VpZ2h0_24-n4a}

All objects on Earth accelerate downward due to gravity at a rate of 9.8
m/s ^2^ . Therefore, if you know the mass of an object, you can
calculate its weight using this equation:

F = m × 9.8 m/s ^2^

**Q** : Sam has a mass of 50 kilograms. What is his weight in Newtons?

**A** : You can calculate Sam’s weight in Newtons by substituting his
mass in kilograms into the weight formula:

F = m × 9.8 m/s ^2^ = 50 kg × 9.8 m/s ^2^ = 490 kg \*bull; m/s ^2^ , or
490 N

You’re probably more familiar with weight in pounds (lb) than in
Newtons. One Newton equals 0.225 pounds. In other words, there are 0.225
pounds per Newton. You can use this ratio to convert Newtons to pounds.

**Q** : What is Sam’s weight in pounds?

**A** : In pounds, Sam’s weight is 490 N x 0.225 lb/N = 110 lb.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-tlh}

-   Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on
    an object. It depends on the object’s mass and the acceleration due
    to gravity, which is 9.8 m/s ^2^ on Earth.
-   The formula for calculating weight is F = m × 9.8 m/s ^2^ , where F
    is the object’s weight in Newtons (N) and m is the object’s mass
    in kilograms. The Newton is the SI unit for weight, and 1 Newton
    equals 0.225 pounds.

This is a sketch of Jerod on his skateboard. He’s on his way to Newton’s
Skate Park. When he pushes his foot against the ground, what happens
next? He moves on his skateboard in the opposite direction. How does
this happen?

### Action and Reaction {#5.html#x-ck12-QWN0aW9uIGFuZCBSZWFjdGlvbg.._25-ax9}

**Newton’s third law of motion** explains how Jerod starts his
skateboard moving. This law states that every action has an equal and
opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs. First an
action occurs—Jerod pushes against the ground with his foot. Then a
reaction occurs—Jerod moves forward on his skateboard. The reaction is
always equal in strength to the action but in the opposite direction.

**Q** : If Jerod pushes against the ground with greater force, how will
this affect his forward motion?

**A** : His action force will be greater, so the reaction force will be
greater as well. Jerod will be pushed forward with more force, and this
will make him go faster and farther.

### Equal and Opposite Forces {#5.html#x-ck12-RXF1YWwgYW5kIE9wcG9zaXRlIEZvcmNlcw.._25-fy4}

arrows. The way an arrow points shows the direction of the force, and
the size of the arrow represents the strength of the force. Look at the
skateboarders in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRm9yY2Vz)
. In the top row, the arrows represent the forces with which the
skateboarders push against each other. This is the action. In the bottom
row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders move
apart. This is the reaction. Compare the top and bottom arrows. They
point in different directions, but they are the same size. This shows
that the reaction forces are equal and opposite to the action forces.

### Equal and Opposite but Not Balanced {#5.html#x-ck12-RXF1YWwgYW5kIE9wcG9zaXRlIGJ1dCBOb3QgQmFsYW5jZWQ._25-yg5}

Because action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, you might
think they would cancel out, as balanced forces do. But you would be
wrong. Balanced forces are equal and opposite forces that act on the
same object. That’s why they cancel out. Action-reaction forces are
equal and opposite forces that act on different objects, so they don’t
cancel out. In fact, they often result in motion. Think about Jerod
again. He applies force with his foot to the ground, whereas the ground
applies force to Jerod and the skateboard, causing them to move forward.

**Q** : Actions and reactions occur all the time. Can you think of an
example in your daily life?

**A** : Here’s one example. If you lean on something like a wall or your
locker, you are applying force to it. The wall or locker applies an
equal and opposite force to you. If it didn’t, you would go right
through it or else it would tip over.

You can watch a video about actions and reactions at this URL:

[http://www.nasa.gov/mov/192449main\_019\_law\_of\_action.mov](192449main_019_law_of_action.mov)

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-vk7}

-   Newton’s third law of motion states that every action has an equal
    and opposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs.
-   Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, but they are not
    balanced forces because they act on different objects so they don’t
    cancel out.

Cody seems a little reluctant to launch himself down this ramp at
Newton’s Skate Park. It will be his first time down the ramp, and he
knows from watching his older brother Jerod that he’ll be moving fast by
the time he gets to the bottom. The faster he goes, the harder it will
be to stop. That’s because of momentum.  

### What Is Momentum? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBNb21lbnR1bT8._26-gks}

**Momentum** is a property of a moving object that makes it hard to
stop. The more mass it has or the faster it’s moving, the greater its
momentum. Momentum equals mass times velocity and is represented by the
equation:

Momentum = Mass × Velocity

**Q** : What is Cody’s momentum as he stands at the top of the ramp?

**A** : Cody has no momentum as he stands there because he isn’t moving.
In other words, his velocity is zero. However, Cody will gain momentum
as he starts moving down the ramp and picks up speed.

**Q** : Cody’s older brother Jerod is pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSnVtcA..) . If Jerod were to travel down
the ramp at the same velocity as Cody, who would have greater momentum?
Who would be harder to stop?

**A** : Jerod obviously has greater mass than Cody, so he would have
greater momentum. He would also be harder to stop.

### Calculating Momentum {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgTW9tZW50dW0._26-lhj}

To calculate momentum with the equation above, mass is measured in (kg),
and velocity is measured in meters per second (m/s). For example, Cody
and his skateboard have a combined mass of 40 kg. If Cody is traveling
at a velocity of 1.1 m/s by the time he reaches the bottom of the ramp,
then his momentum is:

Momentum = 40 kg × 1.1 m/s = 44 kg • m/s

Note that the SI unit for momentum is kg • m/s.

**Q** : The combined mass of Jerod and his skateboard is 68 kg. If Jerod
goes down the ramp at the same velocity as Cody, what is his momentum at
the bottom of the ramp?

**A** : His momentum is:

Momentum = 68 kg × 1.1 m/s = 75 kg • m/s

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-bku}

-   Momentum is a property of a moving object that makes it hard
    to stop. It equals the object’s mass times its velocity.
-   To calculate the momentum of a moving object, multiply its mass in
    kilograms (kg) by its velocity in meters per second (m/s). The SI
    unit of momentum is kg • m/s.

These skaters are racing each other at Newton’s Skate Park. The first
skater in line, the one on the left, is distracted by something he sees.
He starts to slow down without realizing it. The skater behind him isn’t
paying attention and keeps skating at the same speed.

**Q** : Can you guess what happens next?

**A** : Skater 2 runs into skater 1.

### Conserving Momentum {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmluZyBNb21lbnR1bQ.._27-f3q}

When skater 2 runs into skater 1, he’s going faster than skater 1 so he
has more momentum. **Momentum** is a property of a moving object that
makes it hard to stop. It’s a product of the object’s mass and velocity.
At the moment of the collision, skater 2 transfers some of his momentum
to skater 1, who shoots forward when skater 2 runs into him. Whenever an
action and reaction such as this occur, momentum is transferred from one
object to the other. However, the combined momentum of the objects
remains the same. In other words, momentum is conserved. This is the
**law of conservation of momentum** .

### Modeling Momentum {#5.html#x-ck12-TW9kZWxpbmcgTW9tZW50dW0._27-e32}

The **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVzaA..) shows how
momentum is conserved in the two colliding skaters. The total momentum
is the same after the collision as it was before. However, after the
collision, skater 1 has more momentum and skater 2 has less momentum
than before.

Did you ever use a bicycle pump like the one seen in the opening image?
When you push down on the handle, it forces air out through the hose,
and the air enters the tire through a tiny opening. Like other
**fluids** (liquids and gases), air can flow and take the shape of its
container. The air that enters the tire from the pump quickly spreads
out to fill the entire tire evenly. As the tire fills with air, it feels
firmer. That’s because the air exerts pressure against the inside
surface of the tire.

### Why Fluids Exert Pressure {#5.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEZsdWlkcyBFeGVydCBQcmVzc3VyZQ.._28-zyt}

All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of
fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the
particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else
in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is
exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together
in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first
entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available
space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of
higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air
entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.

### Pressure, Force, and Area {#5.html#x-ck12-UHJlc3N1cmUsIEZvcmNlLCBhbmQgQXJlYQ.._28-fn1}

**Pressure** is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area.
Therefore, pressure can be represented by this equation:

![\\mathrm{Pressure=\\frac{Force}{Area}}](ck12_math_images_dir/f12569fb5eb8de45a5b16f2c61c4cda3.png)

**Pressure** shows how concentrated the force is on a given area. The
smaller the area to which force is applied, the greater the pressure is.
Think about pressing a pushpin, like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVzaHBpbg..) , into a bulletin board.
You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin.
However, the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts
only over the tiny point of the pin. This is a much smaller area, so the
pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than
the pressure you apply with your thumb. As a result, the pin penetrates
the bulletin board with ease.

### SI Unit for Pressure {#5.html#x-ck12-U0kgVW5pdCBmb3IgUHJlc3N1cmU._28-bag}

In the above equation for pressure, force is expressed in Newtons (N)
and area is expressed in square meters (m ^2^ ). Therefore, pressure is
expressed in N/m ^2^ , which is the SI unit for pressure. This unit is
also called the **Pascal (Pa)** . It is named for the scientist Blaise
Pascal whose discoveries about pressure in fluids led to a law of the
same name. Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal (kPa), which
equals 1000 Pascals. For example, the correct air pressure inside a
mountain bike tire is usually about 200 kPa.

### Calculating Pressure or Force {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgUHJlc3N1cmUgb3IgRm9yY2U._28-h6i}

When you know how much force is acting on a given area, you can
calculate the pressure that is being applied to the area using the
equation for pressure given above. For example, assume that a rock
weighs 5000 N and is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m ^2^ . The
pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is:

![\\text{Pressure}=\\frac{5000 \\ \\text{N}}{0.5 \\ \\text{m}\^2}=10000
\\ \\text{N/m}\^2=10000 \\ \\text{Pa, or } 10 \\
\\text{kPa}](ck12_math_images_dir/0b72c37891e522df5094238420b2f040.png)

Sometimes pressure but not force is known. To calculate force, the
equation for pressure can be rewritten as:

Force = Pressure × Area

For example, suppose another rock exerts 10 kPa of pressure over an area
of 0.4 m ^2^ . How much does the rock weigh? Change 10 kPa (10,000 Pa)
to 10,000 N/m ^2^ . Then substitute this value for pressure in the force
equation as follows:

Force (Weight) = 10,000 N/m ^2^ × 0.4 m ^2^ = 4,000 N

**Q** : The break-dancer in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQkJveQ..) has a weight of 800 N. He is
balancing on the palm of one hand. If the palm of his hand has an area
of 0.02 m ^2^ , how much pressure is he exerting on the ground?

**A** : Use the equation for pressure:

![\\text{Pressure}=\\frac{800 \\ \\text{N}}{0.02 \\ \\text{m}\^2} =
40000 \\ \\text{Pa, or } 40 \\

### Factors That Affect Fluid Pressure {#5.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEFmZmVjdCBGbHVpZCBQcmVzc3VyZQ.._28-wtb}

Two factors influence the pressure of fluids. They are the depth of the
fluid and its density.

-   A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths. Deeper in a fluid,
    all of the fluid above it results in more weight pressing down. This
    causes greater pressure the deeper you go. You can watch a video
    demonstration of depth and fluid pressure at this URL:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUK7agBG4KA](watch?v=oUK7agBG4KA)

[![](ck12_5_files/tmpoXM3FS.jpeg)](oUK7agBG4KA%3Fwmode%3Dtransparent%26rel%3D0%26hash%3Db922ce37064a9fb726aa7b245ebbe364)

Click on the image above for more content

-   Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense
    fluids such as air. The particles of denser fluids are closer
    together, so there are more collisions of particles in a given area.
    The difference in density of water and air is illustrated in the
    **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGFydGljbGVz) .

In 2012, the film director James Cameron, who directed the film Titanic,
made headlines when he traveled to Challenger Deep. This is the deepest
known point on the ocean floor, almost 11,000 meters below the surface.
Cameron was the first person to travel there alone, and he made the trip
in a deep-sea diving vehicle named Deepsea Challenger. The vehicle
pictured above is another deep-sea diving vehicle, named Alvin. Alvin is
no longer used for ocean exploration, but by the time it was retired, it
had made thousands of dives. Alvin was even used to explore the Titanic
on the North Atlantic Ocean floor.

**Q** : Why must divers use special diving machines such as Alvin and
Deepsea Challenger to go deep below the surface of the ocean? Why can’t
they just use scuba diving gear?

**A** : The pressure of the water is too great that far below the
surface. It would crush divers long before they could reach the bottom.

### Water Pressure and Depth {#5.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgUHJlc3N1cmUgYW5kIERlcHRo_29-vde}

**Pressure** is the amount of force acting on a given area. As you go
deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases
steadily. That’s because there is more and more water pressing down on
you from above. The **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2xpZmY.)
shows how pressure changes with depth. For each additional meter below
the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa. At 30 meters below the
surface, the pressure is double the pressure at the surface. At a depth
greater than 500 meters, the pressure is too great for humans to
withstand without special equipment to protect them. At nearly 11,000
meters below the surface, the pressure is tremendous. You can see a
video showing changes in water pressure with increasing depth at this

### Adjusting to Changing Pressure {#5.html#x-ck12-QWRqdXN0aW5nIHRvIENoYW5naW5nIFByZXNzdXJl_29-jl2}

Scuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they don’t go
very deep below the surface of the water. Nonetheless, because of the
pressure of the water, scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters
must return to the surface slowly. They must stop for several minutes at
one or more points in their ascent. That’s what the divers in the
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2N1YmE.) are doing. The stops
are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the
decreasing pressure of the water as they swim closer to the surface. If
they were to rise to the surface too quickly, the gases dissolved in
their blood would form bubbles and cause serious health problems.

**Q** : Why would dissolved gases form bubbles as pressure decreases?

**A** : Less gas can dissolve in a fluid at lower pressure. Therefore,
as pressure decreases, gases come out of solution and form bubbles.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-htv}

-   As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the
    water increases. For each additional meter below the surface,
    pressure increases by 10 kPa.
-   Water pressure makes it difficult to explore the deep ocean. The
    pressure is too great for divers unless they travel in
    pressure-resistant deep-sea vehicles. Even scuba divers have to take
    time to adjust to the changes in pressure as they return to
    the surface.

Rays of sunlight pour into this old room and reflect off dust particles
in the air. Did you ever see dust particles in the air like these? If
so, you may have noticed that they constantly move about at random.

**Q** : Why do dust particles move randomly in the air?

**A** : Invisible particles of gases in the air are constantly moving
and bumping into them.

### Pressure of Gas Particles {#5.html#x-ck12-UHJlc3N1cmUgb2YgR2FzIFBhcnRpY2xlcw.._30-0pl}

Because gas particles in the air—like particles of all fluids—are
constantly moving and bumping into things, they exert **pressure** . The
pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to
Earth’s surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface. You
can see this in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnQ.)
.

**Q** : Denver, Colorado, is called the “mile-high city” because it is
located 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level. What is the average atmospheric
pressure that high above sea level?

**A** : From the **Figure** [above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnQ.) ,
the average atmospheric pressure 1.6 km above sea level is about 85 kPa.

### Explaining Changes in Air Pressure with Altitude {#5.html#x-ck12-RXhwbGFpbmluZyBDaGFuZ2VzIGluIEFpciBQcmVzc3VyZSB3aXRoIEFsdGl0dWRl_30-thd}

There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases:
density and depth of the atmosphere.

-   Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s
    surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser near the surface.
    With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions
    of particles and therefore greater pressure.
-   The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is
    greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes. With
    greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down
    from above. Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and
    falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is
    the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third
    of the pressure at sea level.

### How We Use Air Pressure {#5.html#x-ck12-SG93IFdlIFVzZSBBaXIgUHJlc3N1cmU._30-ujd}

The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from
sipping through a straw to simply breathing. You can see in the
**Figures** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RyYXc.) and
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVzcGlyYXRpb24.) how we use air pressure
in both of these ways.

**Figure 5.60**

When you first suck on a straw, you remove air from the straw, so the
air pressure in the straw is lower that the air pressure on the surface
of the drink. A fluid always flows from an area of higher pressure to an
area of lower pressure, so the drink moves up the straw and into your
mouth.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-oav}

-   The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greatest at
    Earth’s surface and falls as altitude increases. The reason is that
    density and depth of the atmosphere are greatest at sea level and
    decline with increasing altitude.
-   The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things,

Did you ever watch someone make balloon animals like this turkey? When
you blow up a balloon, you force air inside the balloon through a small
opening. The air spreads out and presses against the inside of the
balloon, forcing it to expand. Pressure always spreads throughout a
contained fluid like air in a balloon.

### Pressure and Force {#5.html#x-ck12-UHJlc3N1cmUgYW5kIEZvcmNl_31-z8t}

**Pressure** is the amount of force acting on a given area. It is
represented by the equation:

![\\mathrm{Pressure=\\frac{Force}{Area}}](ck12_math_images_dir/f12569fb5eb8de45a5b16f2c61c4cda3.png)

The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if
the same force is applied over a smaller area. The equation for pressure
can be rewritten as:

Force = Pressure × Area

This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area
increases the force.

### Pascal and His Law {#5.html#x-ck12-UGFzY2FsIGFuZCBIaXMgTGF3_31-5p3}

Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was
conducted by a French mathematician and physicist named Blaise Pascal
(1623–1662). The SI unit of pressure, the Pascal (Pa), is named for him
because of his important research. One of Pascal’s major contributions
is known as **Pascal’s law** . This law states that a change in pressure
at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the
fluid. To see a video about Pascal’s law, go to this URL:

### A Simple Example {#5.html#x-ck12-QSBTaW1wbGUgRXhhbXBsZQ.._31-vmz}

A simple example may help you understand Pascal’s law. Toothpaste is a
fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end. Look
at the toothpaste tube in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVG9vdGhwYXN0ZQ..) . When any part of the
tube is squeezed, toothpaste squirts out the open end. The pressure
applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste.
When the pressure reaches the open end, it forces toothpaste out through
the opening.

### Using Fluid Pressure {#5.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRmx1aWQgUHJlc3N1cmU._31-uqr}

The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very
useful—besides getting toothpaste out of a tube! For example, hydraulic
brakes in a car use fluid to transmit pressure, and when they do, they
also increase force. You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQnJha2U.) .

Hydraulic Brakes

</div>

**Q** : In this diagram, how can you tell that the force applied by the
brake cylinder is greater than the force applied by the brake pedal
mechanism?

**A** : The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder
are larger than the arrow representing the force applied by the brake
pedal mechanism. A larger arrow indicates greater force.

**Q** : How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to
the brake shoes?

**A** : The pressure exerted by the fluid on the brake shoes is applied
over a larger area. When pressure acts over a larger area, it increases
the force (Force = Pressure × Area).

Hydraulic car lifts also use fluid to transmit pressure and increase
force. The lifts are used to raise cars, which are very heavy, so
mechanics can work on them from underneath. Controls in airplanes use
fluids to transmit pressure and increase force so a flick of a switch
can raise or lower heavy landing gear. To see animations of hydraulic
systems such as these, go to URLs:

Look at the large bar (labeled “TELMEX”) across the back of this
racecar. The bar is called a spoiler. It causes air pressure to push the
car toward the ground. This increases friction between the wheels and
the pavement, helping the car to hug the track. How does a spoiler work?
Bernoulli’s law has the answer.

### What Is Bernoulli’s Law? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBCZXJub3VsbGnigJlzIExhdz8._32-rwi}

**Bernoulli’s law** states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as
air is less when the fluid is moving faster. Pressure is the amount of
force applied per given area. The law is named for Daniel Bernoulli, a
Swiss mathematician who discovered it during the 1700s. Bernoulli used
mathematics to arrive at his law. For an animation of the law, go to the

### Using Air Pressure to Fly {#5.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgQWlyIFByZXNzdXJlIHRvIEZseQ.._32-1ug}

Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes or birds allow them to
fly? Bernoulli’s law provides the answer. Look at the wings of the plane
and hawk in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmx5) . The
shape of the wings causes air to flow more slowly below them than above
them. This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above
them. The difference in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the
ground.

**Q** : How does a spoiler on a racecar use Bernoulli’s law?

**A** : A spoiler on a racecar is like an upside-down wing. Its shape
causes air to flow more slowly—and air pressure to be greater—above the
spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car
downward, helping it to stay on the track.

**Buoyant force** is an upward force that fluids exert on any object
that is placed in them. The ability of fluids to exert this force is
called **buoyancy** . What explains buoyant force? A fluid exerts
pressure in all directions, but the pressure is greater at greater
depth. Therefore, the fluid below an object, where the fluid is deeper,
exerts greater pressure on the object than the fluid above it. You can
see in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmx1aWRQcmVzc3VyZQ..) how this works.
Buoyant force explains why the girl pictured above can float in water.

**Q** : You’ve probably noticed that some things don’t float in water.
For example, if you drop a stone in water, it will sink to the bottom
rather than floating. If buoyant force applies to all objects in fluids,
why do some objects sink instead of float?

**A** : The answer has to do with their weight.

### Weight and Buoyant Force {#5.html#x-ck12-V2VpZ2h0IGFuZCBCdW95YW50IEZvcmNl_33-a23}

Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object,
whereas buoyant force pushes up on an object. Which force is greater
determines whether an object sinks or floats. Look at the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmxvYXRTaW5r) . On the left, the object’s
weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on it, so the object
floats. On the right, the object’s weight is greater than the buoyant
force acting on it, so the object sinks.

**Figure 5.67**

</div>

Because of buoyant force, objects seem lighter in water. You may have
noticed this when you went swimming and could easily pick up a friend or
sibling under the water. Some of the person’s weight was countered by
the buoyant force of the water.

### Density and Buoyant Force {#5.html#x-ck12-RGVuc2l0eSBhbmQgQnVveWFudCBGb3JjZQ.._33-olj}

Density, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to the
ability of an object to float. That’s because density affects weight. A
given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a
less dense substance. For example, ice is less dense than liquid water.
This explains why the giant ice berg in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSWNlYmVyZw..) is floating in the ocean.
You can see other examples of density and buoyant force at this URL:

**Q** : Can you think of more examples of substances that float in a
fluid because they are low in density?

**A** : Oil is less dense than water, so oil from a spill floats on
ocean water. Helium is less dense than air, so balloons filled with
helium float in air.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-edh}

-   Buoyant force is an upward force that fluids exert on any object
    that is placed in them. Buoyant force occurs because the fluid below
    an object exerts greater pressure on the object than the fluid
    above it.
-   If an object’s weight is less than the buoyant force acting on it,
    then the object floats. If an object’s weight is greater than the
    buoyant force acting on it, then the object sinks.
-   A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume
    of a less dense substance. Therefore, density of an object also
    affects whether it sinks or floats.

Do you see the man sitting on top of this tanker truck? He gives you a
sense of how big the truck is. What’s behind the truck? Is it a huge
apartment complex? It’s just as massive as a very large building, but
it’s not even resting on land. It’s a giant cruise ship, and it’s
floating on water. The ship weighs about 100,000 metric tons. How can
such a tremendous weight float on water? Why doesn’t it sink to the
bottom of the ocean instead? Archimedes’ law explains why.

### Archimedes Takes a Bath {#5.html#x-ck12-QXJjaGltZWRlcyBUYWtlcyBhIEJhdGg._34-klf}

Did you ever notice when you get into a bathtub of water that the level
of the water rises? More than 2000 years ago, a Greek mathematician
named Archimedes noticed the same thing. He observed that both a body
and the water in a tub can’t occupy the same space at the same time. As
a result, some of the water is displaced, or moved out of the way. How
much water is displaced? Archimedes determined that the volume of
displaced water equals the volume of the submerged object. So more water
is displaced by a bigger body than a smaller one.

**Q** : If you jump into swimming pool, how much water does your body
displace?

**A** : The water displaced by your body is equal to your body’s volume.
Depending on your size, this volume might be about 0.07 m ^3^ .

### Displacement and Buoyant Force {#5.html#x-ck12-RGlzcGxhY2VtZW50IGFuZCBCdW95YW50IEZvcmNl_34-fkv}

Objects such as ships may float in a fluid like water because of buoyant
force. This is an upward force that a fluid exerts on any object that is
placed in it. Archimedes discovered that the buoyant force acting on an
object equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is
known as **Archimedes’ law** (or Archimedes’ principle). For an
entertaining video presentation of Archimedes’ law, go to this URL:

### Floating Objects and Archimedes’ Law {#5.html#x-ck12-RmxvYXRpbmcgT2JqZWN0cyBhbmQgQXJjaGltZWRlc-KAmSBMYXc._34-dxy}

Archimedes’ law explains why some objects float in fluids even though
they are very heavy. It all depends on how much fluid they displace. The
cruise ship pictured in the opening image is extremely heavy, yet it
stays afloat. If a steel ball with the same weight as the ship were
placed in water, it would sink to the bottom. This is modeled in the
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQXJjaGltZWRlc0xhdw..) . The
reason the ball sinks is that its shape is very compact, so it displaces
relatively little water. The volume of water displaced by the steel ball
weighs less than the ball itself, so the buoyant force is not as great
as the force of gravity pulling down on the ball. Thus, the ball sinks.

**Figure 5.69**

</div>

Now look at the ship’s hull in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQXJjaGltZWRlc0xhdw..) . Its shape causes
the ship to displace much more water than the ball. In fact, the weight
of the displaced water is greater than the weight of the ship. As a
result, the buoyant force is greater than the force of gravity acting on
the ship, so the ship floats.

**Q** : Why might you be more likely to float in water if you stretch
out your body rather than curl up into a ball?

**A** : You would displace more water by stretching out your body, so
there would be more buoyant force acting on it. Therefore, you would be
more likely to float in this position.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._34-tr0}

-   Archimedes determined that an object displaces the same volume of
    fluid as its own volume.
-   According to Archimedes’ law, the buoyant force acting on an object
    equals the weight of the fluid that the object displaces.
-   The shape of an object may affect how much fluid it displaces and
    therefore the buoyant force acting on it. This explains why one
    object may sink while another object with the same weight but a
    different shape may float.

The teens in the picture on the left are having fun playing basketball.
The teen in the picture on the right is working hard studying for an
exam. It’s obvious who is doing work—or is it? Would it surprise you to
learn that the teens who are working are the ones who are having fun
playing basketball, while the teen who is studying isn’t doing any work
at all? The reason why has to do with how work is defined in physics.

### Defining Work {#5.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgV29yaw.._35-jlf}

Work is defined differently in physics than in everyday language. In
physics, **work** means the use of force to move an object. The teens
who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move
their bodies and the basketball, so they are doing work. The teen who is
studying isn’t moving anything, so she isn’t doing work. Not all force
that is used to move an object does work. For work to be done, the force
must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. If a force
is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is
done. The **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW92ZXI.)
illustrates this point.

**Q** : If the box the man is carrying is very heavy, does he do any
work as he walks across the room with it?

**A** : Regardless of the weight of the box, the man does no work on it
as he holds it while walking across the room. However, he does more work
when he first lifts a heavier box to chest height.

### Work, Force, and Distance {#5.html#x-ck12-V29yaywgRm9yY2UsIGFuZCBEaXN0YW5jZQ.._35-i8y}

Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the
distance the object moves. It can be represented by the equation:

Work = Force × Distance

This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an
object or the farther the object is moved, the more work that is done.
You can see a short video introduction to work as the product of force
and distance at this link:

lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight, but the one
on the bottom is lifting the weight a greater distance. Therefore, this
weight lifter is doing more work. The two weight lifters on the bottom
right are both lifting the weight the same distance, but the weight
lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight, so she is doing more
work.

Clarissa is cutting the grass in her grandmother’s yard using an
old-fashioned push mower. The mower has no motor, so Clarissa is doing
all the work. How much work does Clarissa do pushing the mower around
the yard? The amount of work depends on how much force she uses and how
far she pushes the mower.

### Work, Force, and Distance {#5.html#x-ck12-V29yaywgRm9yY2UsIGFuZCBEaXN0YW5jZQ.._36-zh7}

**Work** is the use of force to move an object. It is directly related
to both the force applied to the object and the distance the object
moves. Work can be calculated with this equation:

Work = Force x Distance.

### How Much Work? {#5.html#x-ck12-SG93IE11Y2ggV29yaz8._36-7xg}

The equation for work can be used to calculate work if force and
distance are known. To use the equation, force is expressed in Newtons
(N), and distance is expressed in meters (m). For example, assume that
Clarissa uses 100 Newtons of force to push the mower and that she pushes
it for a total of 200 meters as she cuts the grass in her grandmother’s
yard. Then, the amount of work Clarissa does is:

Work = 100 N × 200 m = 20,000 N • m

Notice that the unit for work in the answer is the Newton • meter (N •
m). This is the SI unit for work, also called the **joule (J)** . One
joule equals the amount of work that is done when 1 N of force moves an
object over a distance of 1 m.

**Q** : After Clarissa mows her grandmother’s lawn, she volunteers to
mow a neighbor’s lawn as well. If she pushes the mower with the same
force as before and moves it over a total of 234 meters, how much work
does she do mowing the neighbor’s lawn?

**A** : The work Clarissa does can be calculated as:

Work = 100 N × 234 m = 23,400 N • m, or 23,400 J

### Calculating Force or Distance When Work Is Known {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgRm9yY2Ugb3IgRGlzdGFuY2UgV2hlbiBXb3JrIElzIEtub3du_36-9nq}

The work equation given above can be rearranged to find force or
distance if the other variables are known:

![\\mathrm{Force=\\frac{Work}{Distance}}](ck12_math_images_dir/7f0c69895e3b4968abf1fd3e3b7ad61c.png)

![\\mathrm{Distance=\\frac{Work}{Force}}](ck12_math_images_dir/1f35de99f84c985ddda93d319bacc89a.png)

After Clarissa finishes mowing both lawns, she pushes the lawn mower
down the sidewalk to her own house. If she pushes the mower over a
distance of 30 meters and does 2700 joules of work, how much force does
she use? Substitute the known values into the equation for force:

![\\text{Force}=\\frac{2700 \\ \\text{J}}{30 \\ \\text{m}}=90 \\
\\text{N}](ck12_math_images_dir/aa6af797bffe2753520718c29f5996a8.png)

**Q** : When Clarissa gets back to her house, she hangs the 200-Newton
lawn mower on some hooks in the garage (see the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGFuZ2luZ01vd2Vy) ). To lift the mower,
she does 400 joules of work. How far does she lift the mower to hang it?

Did you ever sweep a floor with a broom, like the woman in the picture
on the left? It can take a lot of effort to do the job. But if you use
an electric vacuum cleaner, like the woman in the picture on the right,
you can do the same work more easily and quickly. That’s because the
vacuum cleaner provides more power.

### What Is Power? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBQb3dlcj8._37-wuc}

**Power** is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given
amount of time. Power can be represented by the equation:

![\\mathrm{Power=\\frac{Work}{Time}}](ck12_math_images_dir/1c78d22d8c9e899f12409b685fc211ba.png)

In this equation, work is measured in joules (J) and time is measured in
seconds (s), so power is expressed in joules per second (J/s). This is
the SI unit for power, also known as the **watt (W)** . A watt equals 1
joule of work per second. You’re probably already familiar with watts.
Light bulbs and small appliances such as microwave ovens are labeled
with the watts of power they provide. For example, the package of light
bulbs in the **Figure**

**Q** : Assume you have two light bulbs of the same type, such as two
compact fluorescent light bulbs like the one pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGlnaHRidWxiLVBvd2Vy) . If one light bulb
is a 25-watt bulb and the other is a 60-watt bulb, which bulb produces
brighter light?

**A** : The 60-watt bulb is more powerful, so it produces brighter
light.

Compared with a less powerful device, a more powerful device can either
do more work in the same time or do the same work in less time. For
example, compared with a low-power microwave oven, a high-power
microwave oven can cook more food in the same time or the same amount of
food in less time.

### Calculating Power from Work and Time {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgUG93ZXIgZnJvbSBXb3JrIGFuZCBUaW1l_37-1bn}

Power can be calculated using the formula above if the amount of work
and time are known. For example, assume that a microwave oven does
24,000 joules of work in 30 seconds. Then the power of the microwave is:

![\\text{Power}=\\frac{\\text{Work}}{\\text{Time}}=\\frac{24000 \\
\\text{J}}{30 \\ \\text{s}}=800 \\ \\text{J/s, or } 800 \\
\\text{W}](ck12_math_images_dir/46f1943c26523f6cbe116424a2d46e48.png)

**Q** : Another microwave oven does 5,000 joules of work in 5 seconds.
What is its power?

**A** : The power of the other microwave oven is:

![\\text{Power}=\\frac{5000 \\ \\text{J}}{5 \\ \\text{s}}=1000 \\
\\text{J/s, or } 1000 \\
\\text{W}](ck12_math_images_dir/643432d3ad5fce30766c31f2238c44b6.png)

**Q** : Which microwave oven will heat the same amount of food in less
time?

**A** : The 1000-watt microwave oven has more power, so it will heat the
same amount of food in less time.

### Calculating Work from Power and Time {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgV29yayBmcm9tIFBvd2VyIGFuZCBUaW1l_37-ewj}

You can also calculate work if you know power and time by rewriting the
power equation above as:

Work = Power × Time

For example, if you use a 1000-watt microwave oven for 20 seconds, how
much work does it do? First express 1000 watts in J/s and then
substitute this value for power the work equation:

Work = 1000 J/s × 20 s = 20,000 J

### Horsepower {#5.html#x-ck12-SG9yc2Vwb3dlcg.._37-ajt}

Sometimes power is measured in a unit called the horsepower. For
example, the power of car engines is usually expressed in horsepowers.
One horsepower is the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute. It
equals 745 watts of power. Compare the horsepowers in the **Figure**

This big tractor provides 180 horsepowers of power.

</div>

**Q** : If the team of horses and the tractor do the same amount of work
plowing a field, which will get the job done faster?

**A** : The tractor will get the job done faster because it has more
power. In fact, because the tractor has 30 times the power of the
six-horse team, ideally it can do the same work 30 times faster!

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._37-8mh}

-   Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given
    amount of time. Power equals work (J) divided by time (s).
-   The SI unit for power is the watt (W), which equals 1 joule of work
    per second (J/s).
-   Power can be calculated from work and time using the equation: .
-   Power may be measured in a unit called the horsepower. One
    horsepower is the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute, which
    equals 745 watts of power.

When you hear the word *machine* , do you think of power tools or
construction equipment, like the ones pictured above? While both of
these examples are machines, you might be surprised to learn that
devices as simple as hammers and screws are also machines.

**Q** : Why are simple tools considered to be machines?

**A** : Like all machines, they change forces and make work easier.

### What Is a Machine? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIE1hY2hpbmU__38-ors}

A **machine** is any device that makes work easier by changing a force.
Work is done whenever a force moves an object over a distance. The
amount of work done is represented by the equation:

Work = Force x Distance

When you use a machine, you apply force to the machine. This force is
called the input force. The machine, in turn, applies force to an
object. This force is called the output force. The output force may or
may not be the same as the input force. The force you apply to the
machine is applied over a given distance, called the input distance. The
force applied by the machine to the object is also applied over a
distance, called the output distance. The output distance may or may not
be the same as the input distance.  

### How Machines Make Work Easier {#5.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1hY2hpbmVzIE1ha2UgV29yayBFYXNpZXI._38-ak8}

Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work
that is done. They just change how the work is done. Machines make work
easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the
distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in
which the force is applied. For a humorous introduction to machines and
how they make work easier, watch video chapters 1–3 at the following
URL:

[http://schoolmediainteractive.com/view/object/clip/B658CEF884C8088A6B48EAA7DDA81CB8](B658CEF884C8088A6B48EAA7DDA81CB8)

**Q** : If a machine increases the force applied, what does this tell
you about the distance over which the force is applied by the machine:

**A** : The machine must apply the force over a shorter distance. That’s
because a machine doesn’t change the amount of work and work equals
force times distance. Therefore, if force increases, distance must
decrease. For the same reason, if a machine increases the distance over
which the force is applied, it must apply less force.

### Increasing Force {#5.html#x-ck12-SW5jcmVhc2luZyBGb3JjZQ.._38-ykb}

Examples of machines that increase force are steering wheels and pliers
(see **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2hlZWwtUGxpZXJz) ). Read
below to find out how both of these machines work. In each case, the
machine applies more force than the user applies to the machine, but the
machine applies the force over a shorter distance.

### Increasing Distance {#5.html#x-ck12-SW5jcmVhc2luZyBEaXN0YW5jZQ.._38-h29}

Examples of machines that increase the distance over which force is
applied are leaf rakes and hammers (see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSW5jcmVhc2luZ0Rpc3RhbmNl) ). Read below
to find out how these two machines work. In each case, the machine
increases the distance over which the force is applied, but it reduces
the strength of the force.

### Changing the Direction of Force {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2hhbmdpbmcgdGhlIERpcmVjdGlvbiBvZiBGb3JjZQ.._38-kkc}

Some machines change the direction of the force applied by the user.
They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the
distance over which the force is applied. Two examples of machines that
work this way are the claw ends of hammers and flagpole pulleys. You can
see in the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVsbGluZ0ZsYWc.)
how each of these machines works. In both cases, the direction of the
force applied by the user is reversed by the machine.

</div>

**Q** : If the pulley only changes the direction of the force, how does
it make the work of raising the flag easier?

**A** : The pulley makes it easier to lift the flag because it allows a
person to pull down on the rope and add his or her own weight to the
effort, rather than simply lifting the load.

### Simple and Compound Machines {#5.html#x-ck12-U2ltcGxlIGFuZCBDb21wb3VuZCBNYWNoaW5lcw.._38-l1b}

There are six types of simple machines that are the basis of all other
machines. They are the inclined plane, lever, wedge, screw, pulley, and
wheel and axle. The six types are pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtNk1hY2hpbmVz) . You’ve probably used some
of these simple machines yourself. Most machines are combinations of two
or more simple machines. These machines are called compound machines. An
example of a compound machine is a wheelbarrow (see bottom of **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtNk1hY2hpbmVz) ). It consists of two
simple machines: a lever and a wheel and axle. Many compound machines
are much more complex and consist of many simple machines. Examples
include washing machines and cars.

This man is pushing heavy boxes on a dolly. If he were to push the boxes
across the ground without the dolly, it would take a lot more force
because he would have to overcome the sliding friction between the boxes
and the ground. Using a dolly reduces the friction because rolling
friction between the wheels and the ground is much less than sliding
friction.

### Machines and Friction {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFjaGluZXMgYW5kIEZyaWN0aW9u_39-orh}

A dolly is a machine because it changes a force to make work easier.
What is work? In physics, work is defined as the use of force to move an
object over a distance. It is represented by the equation:

Work = Force x Distance

All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of
work that is done. You can never get more work out of a machine than you
put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than
the user does on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of
the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is the force that
opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines
involve motion, so they all have friction. How much work is needed to
overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency.

### Machine Efficiency {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFjaGluZSBFZmZpY2llbmN5_39-syq}

Efficiency is the percent of work put into a machine by the user (input
work) that becomes work done by the machine (output work). The output
work is always less than the input work because some of the input work
is used to overcome friction. Therefore, efficiency is always less than
100 percent. The closer to 100 percent a machine’s efficiency is, the
better it is at reducing friction. Look at the ramp in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnVybml0dXJl) . A ramp is a type of
simple machine called an inclined plane. It is easier to push the heavy
piece of furniture up the ramp to the truck than to lift it straight up
off the ground, but pushing the furniture over the surface of the ramp
creates a lot of friction. Some of the force applied to moving the
furniture must be used to overcome the friction with the ramp.

**Figure 5.80**

</div>

**Q** : Why would it be more efficient to use a dolly to roll the
furniture up the ramp?

**A** : There would be less friction to overcome if you used a dolly
because of the wheels. So the efficiency of the ramp would be greater
with the dolly.

### Calculating Efficiency {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgRWZmaWNpZW5jeQ.._39-zoa}

Efficiency can be calculated with the equation:

![\\text{Efficiency}=\\frac{\\text{Output work}}{\\text{Input work}}
\\times
100\\%](ck12_math_images_dir/6056783b9a14a54d30eb088573a14233.png)

Consider a machine that puts out 6000 joules of work. To produce that
much work from the machine requires the user to put in 8000 joules of
work. To find the efficiency of the machine, substitute these values
into the equation for efficiency:

![\\frac{6000 \\ \\text{J}}{8000 \\ \\text{J}} \\times
100\\%=75\\%](ck12_math_images_dir/82f08e1edb2e3e09f2645dc12df6057f.png)

**Q** : Rani puts 7500 joules of work into pushing a box up a ramp, but
only 6700 joules of work actually go into moving the box. The rest of
the work overcomes friction between the box and the ramp. What is the
efficiency of the ramp?

**A** : The efficiency of the ramp is:

![\\frac{6700 \\ \\text{J}}{7500 \\ \\text{J}} \\times
100\\%=90\\%](ck12_math_images_dir/1ef3d5ecfde311400cd6b58ebb626d2c.png)

Did you ever use a hammer to break open a piggy bank? When you use a
hammer to hit something, you apply force to the end of the handle. The
head of the hammer, in turn, applies force to the piggy bank or whatever
object you are striking. The head of the hammer moves farther than you
move the handle with your hand. For all machines—not just hammers—the
user applies force (input force) to the machine over a certain distance
(input distance). The machine, in turn, applies force (output force) to
an object, also over a certain distance (output distance). A machine
makes work easier by changing the force or the distance over which the
force is applied.  

### What Is Mechanical Advantage? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBNZWNoYW5pY2FsIEFkdmFudGFnZT8._40-ma1}

How much a machine changes the input force is its **mechanical
advantage** . Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force to
the input force, so it can be represented by the equation:

![\\mathrm{Actual\\;Mechanical\\;Advantage=\\frac{Output\\;force}{Input\\;force}}](ck12_math_images_dir/edeecf2b3c6364c679d4902909fdda1e.png)

Note that this equation represents the *actual* mechanical advantage of
a machine. The actual mechanical advantage takes into account the amount
of the input force that is used to overcome friction. The equation
yields the factor by which the machine changes the input force when the
machine is actually used in the real world.

### Ideal Mechanical Advantage {#5.html#x-ck12-SWRlYWwgTWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2U._40-8sl}

It can be difficult to measure the input and output forces needed to
calculate the actual mechanical advantage of a machine. Generally, an
unknown amount of the input force is used to overcome friction. It’s
usually easier to measure the input and output distances than the input
and output forces. The distance measurements can then be used to
calculate the *ideal* mechanical advantage. The ideal mechanical
advantage represents the change in input force that would be achieved by
the machine if there were no friction to overcome. The ideal mechanical
advantage is always greater than the actual mechanical advantage because
all machines have to overcome friction. Ideal mechanical advantage can
be calculated with the equation:

![\\mathrm{Ideal\\;Mechanical\\;Advantage=\\frac{Input\\;Distance}{Output\\;Distance}}](ck12_math_images_dir/e238df627e85a39b11e1fbf4416fa4b8.png)

You can watch a video about actual and ideal mechanical advantage at
this URL:

### A Simple Example {#5.html#x-ck12-QSBTaW1wbGUgRXhhbXBsZQ.._40-sca}

Look at the ramp in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFtcA..) . A ramp is a type of simple
machine called an inclined plane. It can be used to raise an object off
the ground. The input distance is the length of the sloped surface of
the ramp. This is the distance over which the input force is applied.
The output distance is the height of the ramp, or the vertical distance
the object is raised. For this ramp, the input distance is 6 m and the
output distance is 2 meters. Therefore, the ideal mechanical advantage
of this ramp is:

![\\text{Ideal Mechanical Advantage}=\\frac{\\text{Input
distance}}{\\text{Output distance}}=\\frac{6 \\ \\text{m}}{2 \\
\\text{m}}=3](ck12_math_images_dir/5b5ef424db44bc3dc732d613254b865f.png)

An ideal mechanical advantage of 3 means that the ramp ideally (in the
absence of friction) multiplies the input force by a factor of 3. The
trade-off is that the input force must be applied over a greater
distance than the object is lifted.

### Mechanical Advantage of Different Types of Machines {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgRGlmZmVyZW50IFR5cGVzIG9mIE1hY2hpbmVz_40-bct}

Many machines—including inclined planes such as ramps—increase the
strength of the force put into the machine but decrease the distance
over which the force is applied. Other machines increase the distance
over which the force is applied but decrease the strength of the force.
Still other machines change the direction of the force, with or without
also increasing its strength or distance. Which way a machine works
determines its mechanical advantage, as shown in the **Table**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TWVjaGFuaWNhbC1BZHZhbnRhZ2U.) .

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._40-v0l}

-   The actual mechanical advantage of a machine reflects the increase
    or decrease in force achieved by the machine. It takes into account
    the force needed to overcome friction.
-   The actual mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation:
    ![\\mathrm{Actual\\;Mechanical\\;Advantage=\\frac{Output\\;force}{Input\\;force}}](ck12_math_images_dir/edeecf2b3c6364c679d4902909fdda1e.png)
-   The ideal mechanical advantage of a machine reflects the increase or
    decrease in force there would be without friction. It is always
    greater than the actual mechanical advantage because all machines
    must overcome friction.
-   The ideal mechanical advantage can be calculated with the equation:
    ![\\mathrm{Ideal\\;Mechanical\\;Advantage=\\frac{Input\\;Distance}{Output\\;Distance}}](ck12_math_images_dir/e238df627e85a39b11e1fbf4416fa4b8.png)
-   The mechanical advantage of a machine may be greater than, less
    than, or equal to 1, depending on the type of machine.

The highway above switches back and forth as it climbs up the steep
hillside. The much gentler slope of the road makes it easier for
vehicles to reach the top of the mountain. The highway is an example of
an inclined plane.

### What Is an Inclined Plane? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBJbmNsaW5lZCBQbGFuZT8._41-7id}

An **inclined plane** is a simple machine that consists of a sloping
surface connecting a lower elevation to a higher elevation. An inclined
plane is one of six types of simple machines, and it is one of the
oldest and most basic. In fact, two other simple machines, the wedge and
the screw, are variations of the inclined plane.

A ramp like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW92ZXJz) is another example of an
inclined plane. Inclined planes make it easier to move objects to a
higher elevation. The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports
part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result,
it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the
object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved
straight up to the higher elevation. You can see several other examples
of inclined planes at this URL:

### Mechanical Advantage of an Inclined Plane {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgYW4gSW5jbGluZWQgUGxhbmU._41-xwo}

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it
multiplies the force applied to the machine. It is the ratio of output
force (the force put out by the machined) to input force (the force put
into the machine). For an inclined plane, less force is put into moving
an object up the slope than if the object were lifted straight up, so
the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. The more gradual the slope
of the inclined plane, the less input force is needed and the greater
the mechanical advantage.

**Q** : Which inclined plane pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFtcHM.) has a greater mechanical
advantage?

**A** : The inclined plane on the right has a more gradual slope, so it
has a greater mechanical advantage. Less force is needed to move objects
up the gentler slope, yet the objects attain the same elevation as they
would if more force were used to push them up the steeper slope.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._41-a3g}

-   An inclined plane is a simple machine that consists of a sloping
    surface connecting a lower elevation to a higher elevation. It is
    used to move objects more easily to the higher elevation.
-   Less force is needed to move an object uphill with an inclined
    plane, but the force must be applied over a greater distance.
-   The mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is always greater than
    1, because the machine puts out more force than the user puts
    into it.

A chisel is a very useful tool for carving wood, rocks, and other hard
substances. This man is using a chisel to remove large pieces of wood. A
chisel is a type of machine called a wedge.

### What Is a Wedge? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFdlZGdlPw.._42-p3q}

A **wedge** is simple machine that consists of two inclined planes,
giving it a thin end and thick end, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2VkZ2Ux) . A wedge is used to cut or
split apart objects. Force is applied to the thick end of the wedge, and
the wedge, in turn, applies force to the object along both of its
sloping sides. This force causes the object to split apart.

### Mechanical Advantage of a Wedge {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgYSBXZWRnZQ.._42-bj0}

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it
multiplies the force applied to the machine. It is the ratio of the
output force to the input force. A wedge applies more force to the
object (output force) than the user applies to the wedge (input force),
so the mechanical advantage of a wedge is greater than 1. A longer,
thinner wedge has a greater mechanical advantage than a shorter, wider
wedge. With all wedges, the trade-off is that the output force is
applied over a shorter distance, so force may need to be applied to the
wedge repeatedly to push it through the object.

-   A wedge is a simple machine that consists of two inclined planes,
    giving it a thin end and thick end. Force is applied to the thick
    end of the wedge, and the sloping sides of the wedge apply force to
    the object, cutting it or splitting it apart.
-   A wedge makes work easier by increasing the force applied to the
    object, although it applies the force over a shorter distance. This
    gives the wedge a mechanical advantage greater than 1.

This old chimney has a spiral staircase wrapped around it. The spiral
staircase contains an inclined plane, or ramp. Do you see it? The stairs
that wrap around the outside wall of the chimney make up the inclined
plane. Together with the chimney, they represent a machine called a
screw.

### What Is a Screw {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFNjcmV3_43-nuh}

A **screw** is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane
wrapped around a central cylinder. No doubt you are familiar with screws
like the wood screw in the left-hand side of the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2NyZXdz) . The cap of the bottle
pictured on the right is another example of a screw. Screws move objects
to a greater depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied
to the screw. Many screws are used to hold things together, such as two
pieces of wood or a screw cap and bottle. When you use a screw, you
apply force to turn the inclined plane. The screw, in turn, applies
greater force to the object, such as the wood or bottle top. You can
watch an animation of a turning screw at the following URL.

**Q** : Can you identify the inclined plane in each example of a screw
pictured in the **Figure** [above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2NyZXdz) ?

**A** : The inclined plane of the screw on the left consists of the
ridges, or threads, that wrap around the central cylinder of the screw.
The inclined plane of the cap on the right consists of the ridges that
wrap around the inner sides of the cap.

### Mechanical Advantage of a Screw {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgYSBTY3Jldw.._43-bgw}

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it
multiplies the force applied to the machine. It is the ratio of the
output force to the input force. The force applied by the screw (output
force) is always greater than the force applied to the screw (input
force). Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater
than 1.

Look at the two screws in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2NyZXdzNDU5) . In the screw on the
right, the threads of the inclined plane are closer together. This screw
has a greater mechanical advantage and is easier to turn than the screw
on the left, so it takes less force to penetrate the wood with the right
screw. The trade-off is that more turns of the screw are needed to do
the job because the distance over which the input force must be applied
is greater.

**Q** : Why is it harder to turn a screw with more widely spaced
threads?

**A** : The screw moves farther with each turn when the threads are more
widely space, so more force must be applied to turn the screw and cover
the greater distance.

-   A screw is a simple machine that consists of an inclined plane
    wrapped around a central cylinder. Screws move objects to a greater
    depth (or higher elevation) by increasing the force applied to the

-   The mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1 because

A hammer can be used to pull a nail out of a board. You can see how it’s
done in this picture. When you push down on the handle of the hammer,
the claw end of the hammer pulls up on the nail. A hammer is an example
of a machine called a lever.  

### What Is a Lever? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIExldmVyPw.._44-u1f}

A **lever** is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around
a fixed point. The fixed point of a lever is called the fulcrum. Like
other machines, a lever makes work easier by changing the force applied
to the machine or the distance over which the force is applied. For a
video introduction to levers using skateboards as examples, go to this
URL:

How does a hammer make it easier to pull a nail out of a board? First,
it changes the direction of the force applied to the hammer—the hand
pushes down on the handle while the claw end of the hammer head pulls
up. Often, you can push down with more force than you can push up
because you can put your own weight behind it. The hammer also increases
the strength of the force that is applied to it. It easily pulls the
nail out of the board, which you couldn’t do with your hands alone. On
the other hand, the hammer decreases the distance over which the force
is applied. The hand pushing down on the handle moves the handle over a
distance of several inches, whereas the hammer pulls up on the nail only
an inch or two.

**Q** : Where is the fulcrum of the hammer when it is used to pull a
nail out of a board? In other words, around what point does the hammer
rotate?

**A** : The fulcrum is the point where the head of the hammer rests on
the surface of the board.

### Classes of Levers {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NlcyBvZiBMZXZlcnM._44-wj0}

Other levers change force or distance in different ways than a hammer
removing a nail. How a lever changes force or distance depends on the
location of the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum. The
input force is the force applied by the user to the lever. The output
force is the force applied by the lever to the object. Based on the
location of input and output forces, there are three basic types of
levers, called first-class, second-class, and third-class levers. The
**Table** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q2xhc3Nlc0xldmVycw..) describes
the three classes. You can see animations of the classes, as well as
more examples, at this URL:

</div>

-   Δ = fulcrum I = input force O = output force

The **Table** [above](#5.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q2xhc3Nlc0xldmVycw..)
includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The
mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input
force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in
force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use
of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the
ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual
mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.

**Q** : Which class of lever is a hammer when it is used to pry a nail
out of a board? What is its mechanical advantage?

**A** : To pry a nail out of a board, the fulcrum is located between the
input and output forces. Therefore, when a hammer is used in this way it
is a first class lever. The fulcrum is closer to the output force than
the input force, so the mechanical advantage is &gt; 1. In other words,
the hammer increases the force applied to it, making it easier to pry
the nail out of the board.

### Comparing Classes of Levers {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFyaW5nIENsYXNzZXMgb2YgTGV2ZXJz_44-jx8}

All three classes of levers make work easier, but they do so in
different ways.

-   When the input and output forces are on opposite sides of the
    fulcrum, the lever changes the direction of the applied force. This
    occurs only with first-class levers.
-   When both the input and output forces are on the same side of the
    fulcrum, the direction of the applied force does not change. This
    occurs with both second-class and third-class levers.
-   When the input force is applied farther from the fulcrum than the
    output force is, the output force is greater than the input force,
    and the ideal mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This always
    occurs with second-class levers and may occur with
    first-class levers.
-   When the input force is applied closer to the fulcrum than the
    output force is, the output force is less than the input force, and
    the ideal mechanical advantage is less than 1. This always occurs
    with third-class levers and may occur with first-class levers.
-   When the input and output forces are the same distance from the
    fulcrum, the output force equals the input force, and the ideal
    mechanical advantage is 1. This occurs only with first some
    first-class levers.

### Advantage of Third Class Levers {#5.html#x-ck12-QWR2YW50YWdlIG9mIFRoaXJkIENsYXNzIExldmVycw.._44-wlf}

You may be wondering why you would use a third-class lever when it
doesn’t change the direction or strength of the applied force. The
advantage of a third-class lever is that the output force is applied
over a greater distance than the input force. The output end of the
lever must move faster than the input end in order to cover the greater
distance.

**Q** : A broom is a third-class lever when it is used to sweep a floor
(see the **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3dlZXA.) ), so the
output end of the lever moves faster than the input end. Why is this
useful?

**A** : By moving more quickly over the floor, the broom does the work
faster.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._44-hyo}

-   A lever is a simple machine consisting of a bar that rotates around
    a fixed point called the fulcrum.
-   Based on the location of the input and output forces relative to the
    fulcrum, there are three basic types of levers: first-class,
    second-class, and third-class levers. The classes differ in their
    mechanical advantage and whether they change the direction of the
    input force.

Did you ever ride on a Ferris wheel like this one? If you did, then you
know how thrilling the ride can be. The faster it goes, the more
exciting it is. A Ferris wheel is an example of a machine called a wheel
and axle.

### Round and Round It Goes {#5.html#x-ck12-Um91bmQgYW5kIFJvdW5kIEl0IEdvZXM._45-cbo}

A **wheel and axle** is a simple machine that consists of two connected
rings or cylinders, one inside the other. Both rings or cylinders turn
in the same direction around a single center point. The inner ring or
cylinder is called the axle, and the outer one is called the wheel.
Besides the Ferris wheel, the doorknob in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRG9vcmtub2I.) is another example of a
wheel and axle. For more examples, go to this URL:

**Figure 5.92**

</div>

In a wheel and axle, force may be applied either to the wheel or to the
axle. This force is called the input force. A wheel and axle does not
change the direction of the input force. However, the force put out by
the machine, called the output force, is either greater than the input
force or else applied over a greater distance.

**Q** : Where is the force applied in a Ferris wheel and a doorknob? Is
it applied to the wheel or to the axle?

**A** : In a Ferris wheel, the force is applied to the axle by the
Ferris wheel’s motor. In a doorknob, the force is applied to the wheel
by a person’s hand.

### Mechanical Advantage of a Wheel and Axle {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgYSBXaGVlbCBhbmQgQXhsZQ.._45-mzo}

The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which the machine
changes the input force. It equals the ratio of the output force to the
input force. A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input
force, depending on whether the input force is applied to the axle or
the wheel.

-   When the input force is applied to the axle, as it is with a Ferris
    wheel, the wheel turns with less force. Because the output force is
    less than the input force, the mechanical advantage is less than 1.
    However, the wheel turns over a greater distance, so it turns faster
    than the axle. The speed of the wheel is one reason that the Ferris
    wheel ride is so exciting.
-   When the input force is applied to the wheel, as it is with a
    doorknob, the axle turns over a shorter distance but with greater
    force, so the mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This allows
    you to turn the doorknob with relatively little effort, while the
    axle of the doorknob applies enough force to slide the bar into or
    out of the doorframe. At the following URL, you can see how much a
    wheel and axle increases the input force when it is applied to
    the wheel.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._45-4s3}

-   A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected
    rings or cylinders, one inside the other, which both turn in the
    same direction around a single center point.
-   A wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force,
    depending on whether the input force is applied to the axle or
    the wheel. Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a wheel and axle
    may be greater than 1 or less than 1.

This rusty iron wheel has a rope wrapped around it. The wheel and rope
hang over a building. Together they make up a type of machine called a
pulley.  

### What Is a Pulley? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFB1bGxleT8._46-hmw}

A **pulley** is a simple machine that consists of a rope and grooved
wheel. The rope fits into the groove in the wheel, and pulling on the
rope turns the wheel. Pulleys are generally used to lift objects,
especially heavy objects. The object lifted by a pulley is called the
load. The force applied to the pulley is called the effort.

**Q** : Can you guess what the pulley pictured above is used for?

**A** : The pulley is used to lift heavy buckets full of water out of
the well.

### Types of Pulleys {#5.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUHVsbGV5cw.._46-zvz}

Some pulleys are attached to a beam or other secure surface and remain
fixed in place. They are called fixed pulleys. Other pulleys are
attached to the object being moved and are moveable themselves. They are
called moveable pulleys. Sometimes, fixed and moveable pulleys are used
together. They make up a compound pulley. The three types of pulleys are
compared in the **Table**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHVsbGV5VGFibGU.) . You can experiment
with an interactive animation of compound pulleys with various numbers
of pulleys at this link:

[http://www.walter-fendt.de/ph14e/pulleysystem.htm](pulleysystem.htm)

**Q** : Which type of pulley is the old pulley in the opening image?

**A** : The old pulley is a single fixed pulley. It is securely attached
to the beam above it.

### Mechanical Advantage of Pulleys {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgUHVsbGV5cw.._46-xh5}

The mechanical advantage of a simple machine such as a pulley is the
factor by which the machine changes the force applied to it. The ideal
mechanical advantage of a machine is its mechanical advantage in the
absence of friction. All machines must overcome friction, so the ideal
mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual
mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.

In a pulley, the ideal mechanical advantage is equal to the number of
rope segments pulling up on the object. The more rope segments that are
helping to do the lifting work, the less force that is needed for the
job. Look at the table of types of pulleys. It gives the ideal
mechanical advantage of each type.

-   In the single fixed pulley, only one rope segment pulls up on the
    load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. In other words, this
    type of pulley doesn’t increase the force that is applied to it.
    However, it does change the direction of the force. This allows you
    to use your weight to pull on one end of the rope and more easily
    raise the load attached to the other end.
-   In the single moveable pulley, two rope segments pull up on the
    load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 2. This type of pulley
    doesn’t change the direction of the force applied to it, but it
    increases the force by a factor of 2.
-   In a compound pulley, two or more rope segments pull up on the load,
    so the ideal mechanical advantage is 2 or greater than 2. This type
    of pulley may or may not change the direction of the force applied
    to it—it depends on the number and arrangement of pulleys—but the
    increase in force may be great.

To learn more about the mechanical advantage of different types of
pulleys, watch the video at this link:

Click on the image above for more content

**Q** : If a compound pulley has four rope segments pulling up on the
load, by what factor does it multiply the force applied to the pulley?

**A** : With four rope segments, the ideal mechanical advantage is 4.
This means that the compound pulley multiplies the force applied to it
by a factor of 4. For example if 400 Newtons of force were applied to
the pulley, the pulley would apply 1600 Newtons of force to the load.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._46-x5b}

-   A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a rope wrapped around

A **compound machine** is a machine that consists of more than one
simple machine. Some compound machines consist of just two simple
machines. You can read below about two examples—the wheelbarrow and
corkscrew. Other compound machines, such as bicycles, consist of many
simple machines. Big compound machines such as cars may consist of
hundreds or even thousands of simple machines. You can see a student’s

### Wheelbarrow {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hlZWxiYXJyb3c._47-wal}

Look at the wheelbarrow in the **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2hlZWxiYXJyb3c.) . It is used to carry
heavy objects. It consists of two simple machines: a lever and a wheel
and axle. Effort is applied to the lever by picking up the handles of
the wheelbarrow. The lever, in turn, applies upward force to the load.
The force is increased by the lever, making the load easier to lift.
Effort is applied to the wheel of the wheelbarrow by pushing it over the
ground. The rolling wheel turns the axle and increases the force, making
it easier to push the load.

It is used to pierce a cork and pull it out of the neck of a bottle. It
consists of a screw and two levers. Turning the handle on top twists the
screw down into the center of the cork. Then, pushing down on the two
levers causes the screw to pull upward, bringing the cork with it. The

### Efficiency of Compound Machines {#5.html#x-ck12-RWZmaWNpZW5jeSBvZiBDb21wb3VuZCBNYWNoaW5lcw.._47-evl}

Friction is a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are
touching. All machines have moving parts and friction, so they have to
use some of the work that is applied to them to overcome friction. This
makes all machines less than 100 percent efficient. Because compound
machines have more moving parts than simple machines, they generally
have more friction to overcome. As a result, compound machines tend to
have lower efficiency than simple machines. When a compound machine
consists of many simple machines, friction can become a serious problem,
and it may produce a lot of heat. Lubricants such as oil or grease may
be used to coat the moving parts of a machine so they slide over each
other more easily. This is how friction is reduced in a car engine.

### Mechanical Advantage of Compound Machines {#5.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgQ29tcG91bmQgTWFjaGluZXM._47-rk6}

The mechanical advantage of a machine is the factor by which it changes
the force applied to the machine. Many machines increase the force
applied to them, and this is how they make work easier. Compound
machines tend to have a greater mechanical advantage than simple
machines. That’s because the mechanical advantage of a compound machine
equals the product of the mechanical advantages of all its component
simple machines. The greater the number of simple machines it contains,
the greater its mechanical advantage tends to be.

**Q** : Assume that the lever and the wheel and axle of a wheelbarrow
each have a mechanical advantage of 2. What is the mechanical advantage
of the wheelbarrow?

**A** : The mechanical advantage of the wheelbarrow is the product of
the mechanical advantage of the lever (2) and the mechanical advantage
of the wheel and axle (2). Therefore, the wheelbarrow has a mechanical
advantage of 4.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._47-e6g}

-   A compound machine is a machine that consists of more than one
    simple machine.
-   Compound machines such as a wheelbarrow or corkscrew consist of just
    two simple machines. Big compound machines such as cars consist of
    hundreds or thousands of simple machines.
-   Compared with simple machines, compound machines generally have
    lower efficiency but greater mechanical advantage.

## Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-5ms}

This unit includes the concepts of motion, speed, velocity, and
acceleration. Forces are introduced, including friction, gravity,
elastic force, and forces in fluids. Newton’s laws of motion are
examined in detail. The unit also defines work and power, and explains
how machines help us do work.

The surfer in this photo is dwarfed by the immense wave he’s riding, yet
he’s managing to use the incredible energy of the wave for a thrilling
ride. Ocean waves like this one carry a huge amount of energy. Do you
know what energy is? Can you identify other forms of energy besides
ocean waves? In this unit, you’ll learn a lot about energy, including
how it makes modern life possible—even if you never ride a surfboard!

![A dynamite explosion is a chemical

#### What are some types of chemical reactions? {#6.html#x-ck12-MDQ2Njk4ODIyNDk2OGM5OWU5NTQ5OTEwZDU3ODc2YzI.-9mv-byc}

Some chemistry reactions can be very calm and boring, while other
reactions release a great deal of energy.  Dynamite is a chemical that
can explode violently.  Here we see dynamite being used to move boulders
to clear a path for a road.  The chemical reactions involved here
release tremendous amounts of energy very quickly.

Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1866. Nitroglycerin, a very
unstable explosive, was already known.  Nobel mixed the nitroglycerin
with silica to stabilize it and form a solid material. He made a fortune
with this discovery and established the Nobel Foundation, which funds
the Nobel Prizes every year.

### Energy in Chemical Bonds {#6.html#x-ck12-YTk1NGVmMmMxZjhiYjUwODFjNzMyZTAyMTI5M2Y2YTU.-dhj-j5k}

**Chemical reactions** either require **energy** or release energy. The
amount of energy needed or released depends upon the structure of the
molecules that are involved in the reaction.  Some reactions need to be
heated for long periods of time in order for change to take place. 
Other reactions release energy, allowing heat to be given off to the
surroundings.

This energy can be used in a variety of ways.

#### Heating {#6.html#x-ck12-MDFkMTE5MjhhNDVmM2UyMmRiNzA4MzFhNmUzNmNhNTI.-vi6-ywc}

Coal, natural gas, oil – these materials can be burned to produce heat. 
The reaction with oxygen releases a great deal of energy that can warm
homes and offices.  Wood is another example of a chemical (yes, a very
complicated one) that will release energy when burned.

#### Transportation {#6.html#x-ck12-YTYwMDk3MWZkZDIzZWExZjU2ODVkN2VlMDFkNWY1YzM.-oix-2gn}

A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes,
trains, and other vehicles.  The chemical used are usually a mixture of
compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain.  When the material
is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. 
This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion
engine to provide power.  A jet plane works on a similar principle.  Air
comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel.  This
mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push
the plane forward.  The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case
of a rocket launch.  The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or
liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the
rocket up.

#### Batteries {#6.html#x-ck12-YTY0ZmY2ODEzYThjN2UyZDE5ZTI5NTAxYWUyMTM2NzU.-lxj-4dc}

A major source of energy produced by chemical reactions involves
batteries.  There are many types of batteries that operate using a
variety of chemical reactions.  The general principle behind these
reactions is the release of electrons that can then flow through a
circuit, producing an electrical current.

**Figure 6.2**

Car battery.

</div>

Batteries are used in a wide variety of applications:

1.  flashlights
2.  watches
3.  computers
4.  cars
5.  hybrid vehicles – provide some power to wheels
6.  cell phones
7.  many other uses

Batteries in cars, computers, cell phones, and other devices are usually
rechargeable.  An electric current is passed through the battery to
provide electrons that reverse (at least partially) the chemical
reactions originally used to create the electric current.  However,

#### Hand-Warmers {#6.html#x-ck12-NDMxMTMzYTAwZmRiOWFjZmMxOTIzOTc5OTU5ZmZhOTI.-yg9-dwm}

Hikers, campers, and other outdoor folks take advantage of chemical
reactions to keep their hands warm.  Small containers of chemicals can
undergo reaction to generate heat that can be used to avoid frostbite. 
Some products contain iron filings that will react with air to release
thermal energy.  These types of warmer cannot be reused. Other systems
rely on heat being released when certain chemicals crystallize. If the
warmer is placed in very hot water after use, the system can be
regenerated.

What could these four photos possibly have in common? Can you guess what
it is? All of them show things that have kinetic energy.  

### Defining Kinetic Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgS2luZXRpYyBFbmVyZ3k._1-ggu}

**Kinetic energy** is the energy of moving matter. Anything that is
moving has kinetic energy—from atoms in matter to stars in outer space.
Things with kinetic energy can do work. For example, the spinning saw
blade in the photo above is doing the work of cutting through a piece of
metal.

### Calculating Kinetic Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgS2luZXRpYyBFbmVyZ3k._1-apq}

The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends directly on its
mass and velocity. An object with greater mass or greater velocity has
more kinetic energy. You can calculate the kinetic energy of a moving
object with this equation:

![\\mathrm{Kinetic\\; Energy\\; (KE)=\\frac{1}{2} mass \\times
velocity\^2}](ck12_math_images_dir/1e8cf115547ba569d5f03bba52f2c311.png)

This equation shows that an increase in velocity increases kinetic
energy more than an increase in mass. If mass doubles, kinetic energy
doubles as well, but if velocity doubles, kinetic energy increases by a
factor of four. That’s because velocity is squared in the equation.

Let’s consider an example. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmVhY2g.) shows Juan running on the beach
with his dad. Juan has a mass of 40 kg and is running at a velocity of 1
m/s. How much kinetic energy does he have? Substitute these values for
mass and velocity into the equation for kinetic energy:

![\\text{KE}=\\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\ \\text{kg} \\times
(1\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}})\^2=20 \\ \\text{kg} \\times
\\frac{\\text{m}\^2}{\\text{s}\^2}=20 \\ \\text{N} \\cdot
\\text{m},](ck12_math_images_dir/da14e27e5ec9809ff74340f74adb39f8.png)
or ![20 \\
\\text{J}](ck12_math_images_dir/b1e7330cccfac7f6348081c46b58bbaa.png)

Notice that the answer is given in joules (J), or N • m, which is the SI
unit for energy. One joule is the amount of energy needed to apply a
force of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter.

What about Juan’s dad? His mass 80 kg, and he’s running at the same
velocity as Juan (1 m/s). Because his mass is twice as great as Juan’s,
his kinetic energy is twice as great:

![\\text{KE}=\\frac{1}{2} \\times 80 \\ \\text{kg} \\times (1
\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}})\^2=40 \\ \\text{kg} \\times

\\text{J}](ck12_math_images_dir/a1932f86b59f7dc71f14440a43564bd2.png)

**Q:** What is Juan’s kinetic energy if he speeds up to 2 m/s from 1
m/s?

**A:** By doubling his velocity, Juan increases his kinetic energy by a
factor of four:

![\\text{KE}=\\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\ \\text{kg} \\times (2
\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}})\^2=80 \\ \\text{kg} \\times

This diver has just jumped up from the end of the diving board. After
she dives down and is falling toward the water, she’ll have kinetic
energy, or the energy of moving matter. But even as she is momentarily
stopped high above the water, she has energy. Do you know why?

### Stored Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RvcmVkIEVuZXJneQ.._2-hmg}

The diver has energy because of her position high above the pool. The
type of energy she has is called potential energy. **Potential energy**
is energy that is stored in a person or object. Often, the person or
object has potential energy because of its position or shape.

**Q:** What is it about the diver’s position that gives her potential
energy?

**A:** Because the diver is high above the water, she has the potential
to fall toward Earth because of gravity. This gives her potential
energy.

### Gravitational Potential Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-R3Jhdml0YXRpb25hbCBQb3RlbnRpYWwgRW5lcmd5_2-tjw}

Potential energy due to the position of an object above Earth’s surface
is called gravitational potential energy. Like the diver on the diving
board, anything that is raised up above Earth’s surface has the
potential to fall because of gravity. You can see another example of
people with gravitational potential energy in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2xlZA..) . You can also watch a cartoon
introduction to gravitational potential energy by playing video \#10 at

**Figure 6.5**

</div>

Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s weight and its
height above the ground. It can be calculated with the equation:

Gravitational potential energy (GPE) = weight × height

Consider the little girl on the sled, pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2xlZA..) . She weighs 140 Newtons, and
the top of the hill is 4 meters higher than the bottom of the hill. As
she sits at the top of the hill, the child’s gravitational potential
energy is:

GPE = 140 N × 4 m = 560 N • m

Notice that the answer is given in Newton • meters (N • m), which is the
SI unit for energy. A Newton ∙ meter is the energy needed to move a
weight of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter. A Newton • meter is also
called a joule (J).

**Q:** The gymnast on the balance beam pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2xlZA..) weighs 360 Newtons. If the
balance beam is 1.2 meters above the ground, what is the gymnast’s
gravitational potential energy?

**A:** Her gravitational potential energy is:

GPE = 360 N × 1.2 m = 432 N • m, or 432 J

### Elastic Potential Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxhc3RpYyBQb3RlbnRpYWwgRW5lcmd5_2-zgd}

Potential energy due to an object’s shape is called elastic potential
energy. This energy results when an elastic object is stretched or
compressed. The farther the object is stretched or compressed, the
greater its potential energy is. A point will be reached when the object
can’t be stretched or compressed any more. Then it will forcefully
return to its original shape.

Look at the pogo stick in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUG9nbw..) . Its spring has elastic
potential energy when it is pressed down by the boy's weight. When it
can’t be compressed any more, it will spring back to its original shape.
The energy it releases will push the pogo stick—and the boy—off the
ground. You can see how a pogo stick spring compresses and then returns
to its original shape in the animation at this URL:

of her slingshot potential energy by stretching it. She’s holding a
small stone against the stretched band. What will happen when she
releases the band?

**A:** The elastic band will spring back to its original shape. When
that happens, watch out! Some of the band’s elastic potential energy
will be transferred to the stone, which will go flying through the air.

### Other Forms of Potential Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgRm9ybXMgb2YgUG90ZW50aWFsIEVuZXJneQ.._2-q42}

All of the examples of potential energy described above involve movement
or the potential to move. The form of energy that involves movement is
called mechanical energy. Other forms of energy also involve potential
energy, including chemical energy and nuclear energy. Chemical energy is
stored in the bonds between the atoms of compounds. For example, food
and batteries both contain chemical energy. Nuclear energy is stored in
the nuclei of atoms because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus
together. Nuclei of radioactive elements such as uranium are unstable,
so they break apart and release the stored energy.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-wie}

-   Potential energy is energy that is stored in a person or object.
-   Gravitational potential energy is due to the position of an object
    above Earth’s surface. The object has the potential to fall due
    to gravity. Gravitational potential energy depends on an object’s
    weight and its height above the ground (GPE = weight x height).
-   Elastic potential energy is due to an object’s shape. It results
    when an elastic object is stretched or compressed. The more it is
    stretched or compressed, the greater its elastic potential
    energy is.
-   Chemical energy and nuclear energy are other forms of
    potential energy.

This musician’s electric guitar wails at a concert, as colored lights
wash over the band. It’s hot on stage because of the lights, but they
really add to the show. The fans are thrilled and screaming with
excitement. The exciting concert wouldn’t be possible without several
different forms of energy. Do you know what they are?  

### Introducing Forms of Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgRm9ybXMgb2YgRW5lcmd5_3-bx0}

Energy, or the ability to cause changes in matter, can exist in many
different forms. Energy can also change from one form to another. The
photo above of the guitar player represents six forms of energy:
mechanical, chemical, electrical, light, thermal, and sound energy.
Another form of energy is nuclear energy. For an introduction to all of
these forms of energy, watch this video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZWICeFsNy0](watch?v=MZWICeFsNy0)
(8:25).

Click on the image above for more content

**Q:** Can you find the six different forms of energy in the photo of
the guitar player (See opening image)?

**A:** The guitarist uses *mechanical energy* to pluck the strings of
the guitar. He gets the energy he needs to perform from *chemical
energy* in food he ate earlier in the day. The stage lights use
*electrical energy* , which they change to *light energy* and *thermal
energy* (commonly called heat). The guitar produces *sound energy* when
the guitarist plucks the strings.

### Seven Forms of Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-U2V2ZW4gRm9ybXMgb2YgRW5lcmd5_3-rqt}

The different forms of energy are defined and illustrated below. For an

**Figure 6.8**

This drummer has mechanical energy as he moves the drumsticks to hit the
drums and cymbals. The moving drumsticks also have mechanical energy,
but they would have mechanical energy even if they weren't moving.
That's because they have the potential to fall when the drummer is
holding them above the floor. This potential energy is due to gravity.

</div>

**2. Chemical energy** is energy that is stored in the bonds between the
atoms of compounds. If the bonds are broken, the energy is released and
can be converted to other forms of energy.

of electromagnetic energy. Other types include radio waves, microwaves,
X rays, and gamma rays.

**5. Thermal energy** is the energy of moving atoms of matter. All
matter has thermal energy because atoms of all matter are constantly
moving. An object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an
object with less mass because it has more atoms.

Why is this jogger sweating so much? His sweat is soaking up his shirt
because he has so much thermal energy. Jogging is hot work because of
the heat from the sun and the hard work he puts into his run.

</div>

**6. Sound energy** is a form of mechanical energy that starts with a
vibration in matter. For example, the singer’s voice starts with
vibrations of his vocal cords, which are folds of tissue in his throat.
The vibrations pass to surrounding particles of matter and then from one
particle to another in waves. Sound waves can travel through air, water,
and other substances, but not through empty space.

**7. Nuclear energy** is energy that is stored in the nuclei of atoms
because of the strong forces that hold the nucleus together. The energy
can be released in nuclear power plants by splitting nuclei apart. It is
also released when unstable (radioactive) nuclei break down, or decay.

**Q:** The fans at a rock concert also produce or use several forms of
energy. What are they?

**A:** The fans see the concert because of *electromagnetic energy*
(light) that enters their eyes from the well-lit musicians on stage.
They hear the music because of the *sound energy* that reaches their
ears from the amplifiers. They use *mechanical energy* when they clap
their hands and jump from their seats in excitement. Their bodies

Sari and Daniel are spending a stormy Saturday afternoon with cartons of
hot popcorn and a spellbinding movie. They are obviously too focused on
the movie to wonder where all the energy comes from to power their
weekend entertainment. They’ll give it some thought halfway through the
movie when the storm causes the power to go out!

### Changing Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2hhbmdpbmcgRW5lcmd5_4-ku4}

Watching movies, eating hot popcorn, and many other activities depend on
electrical energy. Most electrical energy comes from the burning of
fossil fuels, which contain stored chemical energy. When fossil fuels
are burned, the chemical energy changes to thermal energy and the
thermal energy is then used to generate electrical energy. These are all
examples of energy conversion. **Energy conversion** is the process in
which one kind of energy changes into another kind. When energy changes
in this way, the energy isn’t used up or lost. The same amount of energy
exists after the conversion as before. Energy conversion obeys the law
of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed.

### How Energy Changes Form {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVuZXJneSBDaGFuZ2VzIEZvcm0._4-uu5}

Besides electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, some other forms of
energy include mechanical and sound energy. Any of these forms of energy
can change into any other form. Often, one form of energy changes into
two or more different forms. For example, the popcorn machine below
changes electrical energy to thermal energy. The thermal energy, in
turn, changes to both mechanical energy and sound energy. You can read
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUG9wY29ybg..) how these
changes happen. You can see other examples of energy changing form at
this URL:

**Figure 6.13**

1\. The popcorn machine changes electrical to thermal energy, which heats
the popcorn. 2. The heat causes the popcorn to pop. You can see that the
popping corn has mechanical energy (energy of movement). It overflows
the pot and falls into the pile of popcorn at the bottom of the machine.
3. The popping corn also has energy. That's why it makes popping sounds.

</div>

### Kinetic-Potential Energy Changes {#6.html#x-ck12-S2luZXRpYy1Qb3RlbnRpYWwgRW5lcmd5IENoYW5nZXM._4-lkb}

Mechanical energy commonly changes between kinetic and potential energy.
Kinetic energy is the energy of moving objects. Potential energy is
energy that is stored in objects, typically because of their position or
shape. Kinetic energy can be used to change the position or shape of an
object, giving it potential energy. Potential energy gives the object
the potential to move. If it does, the potential energy changes back to
kinetic energy.

That’s what happened to Sari. After she and Daniel left the theater, the
storm cleared and they went for a swim. That’s Sari in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2xpZGU.) coming down the water slide.
When she was at the top of the slide, she had potential energy. Why? She
had the potential to slide into the water because of the pull of
gravity. As she moved down the slide, her potential energy changed to
kinetic energy. By the time she reached the water, all the potential
energy had changed to kinetic energy.

**Figure 6.14**

</div>

**Q:** How could Sari regain her potential energy?

**A:** Sari could climb up the steps to the top of the slide. It takes
kinetic energy to climb the steps, and this energy would be stored in
Sari as she climbed. By the time she got to the top of the slide, she
would have the same amount of potential energy as before.

A roller coaster is another fun example of changes between kinetic and
potential energy. Watch the roller coaster animation at the URL below to
see the energy changes. Notice how the roller coaster’s total energy
(kinetic energy + potential energy) does not change.

**Q:** Can you think of other fun examples of energy changing between
kinetic and potential energy?

**A:** Playground equipment such as swings, slides, and trampolines
involve these changes.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-bq4}

    form or type to another. Energy is always conserved in
    energy conversions.
-   Different forms of energy—such as electrical, chemical, and thermal
    energy—often change to other forms of energy.

It may look beautiful, but this oil slick threatens the environment and
living things. Unfortunately, oil spills are common because we rely
heavily on oil as an energy resource. Oil is an example of a
nonrenewable resource.

### What Are Nonrenewable Resources? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTm9ucmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcz8._5-5ch}

**Nonrenewable resources** are natural resources that are limited in
supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up. A natural
resource is anything people can use that comes from nature. Energy
resources are some of the most important natural resources because
everything we do requires energy. Nonrenewable energy resources include
fossil fuels such as oil and the radioactive element uranium.

### Types of Fossil Fuels {#6.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgRm9zc2lsIEZ1ZWxz_5-scf}

Oil, or petroleum, is one of several **fossil fuels** . Fossil fuels are
mixtures of hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon)
that formed over millions of years from the remains of dead organisms.
In addition to oil, they include coal and natural gas. Fossil fuels
provide most of the energy used in the world today. They are burned in
power plants to produce electrical energy, and they also fuel cars, heat
homes, and supply energy for many other purposes. You can see some ways
they are used in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRm9zc2lsRnVlbHM.) . For a more detailed
introduction to fossil fuels, go to this URL:

![Various types fossil
fuels](ck12_6_files/20150911012805386610.jpeg "Various types fossil fuels")

**Figure 6.15**

</div>

**Q:** Why do fossil fuels have energy?

**A:** Fossil fuels contain stored chemical energy that came originally
from the sun.

### How Fossil Fuels Formed {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IEZvc3NpbCBGdWVscyBGb3JtZWQ._5-tmb}

When ancient plants underwent photosynthesis, they changed energy in
sunlight to stored chemical energy in food. The plants used the food and
so did the organisms that ate the plants. After the plants and other
organisms died, their remains gradually changed to fossil fuels as they
were covered and compressed by layers of sediments. Petroleum and
natural gas formed from ocean organisms and are found together. Coal
formed from giant tree ferns and other swamp plants.

### Fossil Fuels and the Environment {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9zc2lsIEZ1ZWxzIGFuZCB0aGUgRW52aXJvbm1lbnQ._5-5ht}

When fossil fuels burn, they release thermal energy, water vapor, and
carbon dioxide. The thermal energy can be used to generate electricity
or do other work. The carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere and
is a major cause of global climate change. The burning of fossil fuels
also releases many pollutants into the air. Pollutants such as sulfur
dioxide form acid rain, which kills living things and damages metals,
stonework, and other materials. Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides cause
smog, which is harmful to human health. Tiny particles, or particulates,
released when fossil fuels burn also harm human health.

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8xXzZfY2hhcnQ.) shows
the amounts of pollutants released by different fossil fuels. Natural
gas releases the least pollution; coal releases the most. Petroleum has
the additional risk of oil spills, which may seriously damage
ecosystems. To learn about other ways that our dependence on fossil
fuels damages the environment and threatens human life, watch the video
at this URL: [http://coal.wiki.lovett.org/Home](Home)

</div>

**Q:** Some newer models of cars and other motor vehicles can run on
natural gas. Why would a natural gas vehicle be better for the
environment than a vehicle that burns gasoline, which is made from oil?

**A:** Natural gas produces much less pollution and carbon dioxide when
it burns than gasoline does. So a natural gas vehicle would contribute
less to global climate change, acid rain, and air pollution that harms
health. Besides being better for the environment, burning natural gas
instead of gasoline results in less engine wear and provides more energy
for a given amount of fuel.

### Nuclear Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVhciBFbmVyZ3k._5-pfr}

Like fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to
generate electrical energy in power plants. This source of energy is
known as **nuclear energy** . In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of
uranium atoms are split apart into smaller nuclei in the process of
nuclear fission. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy
from just a small amount of uranium. The total supply of uranium in the
world is quite limited, however, and cannot be replaced once it is used
up. That’s why nuclear energy is a nonrenewable resource. The use of
nuclear energy also produces dangerous radioactive wastes. In addition,
accidents at nuclear power plants have the potential to release large
amounts of harmful radiation into the environment.

**Q:** Why is nuclear energy often considered to be “greener” than
energy from fossil fuels?

**A:** Unlike energy from fossil fuels, nuclear energy doesn’t produce
air pollution or carbon dioxide that contributes to global climate
change.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-xyo}

-   Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that are limited in
    supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up.
    Nonrenewable energy resources include fossil fuels and uranium.
-   Fossil fuels—including oil, natural gas, and coal—provide most of
    the energy used in the world today. Burning fossil fuels produces
    air pollution as well as carbon dioxide that causes global

-   Nuclear energy is produced by splitting the nuclei of
    radioactive uranium. This doesn’t release air pollution or carbon
    dioxide, but it does produce dangerous radioactive wastes.

Acre upon acre of wind turbines stretch over the landscape in this
photo. The blades of the turbines spin in the wind like giant pinwheels.
The energy of the moving blades is used to generate useful electrical
energy. Wind is one of several renewable energy resources.

**Q:** What are some other renewable energy resources?

**A:** You can read about the major renewable energy resources in this
article. But here’s a hint in advance. Renewable energy resources
include mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical, and thermal forms of
energy.

### What Are Renewable Resources? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgUmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcz8._6-tnt}

**Renewable resources** are natural resources that can be replaced in a
relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless in supply. In
addition to wind, renewable energy resources include sunlight, moving
water, biomass, and geothermal energy. All of these resources are freely
available and won’t run out. Most of them also have the advantage of
producing little if any pollution or carbon dioxide, which contributes
to global climate change. Nonetheless, these energy resources are used
far less than nonrenewable energy resources, especially fossil fuels.
You can see where renewable energy resources are used in the U.S., as
well as learn more about them, at this URL:
[http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/people/a\_energy.html](a_energy.html)

### Wind {#6.html#x-ck12-V2luZA.._6-jwx}

Wind is moving air, so it has mechanical energy that can do work. People
have been using wind for energy for thousands of years. The
old-fashioned windmill in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2luZG1pbGw.) is one way that wind energy
can be used. The wind turbines in the opening photo above are a much
newer way of using wind energy. They change the kinetic energy of the
wind to electrical energy. However, only certain areas of the world get
enough steady wind to produce much electricity. Many people also think
that wind turbines are noisy, dangerous to birds, and unattractive in
the landscape. At the URL below, you can watch a video about the
development of wind energy in China, which aims to become a world leader
in renewable energy production.

This old windmill uses wind energy to operate a mechanical pump that
lifts water out of a well. Windmills like this one have been used for
centuries.

</div>

**Q:** Where does the energy of the wind come from? Why does air move in
the atmosphere?

**A:** Wind is caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere by the sun.
In other words, differences in thermal energy cause air to move in the
atmosphere.

### Sunlight {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VubGlnaHQ._6-9fn}

The sunlight that reaches Earth is the planet’s most important source of
energy. The energy in sunlight, called solar energy, is electromagnetic
energy. This is a form of energy that travels through space in electric
and magnetic waves. Solar energy can be used to heat homes and produce
electricity in solar cells like those on the roof seen in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU29sYXI.) . Sunny areas receive plenty of
sunlight to generate electricity, but solar energy may not be practical
in areas that are often cloudy.

</div>

**Q:** In addition to the roofs of homes and other buildings, where else
can you find solar cells?

**A:** Calculators often have solar cells. Solar-powered outdoor lights
are very common as well.

### Moving Water {#6.html#x-ck12-TW92aW5nIFdhdGVy_6-c5r}

The mechanical energy of rapidly flowing water can turn a turbine and
generate electricity. Electricity produced in this way is called
hydroelectric power. The water may flow over a waterfall or through a
dam. You can see a picture of a dam in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSHlkcm8.) . A drawback of dams is that
they flood land upstream from the dam and reduce water flow downstream
from the dam, and this can destroy ecosystems. At the following URL, you
can learn more about hydroelectric power and see an animation of a
hydroelectric power plant.

This is Hoover dam on the Colorado River between Arizona and Nevada.
Water flowing through the dam generates electricity for both of these
states and southern California.

</div>

**Q:** Does a hydroelectric power plant release air pollution or carbon
dioxide? Why or why not.

**A:** No, it is doesn’t. A hydroelectric plant doesn’t burn fuel, which
is what produces air pollution in power plants that generate electricity
from fossil fuels or biomass.

### Biomass {#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvbWFzcw.._6-kkf}

The stored chemical energy in organic matter or wastes is called biomass
energy. The organic matter may be trees or other plants, or it may be
wastes from homes and industries. When biomass is burned, it produces
thermal energy that can be used for heating homes, cooking, or
generating electricity. Biomass—especially wood—is an important energy
source in the poorer nations where most people can’t afford fossil
fuels. However, burning biomass releases air pollution and contributes
to global climate change. Biomass can be used to make ethanol, a fuel
that is added to gasoline. Although ethanol releases less pollution than
gasoline, large areas of land are needed to grow the plants needed to
make it (see **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmlvbWFzcw..) ).
This reduces the amount of land available for food production.

### Geothermal Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VvdGhlcm1hbCBFbmVyZ3k._6-meo}

Geothermal energy is thermal (“heat”) energy from below Earth’s surface.
It can be used to heat homes or generate electricity. A geothermal
system pumps water underground where it is heated and then pumps the
warm water back to the home or power plant (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR2VvdGhlcm1hbA..) ). The thermal energy
of the water can be used directly to heat the home. Or it can be used to
produce steam and generate electricity. Installing a geothermal system
can be expensive because of the need to drill through underground rocks,
but the energy it uses is free.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-1mz}

-   Renewable resources are natural resources that can be replaced in a
    relatively short period of time or are virtually limitless
    in supply.
-   Renewable energy resources include wind, sunlight, moving water,
    biomass, and geothermal energy. Except for biomass, which is burned,
    these renewable energy resources produce little if any pollution,
    although each has other drawbacks.

This woman in Burkina Faso uses a simple wood fire for cooking. For many
people in the world, wood is their main energy resource. They burn it to
stay warm as well as to cook their food. Other energy resources, such as
oil or gas, are simply not available to them or are far too expensive
for most people to use. However, if you live in the U.S. or another of
the richer nations of the world, you probably depend almost totally on
these more expensive energy resources, especially oil.

### Use of Energy Resources {#6.html#x-ck12-VXNlIG9mIEVuZXJneSBSZXNvdXJjZXM._7-yim}

Look at the circle graph in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRW5lcmd5UGll) . It shows that oil is the
single most commonly used energy resource in the U.S., followed by
natural gas, and then by coal. All of these energy resources are
nonrenewable. **Nonrenewable resources** are resources that are limited
in supply and cannot be replaced as quickly as they are used up.
Renewable resources, in contrast, provide only 8 percent of all energy
used in the U.S. **Renewable resources** are natural resources that can
be replaced in a relatively short period of time or are virtually
limitless in supply. They include solar energy from sunlight, geothermal
energy from under Earth’s surface, wind, biomass (from once-living
things or their wastes), and hydropower (from running water).

### Oil Use by Nation {#6.html#x-ck12-T2lsIFVzZSBieSBOYXRpb24._7-fyf}

People in the U.S. use far more energy—especially energy from oil—than
people in any other nation. The bar graph in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmFyZ3JhcGg.) compares the amount of oil
used by the top ten oil-using nations. The U.S. uses more oil than
several other top-ten countries combined. If you also consider the
population size in these countries, the differences are even more
stunning. The average person in the U.S. uses a whopping 23 barrels of
oil a year! In comparison, the average person in India or China uses
just 1 or 2 barrels of oil a year. At the following URL, you can explore
energy use per person in the U.S. and other countries or regions of the
world over the past 50 years.

You won’t see this car on the road, at least not yet. It’s a concept car
that was developed by a major automaker. Instead of burning gasoline, it
runs on hydrogen gas. Using hydrogen for fuel doesn’t produce pollution,
and it doesn’t depend on nonrenewable fossil fuels. New technologies
like this car may one day help solve our energy resource problems. But
even without new technologies such as this, there are many ways we can
help solve the problems right now.

### Conserving Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmluZyBFbmVyZ3k._8-lxe}

Everyone can reduce their use of energy resources and the pollution the
resources cause by conserving energy. **Conservation** means saving
resources by using them more efficiently, using less of them, or not
using them at all. You can read below about some of the ways you can
conserve energy on the road and in the home. You can find more
energy-saving tips at this URL:
[http://www.partselect.ca/resources/Home-Energy-Saving-Tips.aspx](Home-Energy-Saving-Tips.aspx)

### Conserving Energy in Transportation {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmluZyBFbmVyZ3kgaW4gVHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24._8-xsv}

Much of the energy used in the U.S. is used for transportation. You can
conserve transportation energy in several ways. For example, you can:

-   plan ahead to avoid unnecessary trips.
-   take public transit such as subways (see **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3Vid2F5) ) instead of driving.
-   drive an energy-efficient vehicle when driving is the only way to
    get there.

</div>

**Q:** What are some other ways you could save energy in transportation?

**A:** You could carpool to save transportation energy. Even if you
carpool with just one other person, that’s one less vehicle on the road.
For short trips, you could ride a bike or walk to you destination. The
extra exercise is another benefit of using your own muscle power to get
where you need to go.

### Conserving Energy at Home {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmluZyBFbmVyZ3kgYXQgSG9tZQ.._8-fsd}

Many people waste energy at home, so a lot of energy can be saved there
as well. What can you do to conserve energy? You can:

-   turn off lights and unplug appliances and other electrical devices
    when not in use.
-   use energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances.
-   turn the thermostat down in winter and up in summer.

This unusual landscape is found in the hottest place in the U.S.: Death
Valley, California. The temperature of the air near the ground can be as
high as 57 °C (134 °F)—and that’s in the shade (if you can find any)!
The temperature of the sand in the baking sun can be much higher. If you
were to walk barefoot on the hot sand, it would burn your feet. The air
and sand in Death Valley have a lot of thermal energy.

### What Is Thermal Energy? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBUaGVybWFsIEVuZXJneT8._9-xjz}

Why do the air and sand of Death Valley feel so hot? It’s because their
particles are moving very rapidly. Anything that is moving has kinetic
energy, and the faster it is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. The
total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter is called **thermal
energy** . It’s not just hot things such as the air and sand of Death
Valley that have thermal energy. All matter has thermal energy, even
matter that feels cold. That’s because the particles of all matter are
in constant motion and have kinetic energy.

### Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Mass {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlcm1hbCBFbmVyZ3ksIFRlbXBlcmF0dXJlLCBhbmQgTWFzcw.._9-xfa}

Thermal energy and temperature are closely related. Both reflect the
kinetic energy of moving particles of matter. However, **temperature**
is the *average* kinetic energy of particles of matter, whereas thermal
energy is the *total* kinetic energy of particles of matter. Does this
mean that matter with a lower temperature has less thermal energy than
matter with a higher temperature? Not necessarily. Another factor also
affects thermal energy. The other factor is mass.

**Q:** Look at the pot of soup and the tub of water in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGVtcGVyYXR1cmUtVGhlcm1hbEVuZXJneQ..) .
Which do you think has greater thermal energy?

**A:** The soup is boiling hot and has a temperature of 100 °C, whereas
the water in the tub is just comfortably warm, with a temperature of
about 38 °C. Although the water in the tub has a much lower temperature,
it has greater thermal energy.

</div>

The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the
particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher
temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater
than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many
more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the
water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average
kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater
thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some
other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive
animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.”

**Q:** Could a block of ice have more thermal energy than a pot of

**A:** Yes, the block of ice could have more thermal energy if its mass
was much greater than the mass of the boiling water.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-a5i}

-   The total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter is called
    thermal energy.
-   The thermal energy of matter depends on how fast its particles are
    moving on average, which is measured by temperature, and also on how
    many particles there are, which is measured by mass.

This boy has a fever, and it makes him feel miserable. He feels achy and
really tired. He also feels hot because his temperature is higher than
normal. He has a thermometer in his mouth to measure his temperature.

### What Is Temperature? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBUZW1wZXJhdHVyZT8._10-gei}

No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might
say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics,
**temperature** is defined as the average kinetic energy of the
particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they
have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher
temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they
have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With
a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.

### How a Thermometer Measures Temperature {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgVGhlcm1vbWV0ZXIgTWVhc3VyZXMgVGVtcGVyYXR1cmU._10-nsr}

Many thermometers measure temperature with a liquid that expands when it
gets warmer and contracts when it gets cooler. Look at the common
household thermometer pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGhlcm1vbWV0ZXI.) . The red liquid rises
or falls in the glass tube as the temperature changes. Temperature is
read off the scale at the height of the liquid in the tube. To learn
more about measuring temperature, watch the animation “Measuring
Temperature” at this URL:

![Illustration of a

**Figure 6.28**

</div>

**Q:** Why does the liquid in the thermometer expand and contract when
temperature changes?

**A:** When the temperature is higher, particles of the liquid have
greater kinetic energy, so they move about more and spread apart. This
causes the liquid to expand. The opposite happens when the temperature
is lower and particles of liquid have less kinetic energy. The particles
move less and crowd closer together, causing the liquid to contract.

### Temperature Scales {#6.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgU2NhbGVz_10-jgd}

The thermometer pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGhlcm1vbWV0ZXI.) measures temperature on
two different scales: Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F). Although some
scientists use the Celsius scale, the SI scale for measuring temperature
is the **Kelvin scale** . If you live in the U.S., you are probably most
familiar with the Fahrenheit scale. The **Table**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmVTY2FsZXM.) compares all three
temperature scales. Each scale uses as reference points the freezing and
boiling points of water. Notice that temperatures on the Kelvin scale
are not given in degrees (°).

  **Scale**    **Freezing Point of Water**   **Boiling Point of Water**
  ------------ ----------------------------- ----------------------------
  Kelvin       273 K                         373 K
  Celsius      0 °C                          100 °C
  Fahrenheit   32 °F                         212 °F

Because all three temperature scales are frequently used, it’s useful to
know how to convert temperatures from one scale to another. It’s easy to
convert temperatures between the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Each
1-degree change on the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the
Celsius scale. Therefore, to convert a temperature from Celsius to
Kelvin, just add 273 to the Celsius temperature. For example, 10 °C
equals 283 Kelvin.

**Q:** How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius?

**A:** You would subtract 273 from the Kelvin temperature. For example,
a temperature of 300 Kevin equals 27 °C.

Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated. The
following conversion factors can be used:

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-ivb}

-   Temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles of matter.
-   A thermometer can measure temperature with a liquid that expands
    when it gets warmer and contracts when it gets cooler
-   The SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale. Celsius
    and Fahrenheit temperature scales are also commonly used. You can
    use conversion factors to convert temperatures between the
    different scales.

This chef is taking corn bread out of a hot oven. What happened to the
batter when it was put in the oven? Did the hot oven add “heat energy”
to the batter? Not exactly. Contrary to popular belief, heat is not a
form of energy.

### What Is Heat? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBIZWF0Pw.._11-qvl}

**Heat** is the transfer of thermal energy between substances. Thermal
energy is the kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, measured by
their temperature. Thermal energy always moves from matter with greater
thermal energy to matter with less thermal energy, so it moves from
warmer to cooler substances. You can see this in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGVtcGVyYXR1cmU.) . Faster-moving
particles of the warmer substance bump into and transfer some of their
energy to slower-moving particles of the cooler substance. Thermal
energy is transferred in this way until both substances have the same
thermal energy and temperature. For a visual introduction to these
concepts, watch the animation “Temperature vs. Heat” at this URL:

### Cooling Down by Heating Up {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29vbGluZyBEb3duIGJ5IEhlYXRpbmcgVXA._11-reb}

How do you cool down a glass of room-temperature cola? You probably add
ice cubes to it, as in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29sYQ..) . You might think that the ice
cools down the cola, but in fact, it works the other way around. The
warm cola heats up the ice. Thermal energy from the warm cola is
transferred to the much colder ice, causing it to melt. The cola loses
thermal energy in the process, so its temperature falls.

This girl and her brother are having fun at the beach. It’s a warm,
sunny day, and the sand feels hot on their bare feet. They take a dip in
the water whenever they want to cool off because the water feels much
cooler than the sand. Why does the sand—but not the water—get hot in the
sun? The answer has to do with specific heat.

### Be Specific {#6.html#x-ck12-QmUgU3BlY2lmaWM._12-stb}

**Specific heat** is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the
temperature of a substance. It is the amount of energy (in joules)
needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 °C.
Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter.
That’s why it’s called *specific* .

### Variation in Specific Heat {#6.html#x-ck12-VmFyaWF0aW9uIGluIFNwZWNpZmljIEhlYXQ._12-0rb}

The **Table** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlY2lmaWNIZWF0U3Vic3RhbmNlcw..)
compares the specific heat of four different substances. Metals such as
iron have low specific heat. It doesn’t take much energy to raise their
temperature. That’s why a metal spoon heats up quickly when placed in a
cup of hot coffee. Sand also has a relatively low specific heat. Water,
on the other hand, has a very high specific heat. It takes a lot more
energy to increase the temperature of water than sand. This explains why
the sand on a beach gets hot while the water stays cool. Differences in
the specific heat of water and land even affect climate. To learn how,
watch the video at this URL:

  **Substance**   **Specific Heat (joules)**
  --------------- ----------------------------

  sand            0.67
  wood            1.76
  water           4.18

**Q:** Metal cooking pots and pans often have wooden handles. Can you
explain why?

**A:** Wood has a higher specific heat than metal, so it takes more
energy to heat a wooden handle than a metal handle. As a result, a
wooden handle would heat up more slowly and be less likely to burn your
hand when you touch it.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-89e}

-   Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the
    temperature of a substance. It is the amount of energy (in joules)
    needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1 °C.
-   Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of

Yummy! These cookies look delicious. But watch out! They just finished
baking in a hot oven, so the cookie sheet is too hot to handle without
an oven mitt. Touching the cookie sheet with bare hands could cause a
painful burn. Do you know why? The answer is conduction.

### What Is Conduction? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBDb25kdWN0aW9uPw.._13-gs1}

**Conduction** is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of
matter that are touching. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of
moving particles of matter, and the transfer of thermal energy is called
heat. Conduction is one of three ways that thermal energy can be
transferred (the other ways are convection and thermal radiation).
Thermal energy is always transferred from matter with a higher
temperature to matter with a lower temperature.

### Pass It On {#6.html#x-ck12-UGFzcyBJdCBPbg.._13-e6g}

To understand how conduction works, you need to think about the tiny
particles that make up matter. The particles of all matter are in
constant random motion, but the particles of warmer matter have more
energy and move more quickly than the particles of cooler matter. When
particles of warmer matter collide with particles of cooler matter, they
transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles. From
particle to particle, like dominoes falling, thermal energy moves
through matter. Click on the animation “Conduction” at this URL to see
an animation of conduction:

[http://www.hk-phy.org/contextual/heat/hea/condu/conduction\_e.html](conduction_e.html)

In the opening photo above, conduction occurs between particles of metal
in the cookie sheet and anything cooler that comes into contact with
it—hopefully, not someone’s bare hands! For a deeper understanding of
this method of heat transfer, watch the animation “Conduction” at this
URL:

### Examples of Conduction {#6.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgQ29uZHVjdGlvbg.._13-v5j}

The cookie sheet in the opening image transfers thermal energy to the
cookies and helps them bake. There are many other common examples of
conduction. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29uZHVjdGlvbg..) shows a few situations
in which thermal energy is transferred in this way.

a cup of hot cocoa feels good when you have cold hands. Camp Stove: This
camp stove can be used to cook food in a small pot. Snow: Ouch! Can you

</div>

**Q:** How is thermal energy transferred in each of the situations
pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29uZHVjdGlvbg..) ?

**A:** Thermal energy is transferred by conduction from the hot iron to
the shirt, from the hot cup to the hand holding it, from the flame of
the camp stove to the bottom of the pot as well as from the bottom of
the pot to the food inside, and from the feet to the snow. The shirt,
hand, pot, food, and snow become warmer because of the transferred
energy. Because the feet lose thermal energy, they feel colder.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-iy1}

-   Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of
    matter that are touching. Thermal energy is always transferred from
    particles of warmer matter to particles of cooler matter.

Do you see the water bubbling in this pot? The water is boiling hot. How
does all of the water in the pot get hot when it is heated only from the
bottom by the gas flame? The answer is convection.

### Defining Convection {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgQ29udmVjdGlvbg.._14-dfv}

**Convection** is the transfer of thermal energy by particles moving
through a fluid (either a gas or a liquid). Thermal energy is the total
kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and the transfer of
thermal energy is called heat. Convection is one of three ways that
thermal energy can be transferred (the other ways are conduction and
thermal radiation). Thermal energy is always transferred from matter
with a higher temperature to matter with a lower temperature.

### How Does Convection Occur? {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvZXMgQ29udmVjdGlvbiBPY2N1cj8._14-rnh}

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm9pbGluZ1BvdA..) shows
how convection occurs, using hot water in a pot as an example. When
particles in one area of a fluid (in this case, the water at the bottom
of the pot) gain thermal energy, they move more quickly, have more
collisions, and spread farther apart. This decreases the density of the
particles, so they rise up through the fluid. As they rise, they
transfer their thermal energy to other particles of the fluid and cool
off in the process. With less energy, the particles move more slowly,
have fewer collisions, and move closer together. This increases their
density, so they sink back down through the fluid. When they reach the
bottom of the fluid, the cycle repeats. The result is a loop of moving
particles called a **convection current** . You can learn more about
convection currents by watching the cartoon video called “Convection” at
this URL: [http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/3](3)

</div>

### Examples of Convection {#6.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgQ29udmVjdGlvbg.._14-bu0}

Convection currents transfer thermal energy through many fluids, not
just hot water in a pot. For example, convection currents transfer
thermal energy through molten rock below Earth’s surface, through water
in the oceans, and through air in the atmosphere. Convection currents in
the atmosphere create winds. You can see one way this happens in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT2NlYW5Db252ZWN0aW9u) . The
land heats up and cools off faster than the water because it has lower
specific heat. Therefore, the land gets warmer during the day and cooler
at night than the water does. During the day, warm air rises above the
land and cool air from the water moves in to take its place. During the
night, the opposite happens. Warm air rises above the water and cool air
from the land moves out to take its place.

**Q:** During the day, in which direction is thermal energy of the air
transferred? In which direction is it transferred during the night?

**A:** During the day, thermal energy is transferred from the air over
the land to the air over the water. During the night, thermal energy is
transferred in the opposite direction.

Someone is warming his hands over a bonfire. He doesn’t have to touch
the fire to feel its warmth. How is warmth from the fire transferred to
his hands? In this article, you’ll find out.

### Introducing Thermal Radiation {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgVGhlcm1hbCBSYWRpYXRpb24._15-kub}

The bonfire from the opening image has a lot of thermal energy. Thermal
energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter, and
the transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Thermal energy from the
bonfire is transferred to the hands by thermal radiation. **Thermal
radiation** is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that can travel
through air or even through empty space, as shown in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8yXzdfUmFkaWF0aW9u) . When the waves of
thermal energy reach objects, they transfer the energy to the objects,
causing them to warm up. This is how the fire warms the hands of someone
sitting near the bonfire. This is also how the sun’s energy reaches

Thermal radiation is one of three ways that thermal energy can be
transferred. The other two ways are conduction and convection, both of
which need matter to transfer energy. Radiation is the only way of
transferring thermal energy that doesn’t require matter. To learn more
about thermal radiation, watch “Radiation” at the URL below.

### Sources of Thermal Radiation {#6.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBUaGVybWFsIFJhZGlhdGlvbg.._15-jfa}

You might be surprised to learn that everything radiates thermal energy,
not just really hot things such as the sun or a fire. For example, when
it’s cold outside, a heated home radiates some of its thermal energy
into the outdoor environment. A home that is poorly insulated radiates
more energy than a home that is well insulated. Special cameras can be
used to detect radiated heat. In the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGhlcm1hbEhvdXNl) , you can see an image
created by one of these cameras. The areas that are yellow are the areas
where the greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the home.
Even people radiate thermal energy. In fact, when a room is full of
people, it may feel noticeably warmer because of all the thermal energy
the people radiate!

**Q:** Where is thermal radiation radiating from the home in the
picture?

**A:** The greatest amount of thermal energy is radiating from the
window on the upper left. A lot of thermal energy is also radiating from
the edges of the windows and door.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-9so}

-   Thermal radiation is the transfer of thermal energy by waves that
    can travel through air or even through empty space. This is how
    thermal energy from a fire is transferred to your hands and how
    thermal energy from the sun is transferred to Earth.
-   Everything radiates thermal energy, even objects that aren’t
    very warm.

Do you like toast? Did you ever look inside a toaster while it’s
toasting bread? When you push down the lever to turn on the toaster, the
metal heating element inside starts to glow orange or red almost
instantly. You can see the glowing heating element inside this yellow
toaster. The glowing metal shows that the heating element has become
very hot. It gets hot so quickly because metals are good conductors of
thermal energy.

### Thermal Conductors {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlcm1hbCBDb25kdWN0b3Jz_16-5zs}

Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter
that are touching. Thermal conduction occurs when particles of warmer
matter bump into particles of cooler matter and transfer some of their
thermal energy to the cooler particles. Conduction is usually faster in
certain solids and liquids than in gases. Materials that are good
conductors of thermal energy are called **thermal conductors** . Metals
are especially good thermal conductors because they have freely moving
electrons that can transfer thermal energy quickly and easily.

Besides the heating element inside a toaster, another example of a
thermal conductor is a metal radiator, like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGVhdGVy) . When hot water flows through
the coils of the radiator, the metal quickly heats up by conduction and
then radiates thermal energy into the surrounding air.

**Q:** Thermal conductors have many uses, but sometimes it’s important
to prevent the transfer of thermal energy. Can you think of an example?

**A:** One example is staying warm on a cold day. You will stay warmer
if you can prevent the transfer of your own thermal energy to the
outside air.

### Thermal Insulators {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlcm1hbCBJbnN1bGF0b3Jz_16-tpf}

One way to retain your own thermal energy on a cold day is to wear
clothes that trap air. That’s because air, like other gases, is a poor
conductor of thermal energy. The particles of gases are relatively far
apart, so they don’t bump into each other or into other things as often
as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids. Therefore,
particles of gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy.
Materials that are poor thermal conductors are called **thermal
insulators** . Down-filled snowsuits, like those in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRG93bmZlYXRoZXJz) , are good thermal
insulators because their feather filling traps a lot of air.

Another example of a thermal insulator is pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSG9tZUluc3VsYXRpb24.) . The picture shows
fluffy pink insulation inside the attic of a home. Like the down filling
in a snowsuit, the insulation traps a lot of air. The insulation helps
to prevent the transfer of thermal energy into the house on hot days and
out of the house on cold days. Other materials that are thermal
insulators include plastic and wood. That’s why pot handles and cooking
utensils are often made of these materials. Notice that the outside of
the toaster pictured in the opening image is made of plastic. The
plastic casing helps prevent the transfer of thermal energy from the
heating element inside to the outer surface of the toaster where it
could cause burns. You can learn more about thermal insulators at this

A roaring blaze in a fireplace is a good way to keep toes toasty on a
cold winter day. But you probably wouldn’t use a fireplace to heat an
entire house. Do you know how your home is heated?

### Heating the Home {#6.html#x-ck12-SGVhdGluZyB0aGUgSG9tZQ.._17-fr4}

Modern home heating systems keep us comfortable in cold weather. We may
even depend on them for our survival. But we often take them for
granted. Two common types of home heating systems are hot-water and
warm-air heating systems. Both types are described below. You can watch
an animation showing how a solar heating system works at the following
URL.

[http://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/AP%20Environmental%20Science/course%20files/multimedia/lesson67/animations/4e\_solar\_heating\_system.html](4e_solar_heating_system.html)

Thermal energy is the total energy of moving particles of matter. The
transfer of thermal energy is called heat. Therefore, a heating system
is a system for the transfer of thermal energy. Regardless of the type
of heating system in a home, the basic function is the same: to produce
thermal energy and transfer it to air throughout the house.

### Hot-Water Heating System {#6.html#x-ck12-SG90LVdhdGVyIEhlYXRpbmcgU3lzdGVt_17-ow6}

A hot-water heating system produces thermal energy to heat water and
then pumps the hot water throughout the building in a system of pipes
and radiators. You can see a simple diagram of this type of heating
system in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2FybVdhdGVy) .

-   Water is heated in a boiler that burns a fuel such as natural gas or
    heating oil. The boiler converts the chemical energy stored in the
    fuel to thermal energy.
-   The heated water is pumped from the boiler through pipes and
    radiators throughout the house. There is usually a radiator in
    each room. The radiators get warm when the hot water flows
    through them.
-   The warm radiators radiate thermal energy to the air around them.
    The warm air then circulates throughout the rooms in
    convection currents.
-   The hot water cools as it flows through the system and transfers its
    thermal energy. When it finally returns to the boiler, it is heated
    again and the cycle repeats.

system](ck12_6_files/20150911012810670215.png "Schematic of a warm water heating system")

**Figure 6.40**

</div>

**Q:** Look closely at the hot-water heating system in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2FybVdhdGVy) . The radiator is a coiled
pipe through which hot water flows. What happens to the water as it
flows through the radiator? Why is each radiator connected to two pipes?
Why can’t water flow directly from one radiator to another through a
single pipe?

**A:** The radiator is where most of the energy transfer occurs. Water
passes through such a great length of pipe in the radiator that it
transfers a lot of thermal energy to the radiator. As the water
transfers thermal energy, it gets cooler. The cool water flows into a
return pipe rather than going directly to another radiator because the
cool water no longer has enough thermal energy to heat a room.

### Warm-Air Heating System {#6.html#x-ck12-V2FybS1BaXIgSGVhdGluZyBTeXN0ZW0._17-0pl}

A warm-air heating system uses thermal energy to heat air and then
forces the warm air through a system of ducts and registers. You can see
a this type of heating system in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2FybUFpcg..) .

-   The air is heated in a furnace that burns fuel such as natural gas,
    propane, or heating oil.
-   After the air gets warm, a fan blows it through the ducts and out
    through the registers that are located in each room.
-   Warm air blowing out of a register moves across the room, pushing
    cold air out of the way.
-   The cold air enters a return register across the room and returns to
    the furnace with the help of another fan.
-   In the furnace, the cold air is heated, and the cycle repeats.

**Q:** How does a home heating system “know” when to run and when to
stop running?

**A:** A home heating system is turned on or off by a thermostat.

### How a Thermostat Works {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgVGhlcm1vc3RhdCBXb3Jrcw.._17-hxg}

A **thermostat** , like the one seen in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGhlcm1vc3RhdA..) , is an important part
of any home heating system. It is like the “brain” of the entire system.
It constantly monitors the temperature in the home and “tells” the
boiler or furnace when to turn on or off. The thermostat is set at a
selected temperature, say 71 °F. When the temperature in the home starts
to fall below this point, the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace
to start running. When the temperature starts to rise above this point,
the thermostat triggers the boiler or furnace to stop running. In this
way, the thermostat maintains the home’s temperature at the set point.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-vcp}

-   Types of home heating systems include hot-water, warm-air, and solar
    heating systems. All of them have the same basic function: producing
    thermal energy and transferring it to air throughout the house.
-   A hot-water heating system burns fuel in a boiler to produce
    thermal energy. The thermal energy is used to heat water, which is
    pumped through a system of pipes and radiators.
-   A warm-air heating system burns fuel in a furnace to produce
    thermal energy. The thermal energy is used to heat air, which is

A refrigerator door makes a great message center. Its smooth metal
surface is perfect for sticky notes and magnets. In most homes, a
refrigerator is one of the hardest working appliances, but not just
because it holds messages. Unlike most other home appliances, a
refrigerator generally runs nonstop every day of the year. Can you think
of another home appliance that gets such constant use?

### Purpose of a Cooling System {#6.html#x-ck12-UHVycG9zZSBvZiBhIENvb2xpbmcgU3lzdGVt_18-0sl}

A refrigerator is an example of a cooling system. Another example is an
air conditioner. The purpose of any cooling system is to transfer
thermal energy in order to keep things cool. A refrigerator, for
example, transfers thermal energy from the cool air inside the
refrigerator to the warm air in the kitchen. If you’ve ever noticed how
warm the back of a running refrigerator gets, then you know that it
releases a lot of thermal energy into the room.

**Q:** Thermal energy always moves from a warmer area to a cooler area.
How can thermal energy move from the cooler air inside a refrigerator to
the warmer air in a room?

**A:** The answer is work.

### How a Refrigerator Works {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgUmVmcmlnZXJhdG9yIFdvcmtz_18-j2r}

A refrigerator must do work to reverse the normal direction of thermal
energy flow. Work involves the use of force to move something, and doing
work takes energy. In a refrigerator, the energy is usually provided by
electricity. You can read in detail in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVmcmlnZXJhdG9y) how a refrigerator does
its work. For an animation of how a refrigerator works, go to this URL:
[http://www.chemistry.wustl.edu/\~edudev/LabTutorials/CourseTutorials/LabTutorials/Thermochem/fridge\_movie.html](fridge_movie.html)

### The Refrigerant {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJlZnJpZ2VyYW50_18-gnx}

The key to how a refrigerator or other cooling system works is the
refrigerant. A **refrigerant** is a substance such as Freon™ that has a
low boiling point and changes between liquid and gaseous states as it
passes through the refrigerator. As a liquid, the refrigerant absorbs
thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator and changes to
a gas. As a gas, it transfers thermal energy to the warm air outside the
refrigerator and changes back to a liquid. Work is done by a
refrigerator to move the refrigerant through the different components of
the refrigerator.

one of his inventions. The man and woman were on their way to the top of
Mount Washington, the highest mountain in the eastern U.S. The purpose
of the trip up the mountain was to get publicity for the steam-powered
automobile. The inventor and his wife were the first people to ever
reach the top of the mountain by car. Steam engines are not used very
much anymore, because more efficient and powerful engines have been
developed. But inventors and engineers learned a lot from these early
combustion engines.

**Q:** How else were steam engines used?

**A:** Starting in the 1700s and up until the early 1900s, steam engines
were commonly used to run factory machines, train locomotives, and
ships. Their power led to a revolution in industry and transportation.

### What Is a Combustion Engine? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIENvbWJ1c3Rpb24gRW5naW5lPw.._19-rmf}

A **combustion engine** is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce
thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work. There are
two types of combustion engines: external and internal. A steam engine
is an external combustion engine.

### How an External Combustion Engine Works {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGFuIEV4dGVybmFsIENvbWJ1c3Rpb24gRW5naW5lIFdvcmtz_19-qqv}

An **external combustion engine** burns fuel externally, or outside the
engine. The burning fuel releases thermal energy, which is used to heat
water and change it to steam. The pressure of the steam moves a piston
back and forth inside a cylinder. The kinetic energy of the moving
piston can be used to turn a vehicle’s wheels, a turbine, or other
mechanical device. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXh0ZXJuYWxDb21idXN0aW9u) explains in
greater detail how this type of engine works. You can see an animated
external combustion engine at this URL:

**Q:** What type of energy does the piston have when it moves back and
forth inside the cylinder?

**A:** Like anything else that is moving, the moving piston has kinetic
energy.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-tag}

-   A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce
    thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work.
-   An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside
    the engine.
-   An external combustion engine burns fuel to heat water and
    produce steam. The steam is under pressure and is used to push a
    piston back and forth inside a cylinder. As the piston moves back
    and forth, it moves a piston rod, which can do work.

This racecar isn’t really burning up the road. The flames were added to
show that the car is zooming down the road at a high rate of speed. A
racecar can move so fast because it has a powerful combustion engine.  

### Introducing Combustion Engines {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgQ29tYnVzdGlvbiBFbmdpbmVz_20-1cj}

A **combustion engine** is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce
thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work. In a car, the engine
does the work of providing kinetic energy that turns the wheels. The
combustion engine in a car is a type of engine called an internal
combustion engine. (Another type of combustion engine is an external
combustion engine.)

### How an Internal Combustion Engine Works {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGFuIEludGVybmFsIENvbWJ1c3Rpb24gRW5naW5lIFdvcmtz_20-cmd}

An **internal combustion engine** burns fuel internally, or inside the
engine. This type of engine is found not only in cars but in most other
motor vehicles as well. The engine works in a series of steps, which
keep repeating. You can follow the steps in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29tYnVzdGlvbkVuZ2luZQ..) .

1.  A mixture of fuel and air is pulled-into a cylinder through a valve,
    which then closes.
2.  A piston inside the cylinder moves upward, compressing the fuel-air
    mixture in the closed cylinder. The mixture is now under a lot of
    pressure and very warm.
3.  A spark from a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture, causing it
    to burn explosively within the confined space of the
    closed cylinder.
4.  The pressure of the hot gases from combustion pushes the
    piston downward.
5.  The piston moves up again, pushing exhaust gases out of the cylinder
    through another valve.
6.  The piston moves downward again, and the cycle repeats.

**Q:** The internal combustion engine converts thermal energy to another
form of energy. Which form of energy is it?

**A:** The engine converts thermal energy to kinetic energy, or the
energy of a moving object—in this case, the moving piston.

### How Energy from the Engine Turns the Wheels {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVuZXJneSBmcm9tIHRoZSBFbmdpbmUgVHVybnMgdGhlIFdoZWVscw.._20-vfs}

In a car, the piston in the engine is connected by the piston rod to the
crankshaft. The crankshaft rotates when the piston moves up and down.
The crankshaft, in turn, is connected to the driveshaft. When the
crankshaft rotates, so does the driveshaft. The rotating driveshaft
turns the wheels of the car.

### How Many Cylinders? {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1hbnkgQ3lsaW5kZXJzPw.._20-jmr}

Most cars have at least four cylinders connected to the crankshaft.
Their pistons move up and down in sequence, one after the other. A
powerful car may have eight pistons, and some racecars may have even
more. The more cylinders a car engine has, the more powerful its engine
can be.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-asy}

-   A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce
    thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work. An internal
    combustion engine burns fuel internally, or inside the engine.
-   In an internal combustion engine, a mixture of fuel and air is
    burned in a closed cylinder, forcing a piston to move up and down.
-   In a car, the moving piston rotates a crankshaft, which turns
    a driveshaft. The turning driveshaft causes the wheels of the car
    to turn.

No doubt you’ve seen this happen. Droplets of water fall into a body of
water, and concentric circles spread out through the water around the
droplets. The concentric circles are waves moving through the water.

### Waves in Matter {#6.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZXMgaW4gTWF0dGVy_21-tjs}

The waves in the picture above are examples of mechanical waves. A
**mechanical wave** is a disturbance in matter that transfers energy
through the matter. A mechanical wave starts when matter is disturbed. A
source of energy is needed to disturb matter and start a mechanical
wave.

**Q:** Where does the energy come from in the water wave pictured above?

**A:** The energy comes from the falling droplets of water, which have
kinetic energy because of their motion.

### The Medium {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1lZGl1bQ.._21-twu}

The energy of a mechanical wave can travel only through matter. The
matter through which the wave travels is called the **medium** (
*plural* , media). The medium in the water wave pictured above is water,
a liquid. But the medium of a mechanical wave can be any state of
matter, even a solid.

**Q:** How do the particles of the medium move when a wave passes
through them?

**A:** The particles of the medium just vibrate in place. As they
vibrate, they pass the energy of the disturbance to the particles next
to them, which pass the energy to the particles next to them, and so on.
Particles of the medium don’t actually travel along with the wave. Only
the energy of the wave travels through the medium.

### Types of Mechanical Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTWVjaGFuaWNhbCBXYXZlcw.._21-mk5}

There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse, longitudinal, and
surface waves. They differ in how particles of the medium move. You can
see this in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8zXzFfd2F2ZXM.) and in the animation at
the following URL.

waves](ck12_6_files/20150911012812100255.png "Diagram illustrating transverse, longitudinal, and surface waves")

**Figure 6.46**

</div>

-   In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down
    perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
-   In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate back and
    forth parallel to the direction of the wave.
-   In a surface wave, particles of the medium vibrate both up and down
    and back and forth, so they end up moving in a circle.

**Q:** How do you think surface waves are related to transverse and
longitudinal waves?

**A:** A surface wave is combination of a transverse wave and a
longitudinal wave.

Can you guess what this picture shows? Here’s a hint: the objects in the
picture have been magnified, and one of them is moving rapidly. The
objects are guitar strings, and the moving string is the one on the
bottom right. The string is moving because it has just been plucked.
Plucking the string gave it energy, which is moving through the string
in a mechanical wave. A mechanical wave is a wave that travels through
matter. The matter a mechanical wave travels through is called the
medium. The type of mechanical wave passing through the vibrating guitar
string is a transverse wave.

### What Is a Transverse Wave? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIFRyYW5zdmVyc2UgV2F2ZT8._22-z9i}

A **transverse wave** is a wave in which particles of the medium vibrate
at right angles, or perpendicular, to the direction that the wave
travels. Another example of a transverse wave is the wave that passes
through a rope with you shake one end of the rope up and down, as in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGFuZHJvcGU.) . The direction
of the wave is down the length of the rope away from the hand. The rope
itself moves up and down as the wave passes through it. You can watch a
video of a transverse wave in a rope at this URL:

**Q:** When a guitar string is plucked, in what direction does the wave
travel? In what directions does the string vibrate?

**A:** The wave travels down the string to the end. The string vibrates
up and down at right angles to the direction of the wave.

### Crests and Troughs {#6.html#x-ck12-Q3Jlc3RzIGFuZCBUcm91Z2hz_22-js4}

A transverse wave is characterized by the high and low points reached by
particles of the medium as the wave passes through. The high points are
called crests, and the low points are called troughs. You can see both
in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8zXzJfdHJhbnN2ZXJzZQ..) .

You’ve probably played with Slinky spring toys like these. They’re
simple toys, but they can move in very interesting ways. Pushing in on
the end of a spring toy, for example, gives it energy that moves through
the spring in a longitudinal wave.

### What Is a Longitudinal Wave? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIExvbmdpdHVkaW5hbCBXYXZlPw.._23-hvx}

A **longitudinal wave** is a type of mechanical wave. A mechanical wave
is a wave that travels through matter, called the medium. In a
longitudinal wave, particles of the medium vibrate in a direction that
is parallel to the direction that the wave travels. You can see this in
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTG9uZ2l0dWRpbmFsV2F2ZQ..)
. The person’s hand pushes and pulls on one end of the spring. The
energy of this disturbance passes through the coils of the spring to the
other end. You can see a video of a longitudinal wave in a spring at

### Compressions and Rarefactions {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29tcHJlc3Npb25zIGFuZCBSYXJlZmFjdGlvbnM._23-oxf}

Notice in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTG9uZ2l0dWRpbmFsV2F2ZQ..) that the coils
of the spring first crowd closer together and then spread farther apart
as the wave passes through them. Places where particles of a medium
crowd closer together are called compressions, and places where the
particles spread farther apart are called rarefactions. The more energy
the wave has, the closer together the particles are in compressions and
the farther apart they are in rarefactions.

### P Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-UCBXYXZlcw.._23-uoi}

Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves called P waves. The disturbance
that causes an earthquake sends longitudinal waves through underground
rocks in all directions away from the disturbance. P waves are modeled
in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUFdhdmVz) .

**Q:** Where are the compressions and rarefactions of the medium in this

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._23-zau}

-   A longitudinal wave is a type of mechanical wave, or wave that
    travels through matter, called the medium. In a longitudinal wave,
    particles of the medium vibrate in a direction that is parallel to
    the direction that the wave travels.
-   Places where particles of the medium crowd closer together are
    called compressions. Places where particles of the medium spread
    farther apart are called rarefactions.
-   Earthquakes cause longitudinal waves called P waves, which pass
    through underground rocks.

This immense wall of moving water gives the surfer an amazing ride. The
swelling surf raises him up and pushes him forward as though he’s as
light as a feather. All he needs to do is keep his balance on the
surfboard. The incredible power of the wave will do the rest. Ocean
waves like this one are examples of surface waves.

### Waves on the Surface {#6.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZXMgb24gdGhlIFN1cmZhY2U._24-9nb}

A **surface wave** is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium.
The medium is the matter through which the wave travels. Ocean waves are
the best-known examples of surface waves. They travel on the surface of
the water between the ocean and the air.

**Q:** What do you think causes ocean waves?

**A:** Most ocean waves are caused by wind blowing across the water.
Moving air molecules transfer some of their energy to molecules of ocean
water. The energy travels across the surface of the water in waves. The
stronger the winds are blowing, the larger the waves are and the more
energy they have.

### How the Medium Moves {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IHRoZSBNZWRpdW0gTW92ZXM._24-gae}

A surface wave is a combination of a transverse wave and a longitudinal
wave. A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move
up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave. A longitudinal
wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move parallel to the
direction of the wave. In a surface wave, particles of the medium move
up and down as well as back and forth. This gives them an overall
circular motion. You can see how the particles move in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGFydGljbGVXYXZlcw..) and at this URL:

### Why Waves Break {#6.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFdhdmVzIEJyZWFr_24-kgo}

In deep water, particles of water just move in circles. They don’t
actually move closer to shore with the energy of the waves. However,
near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently.
Look at the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQnJlYWtpbmdXYXZl)
. You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow
water. This creates friction that slows down the bottoms of the waves,
while the tops of the waves keep moving at the same speed. The
difference in speed causes the waves to get steeper until they topple
over and break. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.

**Q:** In this diagram of a wave breaking near shore, where do you think
a surfer would try to catch the wave?

**A:** The surfer would try to catch the wave where it starts to steepen

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-szg}

-   A surface wave is a wave that travels along the surface of a medium.
    Ocean waves are the best-known examples of surface waves.
-   In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well
    as back and forth in an overall circular motion. The particles don’t
    actually move closer to shore as the waves pass through.
-   In shallow water close to shore, waves start to drag on the bottom
    of the water. The bottoms—but not the tops—of the wave slow down
    because of friction. This causes the waves to steepen until they
    break and fall over, carrying water onto the shore as surf.

On a windy day, moving air particles strike these flags and transfer
their energy of motion to particles of fabric. The energy travels
through the fabric in waves. You can see the waves rippling through the
brightly colored cloth. The windier the day is, the more vigorously the
flags wave.

### What’s the Matter? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgdGhlIE1hdHRlcj8._25-g9w}

Waves that travel through matter—such as the fabric of a flag—are called
mechanical waves. The matter they travel through is called the medium.
When the energy of a wave passes through the medium, particles of the
medium move. The more energy the wave has, the farther the particles of
the medium move. The distance the particles move is measured by the
wave’s amplitude.

### What Is Wave Amplitude? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBXYXZlIEFtcGxpdHVkZT8._25-yg8}

**Wave amplitude** is the maximum distance the particles of the medium
move from their resting positions when a wave passes through. The
resting position of a particle of the medium is where the particle would
be in the absence of a wave. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8zXzVfd2F2ZXM.) show the amplitudes of
two different types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves.

-   In a transverse wave, particles of the medium move up and down at
    right angles to the direction of the wave. Wave amplitude of a
    transverse wave is the difference in height between the crest and
    the resting position. The crest is the highest point particles of
    the medium reach. The higher the crests are, the greater the
    amplitude of the wave.
-   In a longitudinal wave, particles of the medium move back and forth
    in the same direction as the wave. Wave amplitude of a longitudinal
    wave is the distance between particles of the medium where it is
    compressed by the wave. The closer together the particles are, the
    greater the amplitude of the wave.

**Q:** What do you think determines a wave’s amplitude?

**A:** Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance
that causes the wave.

### Energy and Amplitude {#6.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IGFuZCBBbXBsaXR1ZGU._25-qvg}

A wave caused by a disturbance with more energy has greater amplitude.
Imagine dropping a small pebble into a pond of still water. Tiny ripples
will move out from the disturbance in concentric circles. The ripples
are low-amplitude waves with very little energy. Now imagine throwing a
big boulder into the pond. Very large waves will be generated by the
disturbance. These waves are high-amplitude waves and have a great deal
of energy.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-qlr}

-   Wave amplitude is the maximum distance the particles of the medium
    move from their resting positions when a wave passes through.
-   Wave amplitude of a transverse wave is the difference in height
    between a crest and the resting position. Wave amplitude of a
    longitudinal wave is the distance between particles of the medium
    where it is compressed by the wave.
-   Wave amplitude is determined by the energy of the disturbance that

Nobody really has such colorful eyes! The colors were added digitally
after the photo was taken. They represent all the different colors of
light. Light is a form of energy that travels in waves. Light of
different colors has different wavelengths.

### Defining Wavelength {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgV2F2ZWxlbmd0aA.._26-jz5}

**Wavelength** is one way of measuring the size of waves. It is the
distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves, and it is
usually measured in meters. How it is measured is a little different for
transverse and longitudinal waves.

-   In a transverse wave, particles of the medium vibrate up and down at
    right angles to the direction that the wave travels. The wavelength
    of a transverse wave can be measured as the distance between two
    adjacent crests, or high points, as shown in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8zXzZfVHJhbnN2ZXJzZQ..) .

The wavelength of a wave is related to the wave’s energy.
Short-wavelength waves have more energy than long-wavelength waves of
the same amplitude. (Amplitude is a measure of how far particles of the
medium move up and down or back and forth when a wave passes through
them.) You can see examples of transverse waves with shorter and longer
wavelengths in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2F2ZXM.) .

Imagine making transverse waves in a rope, like the person in the sketch
above. You tie one end of the rope to a tree or other fixed point, and
then you shake the other end of the rope up and down with your hand. You
can move the rope up and down slowly or quickly. How quickly you move
the rope determines the frequency of the waves.

### What Is Wave Frequency? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBXYXZlIEZyZXF1ZW5jeT8._27-6rj}

The number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time is
**wave frequency** . Wave frequency can be measured by counting the
number of crests (high points) of waves that pass the fixed point in 1
second or some other time period. The higher the number is, the greater
the frequency of the waves. The SI unit for wave frequency is the
**hertz (Hz)** , where 1 hertz equals 1 wave passing a fixed point in 1
second. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJhbnN2ZXJzZVdhdmU.) shows
high-frequency and low-frequency transverse waves. You can simulate

**Q:** The wavelength of a wave is the distance between corresponding
points on adjacent waves. For example, it is the distance between two
adjacent crests in the transverse waves in the diagram. Infer how wave
frequency is related to wavelength.

**A:** Waves with a higher frequency have crests that are closer
together, so higher frequency waves have shorter wavelengths.

### Wave Frequency and Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZSBGcmVxdWVuY3kgYW5kIEVuZXJneQ.._27-rni}

The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations
that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave
in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes
more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a
lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of
different frequencies in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlmZmVyZW50V2F2ZUxlbmd0aHM.) (Amplitude
is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a

Assume that you move one end of a rope up and down just once to generate
a wave in the rope. How long will take the wave to travel down the rope
to the other end? It depends on the speed of the wave.

### The Speed of a Wave {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNwZWVkIG9mIGEgV2F2ZQ.._28-umr}

**Wave speed** is the distance a wave travels in a given amount of time,
such as the number of meters it travels per second. Wave speed (and
speed in general) can be represented by the equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-NDQ4NzdjNmFhOGU5M2ZhNWE5MWM5MzYxMjExNDY0ZmI.-brz">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NDQ4NzdjNmFhOGU5M2ZhNWE5MWM5MzYxMjExNDY0ZmI.-zmb">

### Wave Speed, Wavelength, and Wave Frequency {#6.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZSBTcGVlZCwgV2F2ZWxlbmd0aCwgYW5kIFdhdmUgRnJlcXVlbmN5_28-17h}

Wave speed is related to both wavelength and wave frequency. Wavelength
is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave
frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given
amount of time. This equation shows how the three factors are related:

<dl id="x-ck12-OTVjNTI1MDcxMDAzZGVhOGJmNGY4NjhkMmJiYTY5ZWE.-zf7">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-OTVjNTI1MDcxMDAzZGVhOGJmNGY4NjhkMmJiYTY5ZWE.-gxf">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-OTVjNTI1MDcxMDAzZGVhOGJmNGY4NjhkMmJiYTY5ZWE.-gvl">
<dd>
Speed = Wavelength x Wave Frequency

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
In this equation, wavelength is measured in meters and frequency is
measured in hertz (Hz), or number of waves per second. Therefore, wave
speed is given in meters per second, which is the SI unit for speed.

**Q:** If you increase the wavelength of a wave, does the speed of the
wave increase as well?

**A:** Increasing the wavelength of a wave doesn’t change its speed.
That’s because when wavelength increases, wave frequency decreases. As a
result, the product of wavelength and wave frequency is still the same
speed. At the following URL, you can see what happens to the wavelength
when the frequency of a wave increases.

### Calculating Wave Speed from Wavelength and Wave Frequency {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgV2F2ZSBTcGVlZCBmcm9tIFdhdmVsZW5ndGggYW5kIFdhdmUgRnJlcXVlbmN5_28-lfo}

The equation for wave speed can be used to calculate the speed of a wave
when both wavelength and wave frequency are known. Consider an ocean
wave with a wavelength of 3 meters and a frequency of 1 hertz. The speed
of the wave is:

<dl id="x-ck12-NDE1ZmVlMGUwM2Q4NzY1MGIwYWZmODI3Yzc0NDA1MWQ.-0ca">

<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** Kim made a wave in a spring by pushing and pulling on one end.
The wavelength is 0.1 m, and the wave frequency is 2 hertz. What is the
speed of the wave?

**A:** Substitute these values into the equation for speed:

<dl id="x-ck12-NGMyMTQxZGQ3ODgxODJkNjBhNjM5MTU5OGIzYzY3OTA.-nu5">

<dl id="x-ck12-NGMyMTQxZGQ3ODgxODJkNjBhNjM5MTU5OGIzYzY3OTA.-d29">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NGMyMTQxZGQ3ODgxODJkNjBhNjM5MTU5OGIzYzY3OTA.-29c">
<dd>
Speed = 0.1 m x 2 waves/s = 0.2 m/s

</dd>
</dl>

### Calculating Wave Frequency or Wavelength from Wave Speed {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2FsY3VsYXRpbmcgV2F2ZSBGcmVxdWVuY3kgb3IgV2F2ZWxlbmd0aCBmcm9tIFdhdmUgU3BlZWQ._28-dzj}

The equation for wave speed (above) can be rewritten as:

<dl id="x-ck12-MzFmNzYwYTQ5ZTg1NDM3NDliYjQ1OWU0ZTdkZjcxODc.-hd7">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MzFmNzYwYTQ5ZTg1NDM3NDliYjQ1OWU0ZTdkZjcxODc.-jod">

Frequency =

or Wavelength =

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Therefore, if you know the speed of a wave and either the wavelength or
wave frequency, you can calculate the missing value. For example,
suppose that a wave is traveling at a speed of 2 meters per second and
has a wavelength of 1 meter. Then the frequency of the wave is:

**Q:** A wave is traveling at a speed of 2 m/s and has a frequency of 2

### The Medium Matters {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1lZGl1bSBNYXR0ZXJz_28-tee}

The speed of most waves depends on the medium, or the matter through
which the waves are traveling. Generally, waves travel fastest through
solids and slowest through gases. That’s because particles are closest
together in solids and farthest apart in gases. When particles are
farther apart, it takes longer for the energy of the disturbance to pass
from particle to particle through the medium. At the following URL, you
can watch an animation showing what happens when a wave passes from one
medium to another.

Did you ever hear an echo of your own voice? An echo occurs when sound
waves bounce back from a surface that they can’t pass through. The woman
pictured here is trying to create an echo by shouting toward a large
building. When the sound waves strike the wall of the building, most of
them bounce back toward the woman, and she hears an echo of her voice.
An echo is just one example of how waves interact with matter.

### How Waves Interact with Matter {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IFdhdmVzIEludGVyYWN0IHdpdGggTWF0dGVy_29-63o}

Waves interact with matter in several ways. The interactions occur when
waves pass from one medium to another. The types of interactions are
reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Each type of interaction is
described in detail below. You can see animations of the three types at
this URL:
[http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/schools/teacher/lesson3/flash/whiteboardcomplete.swf](whiteboardcomplete.swf)
.

### Reflection {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVmbGVjdGlvbg.._29-ger}

An echo is an example of wave reflection. **Reflection** occurs when
waves bounce back from a surface they cannot pass through. Reflection
can happen with any type of waves, not just sound waves. For example,
light waves can also be reflected. In fact, that’s how we see most
objects. Light from a light source, such as the sun or a light bulb,
shines on the object and some of the light is reflected. When the
reflected light enters our eyes, we can see the object.

Reflected waves have the same speed and frequency as the original waves
before they were reflected. However, the direction of the reflected
waves is different. When waves strike an obstacle head on, the reflected
waves bounce straight back in the direction they came from. When waves
strike an obstacle at any other angle, they bounce back at the same
angle but in a different direction. This is illustrated in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8zXzlfUmVmbGVjdGlvbg..) . In
this diagram, waves strike a wall at an angle, called the angle of
incidence. The waves are reflected at the same angle, called the angle
of reflection, but in a different direction. Notice that both angles are
measured relative to a line that is perpendicular to the wall.

</div>

### Refraction {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVmcmFjdGlvbg.._29-fyu}

Refraction is another way that waves interact with matter.
**Refraction** occurs when waves bend as they enter a new medium at an
angle. You can see an example of refraction in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV8zXzlfUmVmcmFjdGlvbg..) . Light bends
when it passes from air to water or from water to air. The bending of
the light traveling from the fish to the man’s eyes causes the fish to
appear to be in a different place from where it actually is.

<div id="6.html#x-ck12-YTFjOWE1ZGUzMWZkZTFmMzI0YTRkZDFhNjEwMTgwM2Q.-l1k"

![Diagram illustrating
refraction](ck12_6_files/20150911012815269675.png "Diagram illustrating refraction")

**Figure 6.63**

</div>

Waves bend as they enter a new medium because they start traveling at a
different speed in the new medium. For example, light travels more
slowly in water than in air. This causes it to refract when it passes
from air to water or from water to air.

**Q:** Where would the fish appear to be if the man looked down at it
from straight above its actual location?

**A:** The fish would appear to be where it actually is because
refraction occurs only when waves (in this case light waves from the
fish) enter a new medium at an angle other than 90°.

### Diffraction {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlmZnJhY3Rpb24._29-9r6}

Did you ever notice that you can hear sounds around the corners of
buildings even though you can’t see around them? The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm95U291bmRXYXZlcw..) shows why this
happens. As you can see from the figure, sound waves spread out and
travel around obstacles. This is called **diffraction** . It also occurs
when waves pass through an opening in an obstacle. All waves may be
diffracted, but it is more pronounced in some types of waves than
others. For example, sound waves bend around corners much more than
light does. That’s why you can hear but not see around corners.

For a given type of waves, such as sound waves, how much the waves
diffract depends on the size of the obstacle (or opening in the
obstacle) and the wavelength of the waves. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlmZnJhY3Rpb24.) shows how the amount of
diffraction is affected by the size of the opening in a barrier. Note
that the wavelength of the wave is the distance between the vertical
lines.

When raindrops fall into still water, they create tiny waves that spread
out in all directions away from the drops. What happens when the waves
from two different raindrops meet? They interfere with each other.

### When Waves Meet {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hlbiBXYXZlcyBNZWV0_30-elh}

When two or more waves meet, they interact with each other. The
interaction of waves with other waves is called **wave interference** .
Wave interference may occur when two waves that are traveling in
opposite directions meet. The two waves pass through each other, and
this affects their amplitude. Amplitude is the maximum distance the
particles of the medium move from their resting positions when a wave
passes through. How amplitude is affected by wave interference depends
on the type of interference. Interference can be constructive or
destructive.

### Constructive Interference {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uc3RydWN0aXZlIEludGVyZmVyZW5jZQ.._30-prm}

Constructive interference occurs when the crests, or highest points, of
one wave overlap the crests of the other wave. You can see this in the
**Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29uc3RydWN0aXZlSW50ZXJmZXJlbmNl) . As
the waves pass through each other, the crests combine to produce a wave
with greater amplitude. You can see an animation of constructive
interference at this URL:

### Destructive Interference {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVzdHJ1Y3RpdmUgSW50ZXJmZXJlbmNl_30-oa5}

### Standing Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RhbmRpbmcgV2F2ZXM._30-twe}

Waves may reflect off an obstacle that they are unable to pass through.
When waves are reflected straight back from an obstacle, the reflected
waves interfere with the original waves and create **standing waves** .
These are waves that appear to be standing still. Standing waves occur
because of a combination of constructive and destructive interference.
You can see animations of standing waves at the URLs below.

-   [http://skullsinthestars.com/2008/05/04/classic-science-paper-otto-wieners-experiment-1890/]()
-   [http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/waves/swf.cfm](swf.cfm)

**Q** : How could you use a rope to produce standing waves?

**A** : You could tie one end of the rope to a fixed object, such as
doorknob, and move the other end up and down to generate waves in the
rope. When the waves reach the fixed object, they are reflected back.
The original waves and the reflected waves interfere to produce a
standing wave. Try it yourself and see if the waves appear to stand
still.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-hqx}

-   Wave interference is the interaction of waves with other waves.
-   Constructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap
    the crests of the other wave, causing an increase in wave amplitude.
-   Destructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap
    the troughs of the other wave, causing a decrease in wave amplitude.
-   When waves are reflected straight back from an obstacle, the
    reflected waves interfere with the original waves and create
    standing waves.

make these sounds? This is an old riddle. To answer the riddle
correctly, you need to know the scientific definition of sound.

### Defining Sound {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgU291bmQ._31-rnw}

In science, **sound** is defined as the transfer of energy from a
vibrating object in waves that travel through matter. Most people
commonly use the term sound to mean what they hear when sound waves
enter their ears. The tree above generated sound waves when it fell to
the ground, so it made sound according to the scientific definition. But
the sound wasn’t detected by a person’s ears if there was nobody in the
forest. So the answer to the riddle is both yes and no!

### How Sound Waves Begin {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNvdW5kIFdhdmVzIEJlZ2lu_31-qpn}

All sound waves begin with vibrating matter. Look at the first guitar
string on the left in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR3VpdGFyVmlicmF0aW9ucw..) . Plucking the
string makes it vibrate. The diagram below the figure shows the wave
generated by the vibrating string. The moving string repeatedly pushes
against the air particles next to it, which causes the air particles to
vibrate. The vibrations spread through the air in all directions away
from the guitar string as longitudinal waves. In longitudinal waves,
particles of the medium vibrate back and forth parallel to the direction
that the waves travel. You can see an animation of sound waves traveling
through air at this URL:

**Q:** If there were no air particles to carry the vibrations away from
the guitar string, how would sound reach the ear?

**A:** It wouldn’t unless the vibrations were carried by another medium.
Sound waves are mechanical waves, so they can travel only though matter
and not through empty space.

### A Ticking Clock {#6.html#x-ck12-QSBUaWNraW5nIENsb2Nr_31-xk9}

The fact that sound cannot travel through empty space was first
demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle
placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard
ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air
out of the jar. The clock was still ticking, but the ticking sound could
no longer be heard. That’s because the sound couldn’t travel away from
the clock without air particles to pass the sound energy along. You can
see an online demonstration of the same experiment—with a modern
twist—at this URL:

### Sound Waves and Matter {#6.html#x-ck12-U291bmQgV2F2ZXMgYW5kIE1hdHRlcg.._31-zom}

Most of the sounds we hear reach our ears through the air, but sounds
can also travel through liquids and solids. If you swim underwater—or
even submerge your ears in bathwater—any sounds you hear have traveled
to your ears through the water. Some solids, including glass and metals,
are very good at transmitting sounds. Foam rubber and heavy fabrics, on
the other hand, tend to muffle sounds. They absorb rather than pass on
the sound energy.

**Q:** How can you tell that sounds travel through solids?

**A:** One way is that you can hear loud outdoor sounds such as sirens
through closed windows and doors. You can also hear sounds through the
inside walls of a house. For example, if you put your ear against a
wall, you may be able to eavesdrop on a conversation in the next
room—not that you would, of course.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._31-drz}

-   In science, sound is defined as the transfer of energy from a
    vibrating object in waves that travel through matter.
-   All sound waves begin with vibrating matter. The vibrations generate
    longitudinal waves that travel through matter in all directions.
-   Most sounds we hear travel through air, but sounds can also travel

Has this ever happened to you? You see a flash of lightning on the
horizon, but several seconds pass before you hear the rumble of thunder.
The reason? The speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.

### What Is the Speed of Sound? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyB0aGUgU3BlZWQgb2YgU291bmQ__32-o43}

The **speed of sound** is the distance that sound waves travel in a
given amount of time. You’ll often see the speed of sound given as 343
meters per second. But that’s just the speed of sound under a certain
set of conditions, specifically, through dry air at 20 °C. The speed of
sound may be very different through other matter or at other
temperatures.

### Speed of Sound in Different Media {#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWQgb2YgU291bmQgaW4gRGlmZmVyZW50IE1lZGlh_32-trk}

Sound waves are mechanical waves, and mechanical waves can only travel
through matter. The matter through which the waves travel is called the
medium (plural, media). The **Table**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWRTb3VuZE1lZGl1bXM.) gives the speed of
sound in several different media. Generally, sound waves travel most
quickly through solids, followed by liquids, and then by gases.
Particles of matter are closest together in solids and farthest apart in
gases. When particles are closer together, they can more quickly pass
the energy of vibrations to nearby particles. You can explore the speed
of sound in different media at this URL:

[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/resources/s/sound/speedofsound.asp?strReferringChannel=resources&strReferringPageID=tcm:4-248291-64](speedofsound.asp?strReferringChannel=resources&strReferringPageID=tcm:4-248291-64)

  **Medium (20 °C)**   **Speed of Sound Waves (m/s)**
  -------------------- --------------------------------
  Dry Air              343
  Water                1437
  Wood                 3850
  Glass                4540
  Aluminum             6320

**Q:** The table gives the speed of sound in dry air. Do you think that
sound travels more or less quickly through air that contains water
vapor? (Hint: Compare the speed of sound in water and air in the table.)

**A:** Sound travels at a higher speed through water than air, so it
travels more quickly through air that contains water vapor than it does
through dry air.

### Temperature and Speed of Sound {#6.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgYW5kIFNwZWVkIG9mIFNvdW5k_32-adv}

The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium. For a
given medium, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures. You can
compare the speed of sound in dry air at different temperatures in the
following **Table** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-c291bmRfdGVtcGVyYXR1cmU.) .
At a lower temperature, particles of the medium are moving more slowly,
so it takes them longer to transfer the energy of the sound waves.

  **Temperature of Air**   **Speed of Sound Waves (m/s)**
  ------------------------ --------------------------------
  0 °C                     331
  20 °C                    343
  100 °C                   386

**Q:** What do you think the speed of sound might be in dry air at a
temperature of -20 °C?

**A:** For each 1 degree Celsius that temperature decreases, the speed
of sound decreases by 0.6 m/s. So sound travels through dry, -20 °C air
at a speed of 319 m/s.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._32-b23}

-   The speed of sound is the distance that sound waves travel in a
    given amount of time. The speed of sound in dry air at 20 °C is 343
    meters per second.
-   Generally, sound waves travel most quickly through solids, followed

A friend whispers to you in a voice so soft that she has to lean very
close so you can hear what she’s saying. Later that day, your friend
shouts to you from across the gymnasium. Now her voice is loud enough
for you to hear her clearly even though she’s several meters away.
Obviously, sounds can vary in loudness.

### It’s All About Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-SXTigJlzIEFsbCBBYm91dCBFbmVyZ3k._33-cxo}

**Loudness** refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The
loudness of sound is determined, in turn, by the intensity of the sound
waves. **Intensity** is a measure of the amount of energy in sound
waves. The unit of intensity is the **decibel (dB)** .

### Decibel Levels {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVjaWJlbCBMZXZlbHM._33-0as}

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcnQ.) shows decibel
levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound
waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel
increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater.
Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a
20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder
than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the
ears and cause loss of hearing.

**Q:** How much louder than a 20-decibel whisper is the 60-decibel sound
of a vacuum cleaner?

**A:** The vacuum cleaner is 10,000 times louder than the whisper!

### Amplitude and Distance {#6.html#x-ck12-QW1wbGl0dWRlIGFuZCBEaXN0YW5jZQ.._33-7mx}

The intensity of sound waves determines the loudness of sounds, but what
determines intensity? Intensity results from two factors: the amplitude
of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the
sound.

-   Amplitude is a measure of the size of sound waves. It depends on the
    amount of energy that started the waves. Greater amplitude waves
    have more energy and greater intensity, so they sound louder. For a
    video demonstration of the amplitude and loudness of sounds, go to
    this URL:
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqfGYD2UKw](watch?v=irqfGYD2UKw)
-   As sound waves travel farther from their source, the more spread out
    their energy becomes. You can see how this works in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU291bmQ.) . As distance from the
    sound source increases, the area covered by the sound
    waves increases. The same amount of energy is spread over a greater
    area, so the intensity and loudness of the sound is less. This
    explains why even loud sounds fade away as you move farther from
    the source.

This diagram represents just a small section of the total area of sound
waves spreading out from a source. Sound waves actually travel away from
the source in all directions.

</div>

**Q:** Why can low-amplitude sounds like whispers be heard only over
short distances?

**A:** The sound waves already have so little energy that spreading them
out over a wider area quickly reduces their intensity below the level of
hearing.

A marching band passes you as it parades down the street. You heard it
coming from several blocks away. Now that the different instruments have
finally reached you, their distinctive sounds can be heard. The tiny
piccolos trill their bird-like high notes, and the big tubas rumble out
their booming bass notes. Clearly, some sounds are higher or lower than
others.

### High or Low {#6.html#x-ck12-SGlnaCBvciBMb3c._34-ixt}

How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its **pitch** . Pitch, in
turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves. **Wave frequency** is the
number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time.
High-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the piccolo in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmFuZENvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) , have
high-frequency waves. Low-pitched sounds, like the sounds of the tuba

### Can You Hear It? {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2FuIFlvdSBIZWFyIEl0Pw.._34-tgu}

The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of
waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally
hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds
with frequencies below 20 hertz are called **infrasound** . Infrasound
is too low-pitched for humans to hear. Sounds with frequencies above
20,000 hertz are called **ultrasound** . Ultrasound is too high-pitched
for humans to hear.

Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example,
dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have
seen special whistles that dogs—but not people—can hear. The whistles
produce sounds with frequencies too high for the human ear to detect.
Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, like the one
pictured in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmF0) , can
hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz!

</div>

**Q:** Bats use ultrasound to navigate in the dark. Can you explain how?

**A:** Bats send out ultrasound waves, which reflect back from objects
ahead of them. They sense the reflected sound waves and use the
information to detect objects they can’t see in the dark. This is how
they avoid flying into walls and trees and also how they find flying
insects to eat.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._34-t4z}

-   How high or low a sound seems to a listener is its pitch. Pitch, in
    turn, depends on the frequency of sound waves.
-   High-frequency sound waves produce high-pitched sounds, and

Has this ever happened to you? You hear a siren from a few blocks away.
The source is a police car that is racing in your direction. As the car
approaches, zooms past you, and then speeds off into the distance, the
sound of its siren keeps changing in pitch. First the siren gets higher
in pitch, and then it suddenly gets lower. Do you know why this happens?
The answer is the Doppler effect.

### What Is the Doppler Effect? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyB0aGUgRG9wcGxlciBFZmZlY3Q__35-v6m}

The **Doppler effect** is a change in the frequency of sound waves that
occurs when the source of the sound waves is moving relative to a
stationary listener. (It can also occur when the sound source is
stationary and the listener is moving.) The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV80XzVfRG9wcGxlcl9FZmZlY3Q.) shows how
the Doppler effect occurs. The sound waves from the police car siren
travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (to
the left), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread
out behind it. Sound waves that are closer together have a higher
frequency, and sound waves that are farther apart have a lower
frequency. The frequency of sound waves, in turn, determines the pitch
of the sound. Sound waves with a higher frequency produce sound with a
higher pitch, and sound waves with a lower frequency produce sound with
a lower pitch. For an interactive animation of a diagram like the one

### Experiencing the Doppler Effect {#6.html#x-ck12-RXhwZXJpZW5jaW5nIHRoZSBEb3BwbGVyIEVmZmVjdA.._35-a2y}

As the car approaches listener A, the sound waves get closer together,
increasing their frequency. This listener hears the pitch of the siren
get higher. As the car speeds away from listener B, the sound waves get
farther apart, decreasing their frequency. This listener hears the pitch
of the siren get lower. You can experience the Doppler effect with a
moving siren in the following animation:
[http://www.epicphysics.com/physics-animations/doppler-effect-animation/]()

**Q:** What will the siren sound like to listener A after the police car
passes him?

**A:** The siren will suddenly get lower in pitch because the sound
waves will be much more spread out and have a lower frequency.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._35-an1}

-   The Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of sound waves that
    occurs when the source of the sound waves is moving relative to a
    stationary listener.
-   As the source of sound waves approaches a listener, the sound waves
    get closer together, increasing their frequency and the pitch of
    the sound. The opposite happens when the source of sound waves moves
    away from the listener.

This boy is cupping his hands behind his ears in order to hear better.
Do you think this will help? To answer this question, you need to know
more about sound, the ear, and how we hear.

### The Sounds We Hear {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNvdW5kcyBXZSBIZWFy_36-rpg}

**Sound** is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The
ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound is called **hearing** .
The organ that we use to sense sound energy is the ear. Almost all the
structures in the ear are needed for this purpose. Together, they gather
sound waves, amplify the waves, and change their kinetic energy to
electrical signals. The electrical signals travel to the brain, which
interprets them as the sounds we hear.

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlhZ3JhbUVhcg..) shows
the three main parts of the ear: the outer, middle, and inner ear. It
also shows the specific structures in each part of the ear. The roles of
these structures in hearing are described below and in this animation:

**Figure 6.75**

</div>

### Outer Ear {#6.html#x-ck12-T3V0ZXIgRWFy_36-wd2}

The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum.

-   The pinna is the only part of the ear that extends outward from
    the head. Its position and shape make it good at catching sound
    waves and funneling them into the ear canal.
-   The ear canal is a tube that carries sound waves into the ear. The
    sound waves travel through the air inside the ear canal to
    the eardrum.
-   The eardrum is like the head of a drum. It is a thin membrane
    stretched tight across the end of the ear canal. The eardrum
    vibrates when sound waves strike it, and it sends the vibrations on
    to the middle ear.

**Q:** How might cupping his hands behind his ears help the boy pictured
in the opening image hear better?

**A:** His hands might help the pinna of his ears catch sound waves and
direct them into the ear canal.

### Middle Ear {#6.html#x-ck12-TWlkZGxlIEVhcg.._36-jbl}

The middle ear contains three tiny bones (ossicles) called the hammer,
anvil, and stirrup. If you look at these bones in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlhZ3JhbUVhcg..) , you might notice that
they resemble the objects for which they are named. The three bones
transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. The arrangement
of the three bones allows them to work together as a lever that
increases the amplitude of the waves as they pass to the inner ear.

**Q:** Wave amplitude is the maximum distance particles of matter move
when a wave passes through them. Why would amplifying the sound waves as
they pass through the middle ear improve hearing?

**A:** Amplified sound waves have more energy. This increases the
intensity and loudness of the sounds, so they are easier to hear.

### Inner Ear {#6.html#x-ck12-SW5uZXIgRWFy_36-wnr}

The stirrup in the middle ear passes the amplified sound waves to the
inner ear through the oval window. When the oval window vibrates, it
causes the cochlea to vibrate as well. The cochlea is a shell-like
structure that is full of fluid and lined with nerve cells called hair
cells. Each hair cell has many tiny “hairs,” as you can see in the
magnified image [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGFpckNlbGw.) . When the
cochlea vibrates, it causes waves in the fluid inside. The waves bend
the “hairs” on the hair cells, and this triggers electrical impulses.
The electrical impulses travel to the brain through nerves. Only after
the nerve impulses reach the brain do we hear the sound.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._36-at6}

-   Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves through matter. The
    ear gathers and amplifies sound waves and changes them to
    electrical signals. The brain receives the signals and interprets
    them as the sounds we hear.
-   The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum. These
    structures gather sound waves, funnel them into the ear, and pass
    the vibrations to the middle ear.
-   The middle ear contains three tiny bones that amplify the vibrations
    as they transmit them to the inner ear.
-   In the inner ear, the vibrations are changed to electrical signals
    by hair cells lining the cochlea. The electrical signals then travel
    to the brain.

The noise of a cheering crowd at a game can be deafening! Really.

### The Ear and Hearing {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVhciBhbmQgSGVhcmluZw.._37-bma}

The ear is a complex organ that senses sound energy so we can hear.
**Hearing** is the ability to sense sound energy and perceive sound. All
of the structures of the ear that are involved in hearing must work well
for a person to have normal hearing. Damage to any of the structures,
through illness or injury, may cause hearing loss. Total hearing loss is
called deafness. To learn more about hearing loss, watch the animation
at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpIptQSEEjY](watch?v=YpIptQSEEjY) .

### Loud Sounds {#6.html#x-ck12-TG91ZCBTb3VuZHM._37-n0l}

The most common cause of hearing loss is exposure to loud sounds. Loud
sounds can damage hair cells inside the ears. Hair cells change sound
waves to electrical signals that the brain can interpret as sounds.
Louder sounds, which have greater intensity than softer sounds, can
damage hair cells more quickly than softer sounds. You can see the
relationship between sound intensity, exposure time, and hearing loss in
the following **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTG91ZG5lc3M.) .
The intensity of sounds is measured in decibels (dB).

**Figure 6.77**

</div>

**Q:** What is the maximum amount of time you should be exposed to a
sound as intense as 100 dB? What might make a sound this intense?

**A:** You should be exposed to a 100-dB sound for no longer than 15
minutes. An example of a sound this intense is the sound of a car horn.

### Shhhh! {#6.html#x-ck12-U2hoaGgh_37-ke2}

Hearing loss caused by loud sounds is permanent. However, this type of
hearing loss can be prevented by protecting the ears from loud sounds.
People who work in jobs that expose them to loud sounds must wear
hearing protectors. Examples include construction workers who work
around loud machinery for many hours each day. But anyone exposed to
loud sounds for longer than the permissible exposure time should wear
hearing protectors. Many home and yard chores and even recreational
activities are loud enough to cause hearing loss if people are exposed
to them for too much time. You can see examples in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV80XzdfTG91ZF9BY3Rpdml0ZXMtYWx0) .

### How Hearing Protectors Work {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IEhlYXJpbmcgUHJvdGVjdG9ycyBXb3Jr_37-g5z}

You can see two different types of hearing protectors in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSGVhcmluZ1Byb3RlY3RvcnM.) . Earplugs are
simple hearing protectors that just muffle sounds by partially blocking
all sound waves from entering the ears. This type of hearing protector
is suitable for lower noise levels, such as the noise of a lawnmower or
snowmobile.

Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude
sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction.
This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their
amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds
to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices
of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified
instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing
protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where
it’s important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds.

Do you ever see a colorful drum like this one before? It’s a traditional
musical instrument of Uruguay. The drummer is equally colorful. Each
time he strikes the drum, it produces a loud, pounding sound. There are
hundreds of different kinds of musical instruments, from drums to horns
to stringed instruments. Would it surprise you to learn that all of them
make sound in the same basic way?

### Making Music {#6.html#x-ck12-TWFraW5nIE11c2lj_38-j9x}

People have been using sound to make music for thousands of years. They
have invented many different kinds of musical instruments. Despite their
diversity, however, musical instruments share certain similarities.

-   All musical instruments create sound by causing matter to vibrate.
    The vibrations start sound waves moving through the air.
-   Most musical instruments use resonance to amplify the sound waves
    and make the sounds louder. **Resonance** occurs when an object
    vibrates in response to sound waves of a certain frequency. In a
    musical instrument such as a drum, the whole instrument and the air
    inside it may vibrate when the head of the drum is struck.
-   Most musical instruments have a way of changing the frequency of the
    sound waves they produce. This changes the **pitch** of the sounds,
    or how high or low the sounds seem to a listener.

### Categories of Musical Instruments {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2F0ZWdvcmllcyBvZiBNdXNpY2FsIEluc3RydW1lbnRz_38-jrq}

There are three basic categories of musical instruments: percussion,
wind, and stringed instruments. You can read in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSW5zdHJ1bWVudENvbXBvc2l0ZXM.) how

What could this smiling dolphin and yawning bat possibly have in common?
It’s not just that both of them are mammals. Both of them also use
ultrasound to find things in the dark.

### What Is Ultrasound? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBVbHRyYXNvdW5kPw.._39-hp8}

**Ultrasound** is sound that has a wave frequency higher than the human
ear can detect. It includes all sound with wave frequencies higher than
20,000 waves per second, or 20,000 hertz (Hz). Although we can’t hear
ultrasound, it is very useful to humans and some other animals. Uses of
ultrasound include echolocation, sonar, and ultrasonography.

### Echolocation {#6.html#x-ck12-RWNob2xvY2F0aW9u_39-nit}

Animals such as bats and dolphins send out ultrasound waves and use
their echoes, or reflected waves, to identify the locations of objects
they cannot see. This is called echolocation. Animals use echolocation
to find prey and avoid running into objects in the dark. You can see in
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmF0QnV0dGVyZmx5) and also
at the following URL how a bat uses echolocation to find insect prey.

### Sonar {#6.html#x-ck12-U29uYXI._39-cbp}

Sonar uses ultrasound in a way that is similar to echolocation.
**Sonar** stands for <span class="x-ck12-underline"> so </span> und
<span class="x-ck12-underline"> na </span> vigation and <span
class="x-ck12-underline"> r </span> anging. It is used to locate
underwater objects such as submarines. That’s how the ship pictured in
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV80XzhfU29uYXI.) is using
it. A sonar device is both a sender and a receiver. It sends out
ultrasound waves and detects the waves after they reflect from

The distance to underwater objects can be calculated from the known
speed of sound in water and the time it takes for the sound waves to
travel to the object. The equation for distance traveled when speed and
time are known is:

<dl id="x-ck12-YzE2YWQ0MmI3NTBmM2FlMDMyYWE3NjBhYjNhZmYwMGM.-epb">

Consider the ship and submarine pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV80XzhfU29uYXI.) . If an ultrasound wave
travels from the ship to the submarine and back again in 2 seconds, what
is the distance from the ship to the submarine? The sound wave travels
from the ship to the submarine in just 1 second, or half the time it
takes to make the round trip. The speed of sound waves through ocean
water is 1437 m/s. Therefore, the distance from the ship to the
submarine is:

<dl id="x-ck12-YmE0ZTA2ZDI5ZDkyNWMzMTcxNGE0YWY3NzI4MTM0MjY.-gzb">

</dd>
</dl>

**Q:** Now assume that the sonar device on the ship sends an ultrasound
wave to the bottom of the water. If the sound wave is reflected back to
the device in 4 seconds, how deep is the water?

**A:** The time it takes the wave to reach the bottom is 2 seconds. So
the distance from the ship to the bottom of the water is:

### Ultrasonography {#6.html#x-ck12-VWx0cmFzb25vZ3JhcGh5_39-r6y}

Another use of ultrasound is to “see” inside the human body. This use of
ultrasound is called ultrasonography. Harmless ultrasound waves are sent
inside the body, and the reflected waves are used to create an image on
a screen. This technology is used to examine internal organs and unborn
babies without risk to the patient. You can see a doctor using
ultrasound in the **Figure**

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._39-yuh}

-   Ultrasound is sound that has a wave frequency higher than the human
    ear can detect. It includes all sounds with wave frequencies higher
    than 20,000 waves per second, or 20,000 hertz (Hz).
-   Animals such as bats and dolphins send out ultrasound waves and use
    their echoes to identify the locations of objects they cannot see.
    This is called echolocation.
-   Sonar stands for sound navigation and ranging. It is used to locate
    underwater objects such as submarines.
-   Ultrasonography is the use of reflected ultrasound waves to “see”
    inside the body.

Did you ever wonder how a microwave works? It directs invisible waves of
radiation toward the food placed inside of it. The radiation transfers
energy to the food, causing it to get warmer. The radiation is in the
form of microwaves, which are a type of electromagnetic waves.

### What Are Electromagnetic Waves? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFdhdmVzPw.._40-oyw}

**Electromagnetic waves** are waves that consist of vibrating electric
and magnetic fields. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves transfer
energy from one place to another. The transfer of energy by
electromagnetic waves is called **electromagnetic radiation** .
Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy through matter or across empty
space. For an excellent video introduction to electromagnetic waves, go

**Q:** How do microwaves transfer energy inside a microwave oven?

**A:** They transfer energy through the air inside the oven to the food.

### May the Force Be with You {#6.html#x-ck12-TWF5IHRoZSBGb3JjZSBCZSB3aXRoIFlvdQ.._40-bsm}

A familiar example may help you understand the vibrating electric and
magnetic fields that make up electromagnetic waves. Consider a bar
magnet, like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWFuZXRpY0ZpZWxk) . The magnet exerts
magnetic force over an area all around it. This area is called a
magnetic field. The field lines in the diagram represent the direction
and location of the magnetic force. Because of the field surrounding a
magnet, it can exert force on objects without touching them. They just
have to be within its magnetic field.

**Q:** How could you demonstrate that a magnet can exert force on
objects without touching them?

**A:** You could put small objects containing iron, such as paper clips,
near a magnet and show that they move toward the magnet.

An electric field is similar to a magnetic field. It is an area of
electrical force surrounding a positively or negatively charged
particle. You can see electric fields in the following **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxlY3RyaWNGaWVsZA..) . Like a magnetic
field, an electric field can exert force on objects over a distance
without actually touching them.

### How an Electromagnetic Wave Begins {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGFuIEVsZWN0cm9tYWduZXRpYyBXYXZlIEJlZ2lucw.._40-srd}

An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged particle
vibrates. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmlicmF0aW5nQ2hhcmdl) shows how this
happens. A vibrating charged particle causes the electric field
surrounding it to vibrate as well. A vibrating electric field, in turn,
creates a vibrating magnetic field. The two types of vibrating fields
combine to create an electromagnetic wave. You can see animations of
electromagnetic waves at these URLs:

</div>

### How an Electromagnetic Wave Travels {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGFuIEVsZWN0cm9tYWduZXRpYyBXYXZlIFRyYXZlbHM._40-gtb}

As you can see in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmlicmF0aW5nQ2hhcmdl) , the electric and
magnetic fields that make up an electromagnetic wave are perpendicular
(at right angles) to each other. Both fields are also perpendicular to
the direction that the wave travels. Therefore, an electromagnetic wave
is a transverse wave. However, unlike a mechanical transverse wave,
which can only travel through matter, an electromagnetic transverse wave
can travel through empty space. When waves travel through matter, they
lose some energy to the matter as they pass through it. But when waves
travel through space, no energy is lost. Therefore, electromagnetic
waves don’t get weaker as they travel. However, the energy is “diluted”
as it travels farther from its source because it spreads out over an
ever-larger area.

### Electromagnetic Wave Interactions {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFdhdmUgSW50ZXJhY3Rpb25z_40-gzy}

When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may interact with it in
the same ways that mechanical waves interact with matter.
Electromagnetic waves may:

-   reflect, or bounce back from a surface;
-   refract, or bend when entering a new medium;
-   diffract, or spread out around obstacles.

Electromagnetic waves may also be absorbed by matter and converted to
other forms of energy. Microwaves are a familiar example. When
microwaves strike food in a microwave oven, they are absorbed and
converted to thermal energy, which heats the food.

### Sources of Electromagnetic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBFbGVjdHJvbWFnbmV0aWMgV2F2ZXM._40-bo5}

The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is the sun.
Electromagnetic waves travel from the sun to Earth across space and
provide virtually all the energy that supports life on our planet. Many
other sources of electromagnetic waves depend on technology. Radio
waves, microwaves, and X rays are examples. We use these electromagnetic
waves for communications, cooking, medicine, and many other purposes.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._40-chp}

-   Electromagnetic waves are waves that consist of vibrating electric
    and magnetic fields. They transfer energy through matter or
    across space. The transfer of energy by electromagnetic waves is
    called electromagnetic radiation.
-   The electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave are
    areas of electric or magnetic force. The fields can exert force over
    objects at a distance.
-   An electromagnetic wave begins when an electrically charged
    particle vibrates. This causes a vibrating electric field, which in
    turn creates a vibrating magnetic field. The two vibrating fields
    together form an electromagnetic wave.
-   An electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave that can travel across
    space as well as through matter. When it travels through space, it
    doesn’t lose energy to a medium as a mechanical wave does.
-   When electromagnetic waves strike matter, they may be reflected,
    refracted, or diffracted. Or they may be absorbed by matter and
    converted to other forms of energy.
-   The most important source of electromagnetic waves on Earth is
    the sun. Many other sources of electromagnetic waves depend

What a beautiful sunset! You probably know that sunlight travels in
waves through space from the sun to Earth. But do you know what light
really is? Is it just energy, or is it something else? In this article
you’ll find out that light may be more than it seems.  

### The Question {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFF1ZXN0aW9u_41-bnz}

Electromagnetic radiation, commonly called light, is the transfer of
energy by waves called electromagnetic waves. These waves consist of
vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Where does electromagnetic
energy come from? It is released when electrons return to lower energy
levels in atoms. Electromagnetic radiation behaves like continuous waves
of energy most of the time. Sometimes, however, electromagnetic
radiation seems to behave like discrete, or separate, particles rather
than waves. So does electromagnetic radiation consist of waves or
particles?

### The Debate {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIERlYmF0ZQ.._41-mgu}

This question about the nature of electromagnetic radiation was debated
by scientists for more than two centuries, starting in the 1600s. Some
scientists argued that electromagnetic radiation consists of particles
that shoot around like tiny bullets. Other scientists argued that
electromagnetic radiation consists of waves, like sound waves or water
waves. Until the early 1900s, most scientists thought that
electromagnetic radiation is either one or the other and that scientists
on the other side of the argument were simply wrong.

**Q:** Do you think electromagnetic radiation is a wave or a particle?

**A:** Here’s a hint: it may not be a question of either-or. Keep
reading to learn more.

### A New Theory {#6.html#x-ck12-QSBOZXcgVGhlb3J5_41-rne}

In 1905, the physicist Albert Einstein developed a new theory about
electromagnetic radiation. The theory is often called the
**wave-particle theory** . It explains how electromagnetic radiation can
behave as both a wave and a particle. Einstein argued that when an
electron returns to a lower energy level and gives off electromagnetic
energy, the energy is released as a discrete “packet” of energy. We now
call such a packet of energy a **photon** . According to Einstein, a
photon resembles a particle but moves like a wave. You can see this in
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGhvdG9u) . The theory
posits that waves of photons traveling through space or matter make up
electromagnetic radiation.

**Figure 6.87**

</div>

### Energy of a Photon {#6.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IG9mIGEgUGhvdG9u_41-lsv}

A photon isn’t a fixed amount of energy. Instead, the amount of energy
in a photon depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. The
frequency of a wave is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a
given amount of time, such as the number of waves per second. In waves
with higher frequencies, photons have more energy.

### Evidence for the Wave-Particle Theory {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZpZGVuY2UgZm9yIHRoZSBXYXZlLVBhcnRpY2xlIFRoZW9yeQ.._41-sgf}

After Einstein proposed his theory, evidence was discovered to support
it. For example, scientists shone laser light through two slits in a
barrier made of a material that blocked light. You can see the setup of
this type of experiment in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV81XzJfRG91YmxlX1NsaXQ.) . Using a
special camera that was very sensitive to light, they took photos of the
light that passed through the slits. The photos revealed tiny pinpoints
of light passing through the double slits. This seemed to show that
light consists of particles. However, if the camera was exposed to the
light for a long time, the pinpoints accumulated in bands that resembled
interfering waves. Therefore, the experiment showed that light seems to
consist of particles that act like waves.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._41-64k}

-   Electromagnetic radiation behaves like waves of energy most of the
    time, but sometimes it behaves like particles. From the 1600s until
    the early 1900s, most scientists thought that electromagnetic
    radiation consists either of particles or of waves but not both.
-   In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the wave-particle theory of
    electromagnetic radiation. This theory states that electromagnetic
    energy is released in discrete packets of energy—now called
    photons—that act like waves.
-   After Einstein presented his theory, scientists found evidence to
    support it. For example, double-slit experiments showed that light
    consists of tiny particles that create patterns of interference just
    as waves do.

What do these two photos have in common? They both represent
electromagnetic waves. These are waves that consist of vibrating
electric and magnetic fields. They transmit energy through matter or
across space. Some electromagnetic waves are generally harmless. The
light we use to see is a good example. Other electromagnetic waves can
be very harmful and care must be taken to avoid too much exposure to
them. X rays are a familiar example. Why do electromagnetic waves vary
in these ways? It depends on their properties. Like other waves,
electromagnetic waves have properties of speed, wavelength, and
frequency.

### Speed of Electromagnetic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWQgb2YgRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFdhdmVz_42-syu}

All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through empty space.
That speed, called the **speed of light** , is about 300 million meters
per second (3.0 x 10 ^8^ m/s). Nothing else in the universe is known to
travel this fast. The sun is about 150 million kilometers (93 million
miles) from Earth, but it takes electromagnetic radiation only 8 minutes
to reach Earth from the sun. If you could move that fast, you would be
able to travel around Earth 7.5 times in just 1 second! You can learn
more about the speed of light at this URL:

space, they may differ in their wavelengths, frequencies, and energy
levels.

-   Wavelength is the distance between corresponding points of adjacent
    waves (see the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2F2ZWxlbmd0aEZyZXF1ZW5jeQ..) ).
    Wavelengths of electromagnetic waves range from longer than a soccer
    field to shorter than the diameter of an atom.
-   Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a
    given amount of time. Frequencies of electromagnetic waves range
    from thousands of waves per second to trillions of waves per second.
-   The energy of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency.
    Low-frequency waves have little energy and are normally harmless.
    High-frequency waves have a lot of energy and are potentially
    very harmful.

**Q:** Which electromagnetic waves do you think have higher frequencies:
visible light or X rays?

**A:** X rays are harmful but visible light is harmless, so you can
infer that X rays have higher frequencies than visible light.

### Speed, Wavelength, and Frequency {#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWQsIFdhdmVsZW5ndGgsIGFuZCBGcmVxdWVuY3k._42-vmj}

The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency.
Because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through
space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency,
and vice versa. This relationship is represented by the equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-MmQyYWM5YTA5ZTk0OWE1NjFhMTRhMTg3OTQxMDI3MDE.-kdy">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MmQyYWM5YTA5ZTk0OWE1NjFhMTRhMTg3OTQxMDI3MDE.-ecp">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MmQyYWM5YTA5ZTk0OWE1NjFhMTRhMTg3OTQxMDI3MDE.-ma5">
<dd>
Speed = Wavelength × Frequency

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
The equation for wave speed can be rewritten as:

<dl id="x-ck12-ZTgxYzRlNGYyYjdiOTNiNDgxZTEzYTg1NTNjMmFlMWI.-nba">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ZTgxYzRlNGYyYjdiOTNiNDgxZTEzYTg1NTNjMmFlMWI.-73d">

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Therefore, if either wavelength or frequency is known, the missing value
can be calculated. Consider an electromagnetic wave that has a
wavelength of 3 meters. Its speed, like the speed of all electromagnetic
waves, is 3.0 × 10 ^8^ meters per second. Its frequency can be found by
substituting these values into the frequency equation:

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._42-iog}

-   All electromagnetic waves travel across space at the speed of light,
    which is about 300 million meters per second (3.0 x 10 ^8^ m/s).
-   Electromagnetic waves vary in wavelength and frequency. Longer
    wavelength electromagnetic waves have lower frequencies, and shorter
    wavelength waves have higher frequencies. Higher frequency waves
    have more energy.
-   The speed of a wave is a product of its wavelength and frequency.
    Because the speed of electromagnetic waves through space is
    constant, the wavelength or frequency of an electromagnetic wave can
    be calculated if the other value is known.

It’s a warm sunny Saturday, and Michael and Lavar have a big day
planned. They’re going to ride across town to meet their friends and
then go to the zoo. The boys may not realize it, but they will be
bombarded by electromagnetic radiation as they ride their bikes and walk
around the zoo grounds. The only kinds of radiation they can detect are
visible light, which allows them to see, and infrared light, which they
feel as warmth on their skin.

**Q:** Besides visible light and infrared light, what other kinds of
electromagnetic radiation will the boys be exposed to in sunlight?

**A:** Sunlight consists of all the different kinds of electromagnetic
radiation, from harmless radio waves to deadly gamma rays. Fortunately,
Earth’s atmosphere prevents most of the harmful radiation from reaching
Earth’s surface. You can read about the different kinds of
electromagnetic radiation in this article.

### Electromagnetic Radiation {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFJhZGlhdGlvbg.._43-fo3}

Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space
as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on
Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are
characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is
the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave
frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given
amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have
higher frequencies and more energy.

### A Spectrum of Electromagnetic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-QSBTcGVjdHJ1bSBvZiBFbGVjdHJvbWFnbmV0aWMgV2F2ZXM._43-taj}

Visible light and infrared light are just a small part of the full range
of electromagnetic radiation, which is called the **electromagnetic
spectrum** . You can see the waves of the electromagnetic spectrum in
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2F2ZVNwZWN0cnVt) . At the
top of the diagram, the wavelengths of the waves are given. Also
included are objects that are about the same size as the corresponding
wavelengths. The frequencies and energy levels of the waves are shown at
the bottom of the diagram. Some sources of the waves are also given. For

William can’t help rocking out when his favorite song starts playing on
the radio. Do you like to listen to the radio? Did you ever wonder how
music travels from a radio station to a radio receiver? How do the
sounds travel through air and buildings and everything else in between
you and the station? The answer is by electromagnetic waves.  

### A Spectrum of Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-QSBTcGVjdHJ1bSBvZiBXYXZlcw.._44-0aq}

Electromagnetic waves consist of vibrating electric and magnetic fields.
They transfer energy across space as well as through matter.
Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies, and
higher-frequency waves have more energy. The full range of wavelengths
of electromagnetic waves is called the electromagnetic spectrum. It is
outlined in the following **Figure**

### Introducing Radio Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgUmFkaW8gV2F2ZXM._44-vlh}

Electromagnetic waves on the left side of the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljc3BlY3RydW0.) are
called radio waves. **Radio waves** are electromagnetic waves with the
longest wavelengths. They may have wavelengths longer than a soccer
field. They are also the electromagnetic waves with the lowest
frequencies. With their low frequencies, they have the least energy of
all electromagnetic waves. Nonetheless, radio waves are very useful.
They are used for radio and television broadcasts and many other
purposes. You can learn more about radio waves, including how they were
discovered, at this URL:

**Q:** Based on the electromagnetic spectrum **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljc3BlY3RydW0.) , what
is the range of frequencies of radio waves?

**A:** The range of frequencies of radio waves is between 105 and 1012
Hz, or waves per second.

### AM and FM Radio {#6.html#x-ck12-QU0gYW5kIEZNIFJhZGlv_44-48o}

In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves, and then the
waves are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower. A radio
receiver detects the waves and changes them back to sounds. You may have
listened to both AM and FM radio stations. How sounds are encoded in
radio waves differs between AM and FM broadcasts.

-   AM stands for <span class="x-ck12-underline"> a </span> mplitude
    <span class="x-ck12-underline"> m </span> odulation. In AM
    broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude, or
    maximum height, of radio waves. AM broadcasts use longer wavelength
    radio waves than FM broadcasts. Because of their longer wavelengths,
    AM waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called
    the ionosphere. You can see how this happens in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQU1GTVdhdmVz) . Because the waves are
    reflected, they can reach radio receivers that are very far away
    from the radio tower.
-   FM stands for <span class="x-ck12-underline"> f </span> requency
    <span class="x-ck12-underline"> m </span> odulation. In FM
    broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of
    radio waves. Frequency modulation allows FM waves to encode more
    information than does amplitude modulation, so FM broadcasts usually
    produce clearer sounds than AM broadcasts. However, the relatively
    short wavelengths of FM waves means that they don’t reflect off the
    ionosphere as AM waves do. Instead, FM waves pass through the
    ionosphere and out into space. This is also shown in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQU1GTVdhdmVz) . As a result, FM waves
    cannot reach very distant receivers.

waves](ck12_6_files/20150911012820558809.png "Diagram illustrating the difference between AM and FM waves")

**Figure 6.92**

</div>

**Q:** The composition of the ionosphere changes somewhat from day to
night. The changes make the nighttime ionosphere even better at
reflecting AM radio waves. How do you think this might affect the
distance AM radio waves travel at night?

**A:** With greater reflection off the ionosphere, AM waves can travel
even farther at night than they can during the day. Radio receivers can
often pick up radio broadcasts at night from cities that are hundreds of
miles away.

### Television {#6.html#x-ck12-VGVsZXZpc2lvbg.._44-cyz}

Television broadcasts also use radio waves (see **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQU1GTVdhdmVz) ). For TV broadcasts,
sounds are encoded with frequency modulation, and pictures are encoded
with amplitude modulation. The encoded waves are broadcast from a TV
tower. When the waves are received by television sets, they are decoded
and changed back to sounds and pictures.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._44-jkb}

-   Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths, frequencies, and
    energy levels. The full range of electromagnetic waves makes up the
    electromagnetic spectrum.
-   Radio waves are electromagnetic waves with the longest wavelengths,
    lowest frequencies, and least amount of energy. They are used for
    radio and television broadcasts and many other purposes.
-   In radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves by changing
    either the amplitude (AM) or frequency (FM) of the waves. The
    encoded waves are broadcast from a tower and changed back to sounds
    by radio receivers.
-   In television broadcasts, sounds and pictures are encoded in radio
    waves, broadcast from a tower, and changed back to sounds and
    pictures by television sets.

This person is pointing a gun at a kid practicing his baseball pitch.
But it’s not the type of gun that can be used as a weapon. It’s a radar
gun, and it’s used to detect the speed of moving objects. It has
measured this pitch to be going at 51 miles per hour. Do you know how a
radar gun works? Instead of shooting bullets, it “shoots”
electromagnetic waves.

### Defining Electromagnetic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFdhdmVz_45-zsf}

Electromagnetic waves carry energy through matter or space as vibrating
electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves have a wide range of
wavelengths and frequencies. The complete range is called the
electromagnetic spectrum. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1NaWNyb3dhdmVz) shows all
the waves of the spectrum. The waves used in radar guns are microwaves.

### Defining Microwaves {#6.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pbmcgTWljcm93YXZlcw.._45-dha}

Find the microwave in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1NaWNyb3dhdmVz) . A
**microwave** is an electromagnetic wave with a relatively long
wavelength and low frequency. Microwaves are often classified as radio
waves, but they have higher frequencies than other radio waves. With
higher frequencies, they also have more energy. That’s why microwaves
are useful for heating food in microwave ovens. Microwaves have other
important uses as well, including cell phone transmissions and radar.
These uses are described below. You can learn more about microwaves and
their uses in the video at this URL:

### Cell Phones {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBQaG9uZXM._45-qis}

Cell phone signals are carried through the air as microwaves. You can
see how this works in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2VsbHBob25l) . A cell phone encodes the
sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves by changing the frequency of
the waves. This is called frequency modulation. The encoded microwaves
are then sent from the phone through the air to a cell tower. From the
cell tower, the waves travel to a switching center. From there they go
to another cell tower and from the tower to the receiver of the person
being called. The receiver changes the encoded microwaves back to
sounds.

**Figure 6.94**

</div>

**Q:** Cell towers reach high above the ground. Why do you think such
tall towers are used?

**A:** Microwaves can be interrupted by buildings and other
obstructions, so cell towers must be placed high above the ground to
prevent the interruption of cell phone signals.

### Radar {#6.html#x-ck12-UmFkYXI._45-a1a}

**Radar** stands for <span class="x-ck12-underline"> ra </span> dio
<span class="x-ck12-underline"> d </span> etection and <span
class="x-ck12-underline"> r </span> anging. In police radar, a radar gun
sends out short bursts of microwaves. The microwaves reflect back from
oncoming vehicles and are detected by a receiver in the radar gun. The
frequency of the reflected waves is used to compute the speed of the

and other purposes.

</div>

**Q:** How are reflected microwaves used to determine the speed of
oncoming cars (see **Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFkYXI.)
)?

**A:** As the car approaches the radar gun, the reflected microwaves get
bunched up in front of the car. Therefore, the waves the receiver
detects have a higher frequency than they would if they were being
reflected from a stationary object. The faster the car is moving, the
greater the increase in the frequency of the waves. This is an example
of the Doppler effect, which can also occur with sound waves.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._45-rye}

-   Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelength, frequency,
    and energy. The full range of electromagnetic waves makes up the
    electromagnetic spectrum.
-   Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with relatively long
    wavelengths and low frequencies. They are used for microwave ovens,
    cell phones, and radar.
-   A cell phone encodes the sounds of the caller’s voice in microwaves
    by changing the frequency of the waves. The encoded microwaves then
    travel through the air to a cell tower and eventually to the
    receiver of the person being called. The receiver decodes the
    microwaves and changes them back to sounds.
-   Radar stands for radio detection and ranging. It is the use of
    reflected microwaves to determine vehicle speeds, track storms, or
    detect air traffic.

Slip! Slop! Slap! Did you ever hear this slogan? It stands for *slip* on
a shirt, *slop* on some sunscreen, and *slap* on a hat. The slogan
originated in Australia in the 1980s, but it has since been adopted in
many other places around the globe. It sums up simple steps you can take
to protect your skin from sunlight. Sunlight consists of a wide range of
electromagnetic waves, some of which are harmful.

### The Waves in Sunlight {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFdhdmVzIGluIFN1bmxpZ2h0_46-1mu}

Electromagnetic waves are waves that carry energy through matter or
space as vibrating electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves
have a wide range of wavelengths and frequencies. Sunlight contains the
complete range of wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, which is called
the electromagnetic spectrum. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1MaWdodA..) shows all the
waves in the spectrum.

electromagnetic
spectrum](ck12_6_files/20150911012821299511.png "Infrared, ultraviolet, and visible light fall in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum")

**Figure 6.96**

</div>

### Let There Be Light {#6.html#x-ck12-TGV0IFRoZXJlIEJlIExpZ2h0_46-2pu}

Light includes infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. As
you can see from the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1MaWdodA..) , light falls
roughly in the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum. It has shorter
wavelengths and higher frequencies than microwaves, but not as short and
high as X rays.

**Q:** Which type of light do you think is harmful to the skin?

**A:** Waves of light with the highest frequencies have the most energy
and are harmful to the skin. Use the electromagnetic spectrum in the
**Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1MaWdodA..) to
find out which of the three types of light have the highest frequencies.

### Infrared Light {#6.html#x-ck12-SW5mcmFyZWQgTGlnaHQ._46-wpo}

Light with the longest wavelengths is called **infrared light** . The
term *infrared* means “below red.” Infrared light is the range of light
waves that have longer wavelengths and lower frequencies than red light
in the visible range of light waves. The sun gives off infrared light as
do flames and living things. You can’t see infrared light waves, but you
can feel them as heat. But infrared cameras and night vision goggles can
detect infrared light waves and convert them to visible images. For a
deeper understanding of infrared light, watch the video at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2--0q0XlQJ0](watch?v=2--0q0XlQJ0) .

### Visible Light {#6.html#x-ck12-VmlzaWJsZSBMaWdodA.._46-nph}

The only light that people can see is called **visible light** . This
light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths that falls between
infrared light and ultraviolet light. Within the visible range, we see
light of different wavelengths as different colors of light, from red
light, which has the longest wavelength, to violet light, which has the
shortest wavelength (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVmlzaWJsZUxpZ2h0) ). When all of the
wavelengths of visible light are combined, as they are in sunlight,
visible light appears white. You can learn more about visible light at
this URL:

### Ultraviolet Light {#6.html#x-ck12-VWx0cmF2aW9sZXQgTGlnaHQ._46-bsu}

Light with wavelengths shorter than visible light is called
**ultraviolet light** . The term ultraviolet means “above violet.”
*Ultraviolet* light is the range of light waves that have shorter
wavelengths and higher frequencies than violet light in the visible
range of light. With higher frequencies than visible light, ultraviolet
light has more energy. It can be used to kill bacteria in food and to
sterilize surgical instruments. The human skin also makes vitamin D when
it is exposed to ultraviolet light. Vitamin D, in turn, is needed for
strong bones and teeth. You can learn more about ultraviolet light and
its discovery at this URL:

Too much exposure to ultraviolet light can cause sunburn and skin
cancer. As the “slip, slop, slap” slogan suggests, you can protect your
skin from ultraviolet light by wearing clothing that covers your skin,
applying sunscreen to any exposed areas, and wearing a hat to protect
your head from exposure. The SPF, or sun-protection factor, of sunscreen
gives a rough idea of how long it protects the skin from sunburn (see
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3Vuc2NyZWVu) ). A sunscreen
with a higher SPF value protects the skin longer. Sunscreen must be
applied liberally and often to be effective, and no sunscreen is
completely waterproof. You can learn more about the dangers of
ultraviolet light at this URL:

**Q:** You should apply sunscreen even on cloudy days. Can you explain
why?

**A:** Ultraviolet light can travel through clouds, so it can harm
unprotected skin even on cloudy days.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._46-zef}

-   Sunlight contains the complete range of wavelengths of
    electromagnetic waves. The entire range is called the
    electromagnetic spectrum.
-   Electromagnetic waves that are commonly called light fall roughly in
    the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum. Light includes infrared
    light, visible light, and ultraviolet light.
-   Infrared light is light with the longest wavelengths and
    lowest frequencies. You can’t see infrared light, but you can feel
    it as heat. Besides the sun, flames and living things give off
    infrared light.
-   Visible light consists of a very narrow range of wavelengths that
    falls between infrared light and ultraviolet light. It is the only
    light that people can see. Different wavelengths of visible light
    appear as different colors.
-   Ultraviolet light has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies
    than visible light. Ultraviolet light also has more energy, which
    makes it useful for killing germs. Too much exposure to ultraviolet
    light can damage the skin.

You probably recognize this somewhat startling image as an X-ray image
of a human skull. X-rays, which are used to make images like this one,
are electromagnetic waves.  

### Putting X-Rays in Context {#6.html#x-ck12-UHV0dGluZyBYLVJheXMgaW4gQ29udGV4dA.._47-kfw}

Electromagnetic waves are vibrating electric and magnetic fields that
transfer energy across space as well as through matter. There are
several different types of electromagnetic waves that vary in their
frequencies and wavelengths. Waves with higher frequencies have more
energy. The electromagnetic spectrum pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1YcmF5cw..) represents the
full range of frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

</div>

### High Energy Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-SGlnaCBFbmVyZ3kgV2F2ZXM._47-lf8}

Electromagnetic waves with the highest frequencies and greatest energy
are on the right side of the electromagnetic spectrum in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bS1YcmF5cw..) . **X-rays**
have more energy than any other electromagnetic waves except gamma rays.
For example, X-rays have enough energy to pass through soft tissues such
as skin, although not enough to pass through bones and teeth, which are
very dense. The bright areas in the skull X-ray shows where X-rays were
absorbed by teeth and bones. X-rays are used not only for medical and
dental purposes but also to screen luggage at airports (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtWHJheQ..) ). You can learn about the
discovery of X-rays as well as other uses of X-rays at this URL:

</div>

**Q:** What do the dark areas in an X-ray image represent?

**A:** The dark areas represent materials that do not absorb X-rays.
Instead, the X-rays pass through these areas. For example, in the X-ray
image pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtWHJheQ..) , the bag doesn't show up
because X-rays pass through the soft cloth, but not the dense objects
inside.

### Dangers of X-Rays {#6.html#x-ck12-RGFuZ2VycyBvZiBYLVJheXM._47-idz}

Because X-rays are so energetic, they can penetrate many substances,
including living cells. Therefore, too much X-ray exposure can be
dangerous. It may damage cells and cause cancer. If you’ve had dental
X-rays, you may have noticed that a heavy apron was placed over your
body to protect it from stray X-rays. Protective aprons like this are
made of lead, which X-rays can’t pass through.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._47-ei5}

-   Electromagnetic waves vary in their frequencies and wavelengths, and
    waves with higher frequencies have greater energy. The
    electromagnetic spectrum represents the full range of frequencies of
    electromagnetic waves.
-   X-rays are high-frequency electromagnetic waves with more energy
    than any other electromagnetic waves except gamma rays.
-   X-rays are used to make images of bones and teeth inside the body
    and to see inside luggage at airports.
-   X-rays can penetrate the body, damage cells, and cause cancer.

It’s an incredibly energetic explosion that is thought to occur when a
massive star collapses. The burst lasts just seconds or minutes, but it
has more energy than a million billion suns! As you might have guessed,
gamma rays are released during a gamma ray burst. Gamma rays are
extremely energetic electromagnetic waves.

### What Are Gamma Rays? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgR2FtbWEgUmF5cz8._48-10z}

As you can see in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRU1TcGVjdHJ1bQ..) , **gamma rays** have
the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies of all electromagnetic
waves. Their wavelengths are shorter than the diameter of atomic nuclei,
and their frequencies are greater than 1019 hertz (Hz). That’s 10
quadrillion waves per second! Because of their high frequencies, gamma
rays are also the most energetic of all electromagnetic waves. If you
want to learn more about gamma rays, watch the video at the URL below.

### Sources of Gamma Rays {#6.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBHYW1tYSBSYXlz_48-wxs}

Gamma rays are given off by radioactive atoms and nuclear explosions.
They are also given off by the sun and other stars, as well as by
collapsing stars in gamma ray bursts. Fortunately, gamma rays from space
are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere before they can reach the surface.

**Q:** Predict how gamma rays might affect living things on Earth if
they weren’t absorbed by the atmosphere.

**A:** Gamma rays would destroy most living things on Earth because they
have so much energy.

### Dangers and Uses of Gamma Rays {#6.html#x-ck12-RGFuZ2VycyBhbmQgVXNlcyBvZiBHYW1tYSBSYXlz_48-qrj}

The extremely high energy of gamma rays allows them to penetrate just
about anything. They can even pass through bones and teeth. This makes
gamma rays very dangerous. They can destroy living cells, produce gene
mutations, and cause cancer. Ironically, the deadly effects of gamma
rays can be used to treat cancer. In this type of treatment, a medical
device sends out focused gamma rays that target cancerous cells. The
gamma rays kill the cells and destroy the cancer.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._48-t3k}

-   Electromagnetic waves vary in their wavelengths and frequencies.
    Higher-frequency waves have more energy.
-   Of all electromagnetic waves, gamma rays have the shortest
    wavelengths and highest frequencies. Because of their very high
    frequencies, gamma rays have more energy than any other
    electromagnetic waves.
-   Sources of gamma rays include radioactive atoms, nuclear explosions,
    and stars. Gamma rays from space are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere.
-   Gamma rays can destroy living cells, produce mutations, and
    cause cancer. They can be used to treat cancer by focusing the
    deadly rays on cancer cells.

Imagine scuba diving and coming upon a jellyfish. Would you be startled
if the jellyfish suddenly started to glow with bright yellow light, like
the jellyfish in the picture above? If so, then the jellyfish would have
done its job. Jellyfish give off light to startle possible predators.
The light they emit is visible light.

### The Light We See {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExpZ2h0IFdlIFNlZQ.._49-jbi}

**Visible light** includes all the wavelengths of light that the human
eye can detect. It allows us to see objects in the world around us.
Without visible light, we would only be able to sense most objects by
sound, touch, or smell. Like humans, most other organisms also depend on
visible light, either directly or indirectly. Many animals—including
predators of jellyfish—use visible light to see. Plants and certain
other organisms use visible light to make food in the process of
photosynthesis. Without this food, most other organisms would not be
able to survive.

**Q:** Do you think that some animals might be able to see light that
isn’t visible to humans?

**A:** Some animals can see light in the infrared or ultraviolet range
of wavelengths. For example, mosquitoes can see infrared light, which is
emitted by warm objects. By seeing infrared light, mosquitoes can tell
where the warmest, blood-rich areas of the body are located.

### Incandescence {#6.html#x-ck12-SW5jYW5kZXNjZW5jZQ.._49-sho}

Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun. The sun and other
stars produce light because they are so hot. They glow with light due to
their extremely high temperatures. This way of producing light is called
**incandescence** . Incandescent light bulbs also produce light in this
way. When electric current passes through a wire filament inside an
incandescent bulb, the wire gets so hot that it glows. Do you see the
glowing filament inside the incandescent light bulb in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGlnaHRidWxi) ?

**Figure 6.102**

</div>

**Q:** What are some other sources of incandescent light?

**A:** Flames also produce incandescent light. For example, burning
candles, oil lamps, and bonfires produce light in this way.

### Luminescence {#6.html#x-ck12-THVtaW5lc2NlbmNl_49-cvw}

Some objects produce light without becoming very hot. They generate
light through chemical reactions or other processes. Producing light
without heat is called **luminescence** . Luminescence, in turn, can
occur in several different ways:

-   One type of luminescence is called fluorescence. In this process, a
    substance absorbs shorter-wavelength ultraviolet light and then
    gives off light in the visible range of wavelengths. Certain
    minerals produce light in this way, including gemstones such as
    amethyst, diamond, and emerald. At the following URL, move your
    mouse over the minerals in the picture to see the magic of
    fluorescence: [http://www.fluomin.org/uk/]() .
-   Another type of luminescence is called electroluminescence. In this
    process, a substance gives off light when an electric current passes
    through it. Gases such as neon, argon, and krypton produce light by
    this means. The car dash lights in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2hhcmdlcg..) are produced
    by electroluminescence.

**Figure 6.103**

</div>

-   A third type of luminescence is called bioluminescence. This is the
    production of light by living things as a result of
    chemical reactions. The jellyfish in the opening photo above
    produces light by bioluminescence. So does the firefly in the
    **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmlyZWZsaWVz) . Fireflies
    give off visible light to attract mates. You can learn more about
    bioluminescence in the video at this URL:

### Illumination {#6.html#x-ck12-SWxsdW1pbmF0aW9u_49-zkn}

Many other objects appear to produce their own light, but they actually
just reflect light from another source. Being lit by another source is
called **illumination** . The moon in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW9vbg..) is glowing so brightly that you
can see shadows under the trees. It appears to glow from its own light,
but it’s really just illuminated by light from the sun. Everything you
can see that doesn’t produce its own light is illuminated by light from
some other source.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._49-blu}

-   Visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human
    eye can detect. Humans and virtually all other organisms depend on
    visible light to survive. Humans and many other animals use it
    to see. Plants use it to make food for themselves and most
    other organisms.
-   Most of the visible light on Earth comes from the sun. The sun
    produces light because it is so hot. Glowing with visible light
    because of a high temperature is called incandescence.
-   Producing light without a high temperature is called luminescence.
    Types of luminescence include fluorescence, electroluminescence,
    and bioluminescence.
-   All objects you can see that do not produce their own light are
    reflecting light from another source. This is known as illumination.

# Artificial Light {#6.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aWZpY2lhbCBMaWdodA..}

<div class="x-ck12-data-objectives">

-   Identify five different types of artificial lights.
-   Explain how each type of artificial light produces visible light.

What an exciting scene! The picture above shows Times Square in New York
City. There are so many artificial lights that it’s almost as bright as
day even after the sun has gone down. Sunlight provides most of the
visible light on Earth, but artificial lights are also important. That’s
obvious to someone in Times Square at night. It’s also obvious to anyone
who’s ever experienced a power outage after dark.

### Turn on the Lights {#6.html#x-ck12-VHVybiBvbiB0aGUgTGlnaHRz_50-4tb}

If you’re like most people, you don’t give it a thought when you flick a
switch to turn on a light—at least not until the power goes out and
you’re left in the dark! When you flick on a light switch, electricity
normally flows through the light, and some type of light bulb converts
the electrical energy to visible light. This can happen in various ways,
depending on the type of light bulb. Several different types of light
bulbs are described below. All of them are examples of **artificial
light** , as opposed to natural light from the sun or other sources in
nature.

### Incandescent Light {#6.html#x-ck12-SW5jYW5kZXNjZW50IExpZ2h0_50-qqh}

An incandescent light bulb like the one pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGlnaHRidWxiQmx1ZQ..) produces visible
light by incandescence. Incandescence occurs when something gets so hot
that it glows. An incandescent light bulb contains a thin wire filament
made of tungsten. When electric current passes through the filament, it
gets extremely hot and emits light.

### Fluorescent Light {#6.html#x-ck12-Rmx1b3Jlc2NlbnQgTGlnaHQ._50-eq9}

A fluorescent light bulb produces visible light by fluorescence.
Fluorescence occurs when a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength
ultraviolet light and then gives off the energy as visible light. The
compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ0ZM) contains mercury gas that gives off
ultraviolet light when electricity passes through it. The inside of the
bulb is coated with a substance called phosphor. Phosphor absorbs the
ultraviolet light and then gives off most of the energy as visible
light.

### Neon Light {#6.html#x-ck12-TmVvbiBMaWdodA.._50-s4f}

A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. In this
process, neon or some other gas gives off light when an electric current
passes through it. Other halogen gases besides neon—including krypton
and argon—also produce light in this way. The word “OPEN” in the sign
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT3BlblNpZ24.) is a neon light. It is a
long glass tube that contains neon gas. When electricity passes through
the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, and the electrons jump to a
higher energy level. As the excited electrons return to their original
energy level, they give off visible light. Neon produces red light.
Other gases produce light of different colors. For example, krypton
produces violet light, and argon produces blue light.

### Vapor Light {#6.html#x-ck12-VmFwb3IgTGlnaHQ._50-bu6}

A vapor light also produces visible light by electroluminescence The
bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a
mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through
the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and
emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like the streetlight pictured
in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTmlnaHRMaWdodA..) ,
produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. In
addition to lighting city streets, vapor lights are used to light
highways and stadiums. The bulbs are very bright and long lasting so
they are a good choice for these places.

### LED Light {#6.html#x-ck12-TEVEIExpZ2h0_50-1fn}

LED stands for “light-emitting diode.” An LED light contains a material
called a semi-conductor, which gives off visible light when an electric
current flows through it. LED lights are used for traffic lights (see
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RvcGxpZ2h0) ) and also
indicator lights on computers, cars, and many other devices. This type
of light is very reliable and durable.

**Q:** Some light bulbs produce a lot of heat in addition to visible
light, so they waste energy. Other bulbs produce much less heat, so they
use energy more efficiently. Which light bulbs described above would you
place in each category?

**A:** Incandescent light bulbs, which produce light by incandescence,
give off a lot of heat as well as light, so they waste energy. The other
light bulbs produce light by some type of luminescence, in which light
is produced without heat. These light bulbs use energy more efficiently.
Which types of light bulbs do you use?

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._50-hdv}

-   Most artificial lights use electricity for energy and have a light
    bulb that changes the electrical energy to visible light. The
    production of visible light can happen in various ways, depending on
    the type of bulb.
-   Types of light bulbs include incandescent, fluorescent, neon, vapor,
    and LED bulbs. They produce light in different ways and have
    different uses. Incandescent lights use heat to produce visible
    light, so they are not as energy efficient as the other types
    of lights.

A mime is an actor who uses movement and facial expressions rather than
words to communicate with an audience. The mime in this picture is using
a mirror to apply stage makeup that will accentuate her features so she
can communicate more expressively. When light strikes a mirror, it is
reflected back from the shiny surface. The reflected light forms an
image of whatever is in front of the mirror. Reflection is just one way
that visible light may interact with matter.

### Reflection {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVmbGVjdGlvbg.._51-ybs}

Reflection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface that
it cannot pass through. Reflection may be regular or diffuse.

-   If the surface is very smooth, like a mirror, the reflected light
    forms a very clear image. This is called regular, or
    specular, reflection. In the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJlZUNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) , the smooth
    surface of the still water in the pond on the left reflects light in
    this way.
-   When light is reflected from a rough surface, the waves of light are
    reflected in many different directions, so a clear image does
    not form. This is called diffuse reflection. In the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJlZUNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) , the ripples
    in the water in the picture on the right cause diffuse reflection of
    the blooming trees.

### Transmission {#6.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNtaXNzaW9u_51-zmf}

**Transmission** of light occurs when light passes through matter. As
light is transmitted, it may pass straight through matter or it may be
refracted or scattered as it passes through.

-   When light is refracted, it changes direction as it passes into a
    new medium and changes speed. The straw in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmVudFBlbmNpbA..) looks bent where
    light travels from water to air. Light travels more quickly in air
    than in water and changes direction. For a detailed explanation of
    how this happens, watch the animation at this URL:

-   **Scattering** occurs when light bumps into tiny particles of matter
    and spreads out in all directions. In the **Figure**

    headlights are shining through fog. The light is scattered by water
    droplets in the air, giving the headlights a “halo” appearance.

</div>

**Q:** What might be another example of light scattering?

**A:** When light passes through smoky air, it is scattered by tiny
particles of soot.

### Absorption {#6.html#x-ck12-QWJzb3JwdGlvbg.._51-vpb}

Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or
transmitted by matter. This is called **absorption** . When light is
absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you
get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and
other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch,
especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark
colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.

**Q:** In hot sunny climates, people often dress in light-colored
clothes. Why is this a good idea?

**A:** Light-colored clothes absorb less light and reflect more light
than dark-colored clothes, so they keep people cooler.

### Classifying Matter in Terms of Light {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZnlpbmcgTWF0dGVyIGluIFRlcm1zIG9mIExpZ2h0_51-6dz}

Matter can be classified on the basis of its interactions with light.
Matter may be transparent, translucent, or opaque. An example of each
type of matter is pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnJvc3RlZGdsYXNz) .

-   **Transparent** matter is matter that transmits light without
    scattering it. Examples of transparent matter include air, pure
    water, and clear glass. You can see clearly through transparent
    objects, such as the top panes of the window
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnJvc3RlZGdsYXNz) , because just
    about all of the light that strikes them passes through to the
    other side.

-   **Opaque** matter is matter that does not let any light pass
    through it. Matter may be opaque because it absorbs light, reflects
    light, or does some combination of both.

Examples of opaque objects are objects made of wood, like the shutters
in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2luZG93Q29tcG9zaXRl) .
The shutters absorb most of the light that strikes them and reflect just
a few wavelengths of visible light. The glass mirror
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2luZG93Q29tcG9zaXRl) is also opaque.
That’s because it reflects all of the light that strikes it.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._51-uti}

-   Reflection of light occurs when light bounces back from a surface
    that it cannot pass through. If the surface is very smooth, the
    reflected light forms an image.
-   Transmission of light occurs when light passes through matter. As
    light is transmitted, it may pass straight through matter or it may
    be refracted or scattered by matter.
-   Absorption of light occurs when light transfers its energy to matter
    rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. The
    temperature of matter increases with the added energy.
-   Matter can be classified as transparent, translucent, or opaque
    depending on how it interacts with light.

This rainbow contains all the colors that you can see in the land below
it—the yellow of the hills, the green of the leaves and grasses. It
contains other colors as well. In fact, a rainbow contains all of the
colors of visible light.

### Wavelength and Color {#6.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZWxlbmd0aCBhbmQgQ29sb3I._52-lie}

Visible light is light that has wavelengths that can be detected by the
human eye. The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the
light appears. As you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmFpbmJvd1dhdmVz) , light with the
longest wavelength appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength
appears violet. In between are all the other colors of light that we can
see. Only seven main colors of light are actually represented in the
diagram.

### Separating Colors of Light {#6.html#x-ck12-U2VwYXJhdGluZyBDb2xvcnMgb2YgTGlnaHQ._52-nzj}

A prism, like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHJpc21MaWdodA..) , can be used to
separate visible light into its different colors. A prism is a
pyramid-shaped object made of transparent matter, usually clear glass or
plastic. Matter that is transparent allows light to pass through it. A
prism transmits light but slows it down. When light passes from air to
the glass of the prism, the change in speed causes the light to change
direction and bend. Different wavelengths of light bend at different
angles. This makes the beam of light separate into light of different
wavelengths. What we see is a rainbow of colors. For an animated version
of the prism below, go to this URL:

**Q:** Look back at the rainbow that opened this article. Do you see all
the different colors of light, from red at the top to violet at the
bottom? What causes a rainbow to form? **A:** Individual raindrops act
as tiny prisms. They separate sunlight into its different wavelengths
and create a rainbow of colors.

### Colors of Objects {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29sb3JzIG9mIE9iamVjdHM._52-zbj}

An opaque object is one that doesn’t let light pass through it. Instead,
it reflects or absorbs the light that strikes it. Many objects, such as
the leaves pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGVhZg..) , reflect just one or a few
wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest. The wavelengths that
are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human
eye. For example, the leaves appear green because they reflect green
light and absorb light of other wavelengths.

**Figure 6.118**

</div>

A transparent or translucent material, such as window glass, transmits
some or all of the light that strikes it. This means that the light
passes through the material rather than being reflected by it. In this
case, we see the material because of the transmitted light. Therefore,
the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the
object appears. Look at the beautiful stained glass windows in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RhaW5lZEdsYXNz) . The
different colors of glass transmit light of different colors.

**Figure 6.119**

</div>

The color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that
the object appears. For example, if only blue light strikes green
leaves, the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected.

**Q:** What color do you see if an object absorbs all of the light that
strikes it?

**A:** When all of the light is absorbed, none is reflected, so the
object looks black. But black isn’t a color of light. Black is the
absence of light.

### The Colors We See {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENvbG9ycyBXZSBTZWU._52-mbf}

The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These
three colors are called the **primary colors** of light. All other
colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors. Look at
the Venn diagram [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUHJpbWFyeUNvbG9ycw..) .
Red and green light combine to form yellow light. Red and blue light
combine to form magenta light, and blue and green light combine to form
cyan light. Yellow, magenta, and cyan are called the secondary colors of
light. Look at the center of the diagram, where all three primary colors
of light combine. The result is white light. You can explore the colors
of visible light and how they combine at this URL:

### Pigments {#6.html#x-ck12-UGlnbWVudHM._52-v5k}

Many objects have color because they contain pigments. A **pigment** is
a substance that colors materials by reflecting light of certain
wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. A very common
pigment is the dark green pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in
plants. Chlorophyll absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light.
Pigments are also found in many manufactured products. They are used to
color paints, inks, and dyes. Just three pigments, called primary
pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors. The primary
colors of pigments are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan,
magenta, and yellow.

**Q:** A color printer needs just three colors of ink to print all of
the colors that we can see. Which colors are they?

**A:** The three colors of ink in a color printer are the three primary
pigment colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow. These three colors can be
combined in different ratios to produce all other colors, so they are
the only colors needed for full-color printing.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._52-bv7}

-   The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the
    light appears. Light with the longest wavelength appears red, and
    light with the shortest wavelength appears violet. In between are
    the wavelengths of all the other colors of light.
-   A prism separates visible light into its different colors. As light
    passes through the prism, it slows and bends, but different
    wavelengths bend at different angles. This separates light into
    different wavelengths, forming a rainbow of colors.
-   The wavelengths of visible light that an object reflects or
    transmits determine the color that the object appears to the
    human eye.
-   The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These
    three colors are the primary colors of light. All other colors of
    light can be created by combining the primary colors. Secondary
    colors of light—cyan, yellow, and magenta—form when two primary
    colors combine equally.
-   Pigments are substances that color materials by reflecting light of
    certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. The
    primary pigment colors are cyan, yellow, and magenta. They can be

These dancers are practicing in front of a mirror so they can see how
they look as they performs. They’re watching their image in the mirror
as they dance. What is an image, and how does it get “inside” a mirror?
In this article, you’ll find out.  

### Reflected Light and Images {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVmbGVjdGVkIExpZ2h0IGFuZCBJbWFnZXM._53-moe}

**Reflection** is one of several ways that light can interact with
matter. Light reflects off surfaces such as mirrors that do not transmit
or absorb light. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may
form an image. An **image** is a copy of an object that is formed by
reflected (or refracted) light.

**Q:** Is an image an actual object? If not, what is it?

**A:** No, an image isn’t an actual object. It is focused rays of light
that make a copy of an object, like a picture projected on a screen.

### Regular and Diffuse Reflection {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVndWxhciBhbmQgRGlmZnVzZSBSZWZsZWN0aW9u_53-iaz}

If a surface is extremely smooth, as it is in a mirror, then the image
formed by reflection is sharp and clear. This is called regular
reflection (also called specular reflection). However, if the surface is
even slightly rough or bumpy, an image may not form, or if there is an
image, it is blurry or fuzzy. This is called diffuse reflection.

**Q:** Look at the boats and their images in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQm9hdENvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) . Which one
represents regular reflection, and which one represents diffuse
reflection?

**A:** Reflection of the boat on the left is regular reflection. The
water is smooth and the image is sharp and clear. Reflection of the boat
on the right is diffuse reflection. The water has ripples and the image
is blurry and wavy.

In the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVmbGVjdGlvblJheXM.) ,
you can see how both types of reflection occur. Waves of light are
represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are
referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are
known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are
reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection
forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in
many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at
best, a blurry image. You can see animations of both types of reflection
at this URL:

### Law of Reflection {#6.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIFJlZmxlY3Rpb24._53-wj0}

One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reflection. The angle at
which the reflected rays leave the surface is equal to the angle at
which the incident rays strike the surface. This is known as the **law
of reflection** . The law is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVmbGVjdGlvbg..) and also in this
animation:

According to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection always
equals the angle of incidence. The angles of both reflected and incident
light are measured relative to an imaginary line, called normal, that is
perpendicular (at right angles) to the reflective surface.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._53-xjp}

-   Reflection is one of several ways that light can interact
    with matter. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may
    form an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by
    reflected (or refracted) light.
-   Regular reflection occurs when light reflects off a very smooth
    surface and forms a clear image. Diffuse reflection occurs when
    light reflects off a rough surface and forms a blurry image or no
    image at all.
-   According to the law of reflection, the angle at which light rays
    reflect off a surface is equal to the angle at which the incident
    rays strike the surface.

What does this picture show? Is it a photo of identical twin sisters, or
is it just one girl looking in a mirror? The picture shows a single girl
and her mirror image.

### How Mirrors Form Images {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1pcnJvcnMgRm9ybSBJbWFnZXM._54-rxo}

A mirror is typically made of glass with a shiny metal backing that
reflects all the light that strikes it. When a mirror reflects light, it
forms an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by
reflection or refraction. Mirrors may have flat or curved surfaces. The
shape of a mirror’s surface determines the type of image it forms. For
example, some mirrors form real images, and other mirrors form virtual
images. What’s the difference between real and virtual images?

-   A real image forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays
    actually meet. It is a true image that could be projected on
    a screen.
-   A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror. Of
    course, reflected rays don’t actually go through the mirror to the
    other side, so a virtual image doesn’t really exist. It just appears
    to exist to the human brain.

**Q:** Look back at the image of the girl pointing at her image in the
mirror. Which type of image is it, real or virtual?

**A:** The image of the girl is a virtual image. It appears to be on the
other side of the mirror from the girl.

### Plane Mirror {#6.html#x-ck12-UGxhbmUgTWlycm9y_54-aa2}

The mirror in the opening photo is a plane mirror. This is the most
common type of mirror. It has a flat reflective surface and forms only
virtual images. The image formed by a plane mirror is also right-side up
and life sized. But something is different about the image compared with
the real object in front of the mirror. Left and right are reversed.
Look at the girl brushing her teeth in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGxhbmVNaXJyb3I.) . She is using her left
hand to brush her teeth, but her image (on the left) appears to be

### Concave Mirror {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uY2F2ZSBNaXJyb3I._54-rgf}

Some mirrors have a curved rather than flat surface. Curved mirrors can
be concave or convex. A **concave** mirror is shaped like the inside of
a bowl. This type of mirror forms either real or virtual images,
depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point. The
focal point is the point in front of the mirror where the reflected rays
meet. You can see how concave mirrors form images in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29uY2F2ZU1pcnJvcg..) and at the
following URL. Concave mirrors are used behind car headlights. They
focus the light and make it brighter. Concave mirrors are also used in
some telescopes.

### Convex Mirror {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29udmV4IE1pcnJvcg.._54-x83}

The other type of curved mirror, a **convex** mirror, is shaped like the
outside of a bowl. Because of its shape, it can gather and reflect light
from a wide area. As you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29udmV4TWlycm9y) , a convex mirror forms
only virtual images that are right-side up and smaller than the actual
object. You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in the animation

**Q:** Convex mirrors are used as side mirrors on cars. You can see one
in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FyTWlycm9y) . Why is
a convex mirror good for this purpose?

**A:** Because it gathers light over a wide area, a convex mirror gives
the driver a wider view of the area around the vehicle than a plane
mirror would.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._54-cja}

-   When a mirror reflects light, it forms an image. An image is a copy
    of an object formed by reflection (or refraction). A real image is a
    true image that forms in front of a mirror where reflected light
    rays actually meet. A virtual image appears to be on the other side
    of the mirror and doesn’t really exist.
-   Most mirrors are plane mirrors that have a flat reflective surface.
    A plane mirror forms only virtual, right-side up, and
    life-sized images.
-   A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl. The type of
    image it forms depends on where the object is relative to the
    focal point. The image may be real, upside down, and reduced in
    size; or it may be virtual, right-side up, and enlarged.
-   A convex mirror is shaped like the outside of a bowl. It forms only
    virtual images that are right-side up and reduced in size relative
    to the object.

Is this some kind of magic trick? Or is this straw really broken where
it enters the water? The answer to both questions is no. There’s nothing
wrong with the straw, and no magic is involved. It’s simply how light
may behave when it enters a new medium.

### Speed of Light and Matter {#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWQgb2YgTGlnaHQgYW5kIE1hdHRlcg.._55-nbt}

Light always travels at the same speed across space. That speed,
represented by the letter c, is about 300 million meters per second.
However, when light travels through a medium, it travels more slowly.
The speed varies for different kinds of matter. The **Table**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-U3BlZWRMaWdodGluTWF0) gives the speed of visible
light in six different materials.

  **Material**    **Speed of Visible Light (m/s)**
  --------------- ----------------------------------
  Air             299 million
  Water           231 million
  Glass           200 million
  Vegetable oil   150 million
  Alcohol         140 million
  Diamond         125 million

**Q:** Predict the speed of visible light through vinegar.

**A:** Vinegar is mostly water, so if you predicted that the speed of
light through vinegar would be close to its speed through water, you are
correct. The speed of visible light through Heinz® vinegar is about 230
million m/s.

### Bending Light {#6.html#x-ck12-QmVuZGluZyBMaWdodA.._55-ocz}

When light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed. For
example, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down. If light
strikes a sheet of glass at a 90° angle, or perpendicular to the glass,
it slows down but still passes straight through the glass. However, if
light enters the glass at an angle other than 90°, the light bends as it
slows down. The bending of light as it changes speed in a new medium is
called **refraction** . The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmVmcmFjdGlvbg..) shows how refraction
occurs. Notice that the speed of light changes again as it passes from
the glass back to the air. In this case, the speed increases, and the
ray of light resumes its initial direction. For a more detailed
explanation of refraction, watch this video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RM46yvDOHI](watch?v=8RM46yvDOHI) .

**Figure 6.132**

</div>

### What’s Your Angle? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgWW91ciBBbmdsZT8._55-r08}

The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends
on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the
angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes
from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water.
That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in
water.

**Q:** Now can you explain why the straw in the opening image appears to
be broken where it enters the water?

**A:** The straw appears to be broken because of refraction. Light slows
down and bends when it passes from the water in the glass to the air on
its way to your eyes.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._55-7a2}

-   Light always travels at the same speed through empty space. That
    speed, represented by the letter c, is about 300 million meters
    per second. However, when light travels through a medium, it travels
    more slowly.
-   If light passes from one medium to another at an angle other than 90
    °, the light changes speed and bends. This bending of light is
    called refraction.
-   The angle at which light refracts when it enters a different medium
    depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the
    greater the angle of refraction is.

The tiny object on this man’s finger is life-changing for him. It lets
him see clearly without wearing glasses. You probably recognize the
object as a contact lens. You may even wear contact lenses yourself.

### What Is a Lens? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhIExlbnM__56-aci}

A **lens** is a transparent object with one or two curved surfaces. It
is typically made of glass (or clear plastic in the case of a contact
lens). A lens refracts, or bends, light and forms an image. An image is
a copy of an objected formed by the refraction (or reflection) of
visible light. The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it
refracts the light that passes through it. There are two basic types of
lenses: concave and convex. The two types of lenses have different
shapes, so they bend light and form images in different ways.

### Concave Lens {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uY2F2ZSBMZW5z_56-a0n}

A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle. You can
see the shape of a concave lens in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29uY2F2ZUxlbnM.) . From the diagram,
it’s clear that the lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread
apart, as they pass through it. Note that the image formed by a concave
lens is on the same side of the lens as the object. It is also smaller
than the object and right-side up. However, it isn’t a real image. It is
a virtual image. Your brain “tricks” you into seeing an image there. The
light rays actually pass through the glass to the other side and spread
out in all directions. You can explore the formation of images by a
concave lens at this URL:

### Convex Lens {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29udmV4IExlbnM._56-3gz}

A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges. You can see
the shape of a convex lens in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29udmV4TGVucw..) . A convex lens causes
rays of light to converge, or meet, at a point called the focus (F). A
convex lens forms either a real or virtual image. It depends on how
close the object is to the lens relative to the focus. You can interact
with an animated convex lens at this URL:

**Q:** An example of a convex lens is a hand lens. Which of the three
convex lens diagrams in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29udmV4TGVucw..) shows how a hand lens
makes an image?

**A:** You’ve probably looked through a hand lens before. If you have,
then you know that the image it produces is right-side up. Therefore,
the first diagram must show how a hand lens makes an image. It’s the
only one that produces a right-side up image.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._56-uz6}

-   A lens is a transparent object, typically made of glass, with one or
    two curved surfaces. A lens refracts light and forms an image.
-   A concave lens is thicker at the edges than it is in the middle.
    This causes rays of light to diverge. The light forms a virtual
    image that is right-side up and smaller than the object.
-   A convex lens is thicker in the middle than at the edges. This
    causes rays of light to converge. The light forms a real or virtual

This colorful burst of “spaghetti” is really a bundle of optical fibers.
These are hair-thin threads of glass that transmit laser light that has
been encoded with messages. Optical fibers are a crucial component of
modern communications. The use of light in devices such as these is
possible because of optics.

### Optics and Optical Instruments {#6.html#x-ck12-T3B0aWNzIGFuZCBPcHRpY2FsIEluc3RydW1lbnRz_57-hl4}

**Optics** is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to
extend human vision and do other tasks. Knowledge of light was needed
for the invention of optical instruments such as microscopes,
telescopes, and cameras, in addition to optical fibers. These
instruments use mirrors and lenses to reflect and refract light and form
images.

**Q:** What is an image?

**A:** An image is a copy of an object created by the reflection or
refraction of visible light.

### Light Microscope {#6.html#x-ck12-TGlnaHQgTWljcm9zY29wZQ.._57-ckr}

A light microscope is an instrument that uses lenses to make enlarged
images of objects that are too small for the unaided eye to see. A
common type of light microscope is a compound microscope, like the one
shown in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWljcm9zY29wZQ..)
. A compound microscope has at least two convex lenses: one or more
objective lenses and one or more eyepiece lenses. The objective lenses
are close to the object being viewed. They form an enlarged image of the
object inside the microscope. The eyepiece lenses are close to the
viewer’s eyes. They form an enlarged image of the first image. The
magnifications of all the lenses are multiplied together to yield the
overall magnification of the microscope. Some light microscopes can
magnify objects more than 1000 times! For more on light microscopes and
the images they create, watch the video at this URL:

**Q:** How has the microscope advanced scientific knowledge?

**A:** The microscope has revealed secrets of the natural world like no
other single invention. The microscope let scientists see entire new
worlds, leading to many discoveries—especially in biology and
medicine—that could not have been made without it. Some examples include
the discovery of cells and the identification of bacteria and other
single-celled organisms. With the development of more powerful
microscopes, viruses were discovered and even atoms finally became
visible. These discoveries changed our ideas about the human body and
the nature of life itself.

### Telescope {#6.html#x-ck12-VGVsZXNjb3Bl_57-wv1}

Like microscopes, telescopes use convex lenses to make enlarged images.
However, telescopes make enlarged images of objects—such as distant
stars—that only appear tiny because they are very far away. There are
two basic types of telescopes: reflecting telescopes and refracting
telescopes. The two types are compared in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVGVsZXNjb3Blcw..) . They differ in how
they collect light, but both use convex lenses to form enlarged images.

### Camera {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2FtZXJh_57-1xa}

A camera is an optical instrument that forms and records an image of an
object. The image may be recorded on film or it may be detected by an
electronic sensor that stores the image digitally. Regardless of how the
image is recorded, all cameras form images in the same basic way, as
shown in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2FtZXJh) .

-   Light passes through the lens at the front of the camera and enters
    the camera through an opening called the aperture.
-   As light passes through the lens, it forms a reduced real image. The
    image focuses on film (or a sensor) at the back of the camera. The
    lens may be moved back and forth to bring the image into focus.
-   The shutter controls the amount of light that actually strikes the
    film (or sensor). It stays open longer in dim light to let more
    light in.

### Lasers {#6.html#x-ck12-TGFzZXJz_57-0wk}

Did you ever see a cat chase after a laser light, like the one in
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2F0TGFzZXI.) ? A **laser** is
a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one
wavelength and color. Waves of laser light are synchronized so the
crests and troughs of the waves line up. The diagram in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2F0TGFzZXI.) shows why a beam of laser
light is so focused compared with ordinary light from a flashlight.

The following **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGFzZXI.)
provides a closer look at the tube where laser light is created.
Electrons in a material such as a ruby crystal are stimulated to radiate
photons of light of one wavelength. At each end of the tube is a concave
mirror. The photons of light reflect back and forth in the tube off
these mirrors. This focuses the light. The mirror at one end of the tube
is partly transparent. A constant stream of photons passes through the
transparent part, forming the laser beam. You can see an animation
showing how a laser works at this URL:

### Optical Fibers {#6.html#x-ck12-T3B0aWNhbCBGaWJlcnM._57-fhk}

Besides entertaining a cat, laser light has many other uses. One use is
carrying communication signals in optical fibers. Sounds or pictures are
encoded in pulses of laser light, which are then sent through an optical
fiber. All of the light reflects off the inside of the fiber, so none of
it escapes. As a result, the signal remains strong even over long
distances. More than one signal can travel through an optical fiber at
the same time, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT3B0aWNhbEZpYmVy) . Optical fibers are
used to carry telephone, cable TV, and Internet signals.

**Q:** When lasers were invented in 1960, they were called "a solution
looking for a problem.” Since then, they have been put to thousands of
different uses. Can you name other ways that lasers are used?

**A:** The first widespread use of lasers was the supermarket barcode
scanner, introduced in 1974. The compact disc (CD) player was the first
laser-equipped device commonly used by consumers, starting in 1982. The
CD player was quickly followed by the laser printer. Some other uses of
lasers include bloodless surgery, cutting and welding of metals, guiding
missiles, thermometers, laser light shows, and acne treatments.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._57-89t}

-   Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to
    extend human vision and do other tasks. Optical instruments are
    based on optics. They use mirrors and lenses to reflect and refract
    light and form images.
-   The light microscope and telescope use convex lenses and mirrors to
    make enlarged images of very tiny or distant objects. A camera uses
    a convex lens to make a reduced image of an object.
-   A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of visible
    light of just one wavelength and color. Pulses of laser light carry
    communication signals through optical fibers.

Did you ever hear the proverb, “the eyes are the windows to the soul”?
While it’s true that our eyes often express what we are thinking or
feeling, they are windows in another sense as well. Like windows made of
glass, the eyes let light in and allow us to see.

### Structure and Function of the Eye {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiB0aGUgRXll_58-v0a}

The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and focus
images. The structures of the human eye are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRXllRGlhZ3JhbQ..) . Examine each
structure in the diagram as you read about it below.

eye](ck12_6_files/20150911012828659175.jpeg "Diagram of the eye")

**Figure 6.141**

</div>

-   The sclera, also known as the white of the eye, is an opaque outer
    covering that protects the eye. It keeps light out of the eye except
    at the center front of the eye.
-   The cornea is a transparent outer covering of the front of the eye.
    It protects the eye and also acts as a convex lens. A convex lens is
    thicker in the middle than at the edges and makes rays of light
    converge, or meet at a point. The shape of the cornea helps focus
    light that enters the eye.
-   The pupil is an opening in the front of the eye. It looks black
    because it doesn’t reflect any light. All the light passes through
    it instead. The pupil controls the amount of light that enters
    the eye. It automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less
    light in as needed.
-   The iris is the colored part of the eye. It controls the size of
    the pupil.
-   The lens of the eye is a convex lens. It fine-tunes the focus so an
    image forms on the retina at the back of the eye. Tiny muscles
    control the shape of the lens to focus images of close or
    distant objects.
-   The retina is a membrane lining the back of the eye. The retina has
    nerve cells called rods and cones that change images to
    electrical signals. Rods are good at sensing dim light but can’t
    distinguish different colors of light. Cones can sense colors but
    not dim light. There are three different types of cones. Each type
    senses one of the three primary colors of light (red, green,
    or blue).
-   The optic nerve carries electrical signals from the rods and cones
    to the brain.

**Q:** The lens of the eye is a convex lens. How would vision be
affected if the lens of the eye was concave instead of convex?

**A:** A concave lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart.
It forms a virtual image on the same side of the lens at the object
being viewed. Therefore, a concave lens would focus the image in front
of the eye, not on the retina inside the eye. No signals would be sent
to the brain so vision would not be possible.

### How We See {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IFdlIFNlZQ.._58-h9p}

The ability to see is called **vision** . This ability depends on more
than healthy eyes. It also depends on certain parts of the brain,
because the brain and eyes work together to allow us to see. The eyes
collect and focus visible light. The lens and other structures of the
eye work together to focus an image on the retina. The image is
upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV82XzEwX0V5ZV9CcmFpbg..) . Cells in the
retina change the image to electrical signals that travel to the brain
through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the electrical signals as
shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it
were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see
always appears right-side up. The brain also interprets what we are
seeing.

**Q:** The part of the brain that processes information from the eyes is
the visual cortex. It is located at the back of the brain. How might an
injury to the visual cortex affect vision?

**A:** An injury to the visual cortex might cause abnormal vision or
even blindness regardless of how well the eyes can gather and focus
light.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._58-wix}

-   The human eye is an organ that is specialized to collect light and

If you’ve ever had your vision checked, you’ve no doubt been asked to
read an eye chart like the one in this cartoon. The patient in the
cartoon must be having trouble making out the letters in the second row
of the chart, because he asks the doctor for a hint (in the style of a
popular TV game show). The patient clearly has a vision problem.  

### Problems with Vision {#6.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmxlbXMgd2l0aCBWaXNpb24._59-vjg}

Many people have problems with their **vision** , or ability to see.
Often, the problem is due to the shape of the eyes and how they focus
light. Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and
farsightedness, which you can read about below. You may even have one of
these vision problems yourself. Usually, the problems can be corrected
with contact lenses or lenses in eyeglasses. In many people, they can
also be corrected with laser surgery, which reshapes the outer layer of
the eye. For a video about vision problems, go to this URL:

### Nearsightedness {#6.html#x-ck12-TmVhcnNpZ2h0ZWRuZXNz_59-ujb}

Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are
seen clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTXlvcGlh) shows how it occurs. The
eyeball is longer (from front to back) than normal. This causes images
to be focused in front of the retina instead of on the retina. Myopia
can be corrected with concave lenses. The lenses focus images farther
back in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of in front of it.

</div>

**Q:** Sometimes squinting the eyes can help someone see more clearly.
Why do you think this works?

**A:** Squinting may improve focus by slightly changing the shape of the
eyes. When you squint, you tighten muscles around the eyes, putting
pressure on the eyeballs.

### Farsightedness {#6.html#x-ck12-RmFyc2lnaHRlZG5lc3M._59-hxz}

Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects
are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the
eyeball is shorter than normal (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSHlwZXJvcGlh) ). This causes images to be
focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass
through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The
lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the
retina instead of behind it.

**Q:** Joey has hyperopia. When is he more likely to need his glasses:
when he reads a book or when he watches TV?

**A:** With hyperopia, Joey is farsighted. He can probably see the TV
more clearly than the words in a book because the TV is farther away.
Therefore, he is more likely to need his glasses when he reads than when
he watches TV.

A lightning bolt is like the spark that gives you a shock when you touch
a metal doorknob. Of course, the lightning bolt is on a *much* larger
scale. But both the lightning bolt and spark are a sudden transfer of
electric charge.

### Introducing Electric Charge {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgRWxlY3RyaWMgQ2hhcmdl_60-fur}

**Electric charge** is a physical property of particles or objects that
causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All
electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton
has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric
charge. In the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQXRvbQ..) , you
can see that positively charged protons (+) are located in the nucleus
of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the
nucleus.

</div>

### Electric Force {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgRm9yY2U._60-0o1}

When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract, so positive and
negative particles attract each other. You can see this in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV83XzFfRWxlY3RyaWNfRm9yY2Vz)
. This attraction explains why negative electrons keep moving around the
positive nucleus of the atom. Like charges, on the other hand, repel
each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart. This is
also shown in the diagram. The attraction or repulsion between charged
particles is called **electric force** . The strength of electric force
depends on the amount of electric charge on the particles and the
distance between them. Larger charges or shorter distances result in
greater force. You can experiment with electric force with the animation
at the following URL.

Halt! This science fiction image shows a human hand surrounded by a
green force field. It’s supposed to represent an electric field

### What Is an Electric Field? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFbGVjdHJpYyBGaWVsZD8._61-ebb}

An **electric field** is a space around a charged particle where the
particle exerts electric force on other charged particles. Because of

### Interacting Electric Fields {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJhY3RpbmcgRWxlY3RyaWMgRmllbGRz_61-dt2}

When charged particles are close enough to exert force on each other,
their electric fields interact. This is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRmllbGRMaW5lcw..) . The lines of force
bend together when particles with different charges attract each other.
The lines bend apart when particles with like charges repel each other.

Why is this girl's hair standing straight up? She is touching a device
called a van de Graaff generator. The dome on top of the device has a
negative electric charge. When the girl places her hand on the dome, she
becomes negatively charged as well—right down to the tip of each hair!
You can see a video demonstrating a van de Graff generator at this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SREXQWAIDJk](watch?v=SREXQWAIDJk)

**Q:** What causes the hair to stand on end?

**A:** All of the hairs have all become negatively charged, and like
charges repel each other. Therefore, the hairs are pushing away from
each other, causing them to stand on end.

### Transferring Electrons {#6.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNmZXJyaW5nIEVsZWN0cm9ucw.._62-0xt}

The girl pictured above became negatively charged because electrons
flowed from the van de Graaff generator to her. Whenever electrons are
transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged. This occurs
even with individual atoms. Atoms are neutral in electric charge because
they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons.
However, if atoms lose or gain electrons, they become charged particles
called ions. You can see how this happens in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSW9ucw..) . When an atom loses electrons,
it becomes a positively charged ion, or cation. When an atom gains
electrons, it becomes a negative charged ion, or anion.

### Conservation of Charge {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmF0aW9uIG9mIENoYXJnZQ.._62-til}

Like the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general
depends on the transfer of electrons, either between two materials or
within a material. Three ways this can occur are referred to as
conduction, polarization, and friction. All three ways are described
below. However, regardless of how electrons are transferred, the total
charge always remains the same. Electrons move, but they aren’t
destroyed. This is the **law of conservation of charge** .

### Conduction {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29uZHVjdGlvbg.._62-shi}

The transfer of electrons from the van de Graaff generator to the man is
an example of conduction. Conduction occurs when there is direct contact
between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept
electrons. A van de Graff generator produces a negative charge on its
dome, so it tends to give up electrons. Human hands are positively
charged, so they tend to accept electrons. Therefore, electrons flow
from the dome to the man’s hand when they are in contact.

You don’t need a van de Graaff generator for conduction to take place.
It may occur when you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes.
Wool tends to give up electrons and rubber tends to accept them.
Therefore, the carpet transfers electrons to your shoes each time you
put down your foot. The transfer of electrons results in you becoming
negatively charged and the carpet becoming positively charged.

### Polarization {#6.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXJpemF0aW9u_62-erh}

Assume that you have walked across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes
and become negatively charged. If you then reach out to touch a metal
doorknob, electrons in the neutral metal will be repelled and move away
from your hand before you even touch the knob. In this way, one end of
the doorknob becomes positively charged and the other end becomes
negatively charged. This is called polarization. Polarization occurs
whenever electrons within a neutral object move because of the electric
field of a nearby charged object. It occurs without direct contact
between the two objects. The **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUG9sYXJpemF0aW9u) models how polarization
occurs.

</div>

**Q:** What happens when the negatively charged plastic rod in the
diagram is placed close to the neutral metal plate?

**A:** Electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in
the rod. The electrons move away from the rod, causing one side of the
plate to become positively charged and the other side to become
negatively charged.

### Friction {#6.html#x-ck12-RnJpY3Rpb24._62-cud}

Did you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair? You can see what
happens in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtNS03LTMtQmFsbG9vbi1zdGF0aWM.) . Friction
between the balloon and hair cause electrons from the hair to “rub off”
on the balloon. That’s because a balloon attracts electrons more
strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon
becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged. The
individual hairs push away from each other and stand on end because like
charges repel each other. The balloon and the hair attract each other
because opposite charges attract.

Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between
materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.

URL to see how electrons are transferred by friction between a sweater
and a balloon.

**Q:** If you rub a balloon against a wall, it may stick to the wall.
Explain why.

**A:** Electrons are transferred from the wall to the balloon, making
the balloon negatively charged and the wall positively charged. The
balloon sticks to the wall because opposite charges attract.

You’re a thoughtful visitor, so you wipe your feet on the welcome mat
before you reach out to touch the brass knocker on the door. Ouch! A
spark suddenly jumps between your hand and the metal, and you feel an
electric shock.

**Q:** Why do you think an electric shock occurs?

**A:** An electric shock occurs when there is a sudden discharge of
static electricity.

### What Is Static Electricity? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBTdGF0aWMgRWxlY3RyaWNpdHk__63-cr2}

**Static electricity** is a buildup of electric charges on objects.
Charges build up when negative electrons are transferred from one object
to another. The object that gives up electrons becomes positively
charged, and the object that accepts the electrons becomes negatively
charged. This can happen in several ways.

One way electric charges can build up is through friction between
materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.
When you wipe your rubber-soled shoes on the wool mat, for example,
electrons rub off the mat onto your shoes. As a result of this transfer
of electrons, positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges
build up on you.

Once an object becomes electrically charged, it is likely to remain
charged until it touches another object or at least comes very close to
another object. That’s because electric charges cannot travel easily
through air, especially if the air is dry.

**Q:** You’re more likely to get a shock in the winter when the air is
very dry. Can you explain why?

**A:** When the air is very dry, electric charges are more likely to
build up objects because they cannot travel easily through the dry air.
This makes a shock more likely when you touch another object.

### Static Discharge {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RhdGljIERpc2NoYXJnZQ.._63-obp}

What happens when you have become negatively charged and your hand
approaches the metal doorknocker? Your negatively charged hand repels
electrons in the metal, so the electrons move to the other side of the
knocker. This makes the side of the knocker closest to your hand
positively charged. As your negatively charged hand gets very close to
the positively charged side of the metal, the air between your hand and
the knocker also becomes electrically charged. This allows electrons to
suddenly flow from your hand to the knocker. The sudden flow of
electrons is **static discharge** . The discharge of electrons is the
spark you see and the shock you feel. Watch the animation “John
Travoltage” at the following URL to see an example of static electricity
and static discharge.

### How Lightning Occurs {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IExpZ2h0bmluZyBPY2N1cnM._63-tae}

Another example of static discharge, but on a much larger scale, is
lightning. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram (

During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of positive and negative
charge due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice
particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the
clouds, and the positive charges are concentrated at the top. The
negative charges repel electrons on the ground beneath them, so the
ground below the clouds becomes positively charged. At first, the
atmosphere prevents electrons from flowing away from areas of negative
charge and toward areas of positive charge. As more charges build up,
however, the air between the oppositely charged areas also becomes
charged. When this happens, static electricity is discharged as bolts of
lightning.

At the URL below, you can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike.
Be sure to wait for the real-time lightning strike at the end of the
video. You’ll be amazed when you realize how much has occurred during
that split-second discharge of static electricity.

Emily’s dad is giving his car battery a “jump” because the battery
“died” overnight. He’s attaching cables to the terminals of the car
battery. Then he will connect the other ends of the cables to the
terminals of a “live” battery. The cables will carry electric current to
the dead battery, providing the energy needed for the car to start.

### Flowing Charges {#6.html#x-ck12-Rmxvd2luZyBDaGFyZ2Vz_64-vxo}

**Electric current** is a continuous flow of electric charges
(electrons). Current is measured as the amount of charge that flows past
a given point in a certain amount of time. The SI unit for electric
current is the ampere (A), or amp. Electric current may flow in just one
direction (direct current), or it may keep reversing direction
(alternating current). You can watch an animation of electric current at
this URL:
[http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/Electric\_current/index.html](index.html)

**Q:** Why do you think charges flow in an electric current?

**A:** Electric charges flow when they have electric potential energy.
Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position
or shape.

### Electric Potential Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgUG90ZW50aWFsIEVuZXJneQ.._64-b9e}

Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle
in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close
together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and
have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart,
their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move
spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to
a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water
falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due
to gravity.

### Voltage {#6.html#x-ck12-Vm9sdGFnZQ.._64-ho2}

For an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must
be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions.
A difference in electric potential energy is called **voltage** . The SI
unit for voltage is the volt (V). Look at the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV83XzVfVm9sdGFnZQ..) . It shows a simple
circuit. The source of voltage in the circuit is a 1.5-volt battery. The
difference of 1.5 volts between the two battery terminals results in a
spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current, between them. Notice
that the current flows from the negative terminal to the positive
terminal, because electric current is a flow of electrons.

**Q:** You might put a 1.5-volt battery in a TV remote. The battery in a
car is a 12-volt battery. How do you think the current of a 12-volt
battery compares to the current of a 1.5-volt battery?

**A:** Greater voltage means a greater difference in potential energy,
so the 12-volt battery can produce more current than the 1.5-volt
battery.

-   Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges. The SI
    unit for electric current is the ampere (A).
-   An electric charge flows when it has electric potential energy due
    to its position in an electric field. An electric charge always

### Direct Current {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlyZWN0IEN1cnJlbnQ._65-zuw}

When current flows in just one direction, it is called **direct current
(DC)** . The diagram below shows how direct current flows through a
simple circuit. An example of direct current is the current that flows
through a battery-powered flashlight. In addition to batteries, solar
cells and fuel cells can also provide direct current.

### Alternating Current {#6.html#x-ck12-QWx0ZXJuYXRpbmcgQ3VycmVudA.._65-yrz}

When current keeps reversing direction, it is called **alternating
current (AC)** . You can see how it works in the two diagrams below. The
current that comes from a power plant and supplies electricity to homes
and businesses is alternating current. The current changes direction 60
times per second. It happens so quickly that the light bulb doesn’t have
a chance to stop glowing when the reversals occur.

Can you identify the two objects pictured above? You’ve probably used
objects like these many times. The photos show a TV remote (left) and a
calculator (right). Both of them run on electric current. Current
requires a source of voltage, which is a difference in electric
potential energy.

**Q:** The source of voltage is different in the remote and the
calculator. Do you know what source of voltage each device uses?

**A:** The TV remote uses chemical cells as a source of voltage. The
calculator uses a solar cell.

### Chemical Cells {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgQ2VsbHM._66-swr}

**Chemical cells** are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means
of chemical reactions. Chemical cells have two electrodes, which are
strips of different materials, such as zinc and carbon. The electrodes
are suspended in an electrolyte. This is a substance that contains free
ions, which can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a
paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in
which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain
dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells.

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQmF0dGVyeQ..) shows how a
battery works. The diagram represents the simplest type of battery, one
that contains a single chemical cell. Both dry and wet cells work the
same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte,
causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to
accept electrons. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the
negative to positive electrode. The electrodes extend out of the battery
for the attachment of wires that carry the current. The current can be
used to power a light bulb or other electric device.

### Solar Cells {#6.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgQ2VsbHM._66-tcb}

**Solar cells** convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy.
Solar cells are also called photovoltaic (PV) cells because they use
light ( *photo-* ) to produce voltage ( *-voltaic* ). Solar cells
contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy. The energy
knocks electrons loose so they can flow freely and produce a difference
in electric potential energy, or voltage. The flow of electrons creates
electric current. Solar cells have positive and negative contacts, like
the terminals in chemical cells. If the contacts are connected with
wire, current flows from the negative to positive contact. The

These athletes are playing rugby, a game that is similar to American
football. The players in red and blue are trying to stop the player in
blue and black from running across the field with the ball. They are
resisting his forward motion. This example of resistance in rugby is a
little like resistance in physics.

### What Is Resistance? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBSZXNpc3RhbmNlPw.._67-cnh}

In physics, **resistance** is opposition to the flow of electric charges
in an electric current as it travels through matter. The SI unit for
resistance is the ohm. Resistance occurs because moving electrons in
current bump into atoms of matter. Resistance reduces the amount of
electrical energy that is transferred through matter. That’s because
some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to
other forms of energy, such as heat. You can see an animation of
resistance at the level of atoms and electrons at this URL:
[http://www.physics.org/explorelink.asp?id=1738&q=electricalresistance&currentpage=1&age=0&knowledge=0&item=3](explorelink.asp?id=1738&q=electricalresistance&currentpage=1&age=0&knowledge=0&item=3)

**Q:** In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the
players on each team represent?

**A:** The player on the blue and black team represents a moving
electron in an electric current. The players on the red and blue team
represent particles of matter through which the current is flowing.

### Factors That Affect Resistance {#6.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9ycyBUaGF0IEFmZmVjdCBSZXNpc3RhbmNl_67-f3s}

How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type
of material, its width, its length, and its temperature.

-   All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the
    flow of electric current more or less than other materials do.
    Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current.
    They are called electric insulators. Materials such as metals have
    low resistance to electric current. They are called
    electric conductors.
-   A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the
    same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water
    flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than
    a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a
    wide wire than a narrow wire.
-   A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must
    travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for
    it to collide with particles of matter.
-   A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler
    particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly.
    Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons
    in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no
    resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. You
    can learn more about superconductors at this URL:

[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x29bbd\_superconductors\_tech](x29bbd_superconductors_tech)

### Is Resistance Good or Bad? {#6.html#x-ck12-SXMgUmVzaXN0YW5jZSBHb29kIG9yIEJhZD8._67-spq}

Resistance can be helpful or just a drain on electrical energy. If the
aim is to transmit electric current through a wire from one place to
another, then resistance is a drawback. It reduces the amount of
electrical energy that is transmitted because some of the current is
absorbed by particles of matter. On the other hand, if the aim is to use
electricity to produce heat or light, then resistance is useful. When
particles of matter absorb electrical energy, they change it to heat or
light. For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten
wire inside an incandescent light bulb like the one in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTGlnaHRCdWxi) , the tungsten resists the
flow of electric charge. It absorbs electrical energy and converts some
of it to light and heat.

What’s wrong with this picture? (Hint: How does current get to the light
bulb?)

</div>

**Q:** The tungsten wire inside a light bulb is extremely thin. How does
this help it do its job?

**A:** The extremely thin wire has more resistance than a wider wire
would. This helps the wire resist electric current and change it to
light.

    that occurs as electric current travels through matter. The SI unit

Do you see the wires and peaks on top of this old house? They are
lightning rods, and their purpose is to protect the building in the
event of a lightning strike. Each lightning rod is connected to a wire
that goes down the side of the house and into the ground. If lightning
strikes the building, it will target the rod and be conducted by the rod
and wire into the ground. There the electricity can be safely absorbed.
Lightning rods may differ in style, but to work they must be good at
conducting electricity.

### Electric Current and Matter {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgQ3VycmVudCBhbmQgTWF0dGVy_68-xwi}

Electrical energy is transmitted by moving electrons in an electric
current. In order to travel, electric current needs matter. It cannot
pass through empty space. However, matter resists the flow of electric
current. That’s because flowing electrons in current collide with
particles of matter, which absorb their energy. Some types of matter
offer more or less resistance to electric current than others.

### Electric Conductors {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgQ29uZHVjdG9ycw.._68-xh6}

Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called
**electric conductors** . Many metals—including copper, aluminum, and
steel—are good conductors of electricity. The outer electrons of metal
atoms are loosely bound and free to move, allowing electric current to
flow. Water that has even a tiny amount of impurities is an electric
conductor as well.

**Q:** What do you think lightning rods are made of?

**A:** Lightning rods are made of metal, usually copper or aluminum,
both of which are excellent conductors of electricity.

### Electric Insulators {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgSW5zdWxhdG9ycw.._68-ox9}

Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called
**electric insulators** . Examples include most nonmetallic solids, such
as wood, rubber, and plastic. Their atoms hold onto their electrons
tightly, so electric current cannot flow freely through them. Dry air is
also an electric insulator. You can learn more about electric
insulators—as well as how to test whether a material is an insulator—by
doing the activity at this URL:

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks2bitesize/science/physical\_processes/circuits\_conductors/play.shtml](play.shtml)

**Q:** You may have heard that rubber-soled shoes will protect you if
you are struck by lightning. Do you think this is true? Why or why not?

**A:** It isn’t true. Rubber is an electric insulator, but a half-inch
layer on the bottom of a pair of shoes is insignificant when it comes to
lightning. The average lightning bolt has 100 million volts and can burn
through any insulator, even the insulators on high-voltage power lines.

### The Path of Least Resistance {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBhdGggb2YgTGVhc3QgUmVzaXN0YW5jZQ.._68-xze}

Look at the electric wires in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtV2lyZXM.) . They are made of copper and
coated with plastic. Copper is very good conductor, and plastic is a
very good insulator. When more than one material is available for
electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the
material with the least resistance. That’s why all the current passes
through the copper wire and none flows through its plastic coating.

Look at the water spraying out of this garden hose. You have to be
careful using water around power tools and electric outlets because
water can conduct an electric current. But in some ways, water flowing
through a hose is like electric current flowing through a wire.

### Introducing Ohm’s Law {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgT2ht4oCZcyBMYXc._69-la8}

For electric current to flow through a wire, there must be a source of
voltage. Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy. As you
might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current. As electric
current flows through matter, particles of matter resist the moving
charges. This is called resistance, and greater resistance results in
less current. These relationships between electric current, voltage, and
resistance were first demonstrated in the early 1800s by a German
scientist named Georg Ohm, so they are referred to as Ohm’s law. **Ohm’s
law** can be represented by the following equation.

### Understanding Ohm’s Law {#6.html#x-ck12-VW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZyBPaG3igJlzIExhdw.._69-9xc}

Ohm’s law may be easier to understand with an analogy. Current flowing
through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. Increasing voltage
with a higher-volt battery increases the current. This is like opening
the tap wider so more water flows through the hose. Increasing
resistance reduces the current. This is like stepping on the hose so
less water can flow through it. If you still aren’t sure about the
relationships among current, voltage, and resistance, watch the video at

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._69-1xt}

-   According to Ohm’s law, greater voltage results in more current and
    greater resistance results in less current.
-   Ohm’s law can be represented by the equation:

![\\mathrm{Current \\ (amps)} = \\mathrm{\\frac{Voltage \\
(volts)}{Resistance \\
(ohms)}}](ck12_math_images_dir/64812c730a8bee1928390b964fa76c41.png)

-   This equation can be used to calculate current when voltage and
    resistance are known.

Jose made this sketch of a battery and light bulb for science class. If
this were a real set up, the light bulb wouldn’t work. The problem is
the loose wire on the left. It must be connected to the positive
terminal of the battery in order for the bulb to light up.

**Q:** Why does the light bulb need to be connected to both battery
terminals?

**A:** Electric current can flow through a wire only if it forms a
closed loop. Charges must have an unbroken path to follow between the
positively and negatively charged parts of the voltage source, in this
case, the battery.

### Electric Circuit Basics {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgQ2lyY3VpdCBCYXNpY3M._70-uxz}

A closed loop through which current can flow is called an **electric
circuit** . In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits have a voltage
of 120 volts. The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on
the number and power of electrical devices connected to the circuit.
Home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps.

### Parts of an Electric Circuit {#6.html#x-ck12-UGFydHMgb2YgYW4gRWxlY3RyaWMgQ2lyY3VpdA.._70-gca}

All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a
conductor. They may have other parts as well, such as light bulbs and
switches, as in the simple circuit seen in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2xvc2VkQ2lyY3VpdA..) . To see an

**Figure 6.158**

</div>

-   The voltage source of this simple circuit is a battery. In a home
    circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may
    supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community
    or even to many communities.
-   The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The
    conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and
    back again. In the **Figure**
    [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2xvc2VkQ2lyY3VpdA..) , the wires are
    connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a
    closed loop.
-   Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert
    electrical energy to other forms of energy. In the case of a light
    bulb, electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy.
-   Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current. When the
    switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow
    through it. When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and
    current cannot flow through it.

### Circuit Diagrams {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2lyY3VpdCBEaWFncmFtcw.._70-cjh}

When a contractor builds a new home, she uses a set of plans called
blueprints that show her how to build the house. The blueprints include
circuit diagrams. The diagrams show how the wiring and other electrical
components are to be installed in order to supply current to appliances,
lights, and other electric devices. You can see an example of a very
simple circuit in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ2lyY3VpdERpYWdyYW0.) . Different parts
of the circuit are represented by standard circuit symbols. An ammeter
measures the flow of current through the circuit, and a voltmeter
measures the voltage. A resistor is any device that converts some of the
electricity to other forms of energy. For example, a resistor might be a
light bulb or doorbell.

**A:** The battery symbol (or a symbol for some other voltage source)
must be included in every circuit. Without a source of voltage, there is
no electric current.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._70-t9x}

Only a licensed professional electrician like this one is qualified to
install or repair the electrical system inside a home. It’s a
complicated system that consists of a maze of electric circuits.

### One Loop or Two? {#6.html#x-ck12-T25lIExvb3Agb3IgVHdvPw.._71-dpa}

An electric circuit consists of at least one closed loop through which
electric current can flow. Every circuit has a voltage source such as a
battery and a conductor such as metal wire. A circuit may have other
parts as well, such as lights and switches. In addition, a circuit may
consist of one loop or two loops.

### Series Circuit {#6.html#x-ck12-U2VyaWVzIENpcmN1aXQ._71-npl}

A circuit that consists of one loop is called a **series circuit** . You
can see a simple series circuit below. If a series circuit is
interrupted at any point in its single loop, no current can flow through
the circuit and no devices in the circuit will work. In the series
circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb won’t
work because it won’t receive any current. Series circuits are commonly
used in flashlights. You can see an animation of a series circuit at
this URL:

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_6_files/20150911012833043831.png) </span>

**Q:** If one light bulb burns out in this series circuit, how can you
tell which bulb it is?

**A:** It may not be obvious, because neither bulb will light if one is
burned out. You can tell which one it is only by replacing first one
bulb and then the other to see which replacement results in both bulbs
lighting up.

### Parallel Circuit {#6.html#x-ck12-UGFyYWxsZWwgQ2lyY3VpdA.._71-jg9}

A circuit that has two loops is called a **parallel circuit** . A simple
parallel circuit is sketched below. If one loop of a parallel circuit is
interrupted, current can still flow through the other loop. In the
parallel circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light
bulb will still work because current can bypass the burned-out bulb. The
wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits. You can see an
animation of a parallel circuit at this URL:

Miranda has to use a hair dryer in order to dry her long hair quickly
enough to get to school on time. She has a powerful hair dryer that
dries her hair faster than a less powerful hair dryer would. That’s
because a more powerful hair dryer changes electric current to thermal
energy more quickly.

### Electric Power {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgUG93ZXI._72-27z}

The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of
energy is called **electric power** . The SI unit for power—including
electric power—is the watt. A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second.
High wattages are often expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals
1000 watts. The power of an electric device, such as a hair dryer, can
be calculated if you know the voltage of the circuit and how much
current the device receives. The following equation is used:

<dl id="x-ck12-YzliZGM3ZGE5OTZhMWMwMGNlYWY0NGUxMDljODI0OTI.-380">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YzliZGM3ZGE5OTZhMWMwMGNlYWY0NGUxMDljODI0OTI.-geb">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YzliZGM3ZGE5OTZhMWMwMGNlYWY0NGUxMDljODI0OTI.-hig">
<dd>
Power (watts) = Current (amps) × Voltage (volts)

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Assume that Miranda’s hair dryer is the only electric device in a
120-volt circuit that carries 15 amps of current. Then the power of her
hair dryer in kilowatts is:

<dl id="x-ck12-MjZmMTZjODg4MjIyODFhNGJlMWZjNjQ2MjU4YzgxNmQ.-mrk">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MjZmMTZjODg4MjIyODFhNGJlMWZjNjQ2MjU4YzgxNmQ.-zo9">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-MjZmMTZjODg4MjIyODFhNGJlMWZjNjQ2MjU4YzgxNmQ.-z6w">
<dd>
Power = 15 amps × 120 volts = 1800 watts, or 1.8 kilowatts

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
**Q:** If a different hair dryer is plugged into a 120-volt circuit that
carries 10 amps of current. What is the power of the other hair dryer?

**A:** Substitute these values in the power equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-YWUxZGJkZjMyYTdiNjM3MTc2NGI2MmJhN2Q0OTg3MDc.-0bg">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YWUxZGJkZjMyYTdiNjM3MTc2NGI2MmJhN2Q0OTg3MDc.-ktq">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YWUxZGJkZjMyYTdiNjM3MTc2NGI2MmJhN2Q0OTg3MDc.-ku0">
<dd>
Power = 10 amps × 120 volts = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
### Electrical Energy Use {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWNhbCBFbmVyZ3kgVXNl_72-ibi}

Did you ever wonder how much electrical energy it takes to use an
appliance such as a hair dryer? Electrical energy use depends on the
power of the appliance and how long it is used. It can be calculated
with this equation:

<dl id="x-ck12-ODU1OTY5YjU0NzZhZjgyOWNiZTc3OTY5YzMzMDMwZDg.-hga">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ODU1OTY5YjU0NzZhZjgyOWNiZTc3OTY5YzMzMDMwZDg.-pm4">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-ODU1OTY5YjU0NzZhZjgyOWNiZTc3OTY5YzMzMDMwZDg.-hkg">
<dd>
Electrical Energy = Power × Time

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
If Miranda uses her 1.8-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2 hours, how much
electrical energy does she use?

<dl id="x-ck12-NDE4OTAwOTEyNDI3YzZiOGIyODVhZGE3MzNkZGVhYTA.-ma4">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NDE4OTAwOTEyNDI3YzZiOGIyODVhZGE3MzNkZGVhYTA.-ovs">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NDE4OTAwOTEyNDI3YzZiOGIyODVhZGE3MzNkZGVhYTA.-ylv">
<dd>
Electrical Energy = 1.8 kilowatts × 0.2 hours = 0.36 kilowatt-hours

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
Electrical energy use is typically expressed in kilowatt-hours, as in
this example. How much energy is this? One kilowatt-hour equals 3.6
million joules of energy.

**Q:** Suppose Miranda were to use a 1.2-kilowatt hair dryer for 0.2
hours. How much electrical energy would she use then?

**A:** She would use:

<dl id="x-ck12-NDhjZDJlYzRmY2E1Njg1MTg4MWVjMDE3OTc5NWU0NDM.-or8">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NDhjZDJlYzRmY2E1Njg1MTg4MWVjMDE3OTc5NWU0NDM.-327">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NDhjZDJlYzRmY2E1Njg1MTg4MWVjMDE3OTc5NWU0NDM.-nbu">
<dd>
Electrical Energy = 1.2 kilowatts × 0.2 hour = 0.24 kilowatt-hours

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._72-wl4}

-   Electric power is the rate at which a device changes electric
    current to another form of energy. The SI unit of power is the watt.
    Electric power can be calculated as current times voltage.

Electricity isn't really an evil cloud, but the sign makes the point
that electricity is dangerous. Contact with electric current can cause
severe burns and even death. Electricity can also cause serious fires.

**Q:** A common cause of electric hazards and fires is a short circuit.
Do you know what a short circuit is?

**A:** As its name suggests, a short circuit is damage that allows
electric current to travel through a shorter loop than it should. To
find out how this can occur and why it is dangerous, keep reading.

### How a Short Circuit Occurs {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgU2hvcnQgQ2lyY3VpdCBPY2N1cnM._73-uma}

Did you ever see an old appliance with a damaged cord, like the old
shown in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnJheWVkQ29yZA..)
? A damaged electric cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current
to pass from the cord to a person who touches it. A damaged cord can
also cause a short circuit. A short circuit occurs when electric current
follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. An
electric cord contains two wires: one that carries current from the
outlet to the appliance and one that carries current from the appliance
back to the outlet. If the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact
with each other, current flows from one wire to the other and bypasses
the appliance. This may cause the wires to overheat and start a fire.

Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into
modern electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs,
circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. You can read about these three
safety features in the **Figure**

**Figure 6.161**

A Three-Prong Plug is used on metal appliances. The two flat prongs
carry current to and from the appliances. The round prong is for safety.
It connects with a wire inside the outlet that goes down into the
ground. If any stray current leaks from the circuit or if there is a
short circuit, the ground wire carries the current into the ground,
which harmlessly absorbs it.

Circuit Breaker: This electrical panel contains several circuit
breakers. A circuit breaker is a switch that automatically interrupts a
circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too
many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if too many
electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if there is an electric
short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched
back on to complete the circuit so current can flow through it again.

GFCI Outlet: GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI
outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of
water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric
conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amount of
current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is
returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this
occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet interrupts the circuit. The
breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover.

**Q:** Can you think of any other electric safety features?

**A:** One safety feature is the label on a lamp that warns the user of
the maximum safe wattage for light bulbs. Another safety feature is
double insulation on many electric devices. Not only are the electric
wires insulated with a coating of plastic but so is the entire device.
The old toaster pictured in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRnJheWVkQ29yZA..) lacks this safety
feature, but most modern toasters have a plastic casing. This reduces
the risk of current leaving the device except through the cord.

### Using Electricity Safely {#6.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRWxlY3RyaWNpdHkgU2FmZWx5_73-suu}

Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it
is misused. Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury
or fire from electricity.

-   Never mix electricity and water. Don’t plug in or turn on electric
    lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in
    water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could flow
    through the water—and you—because water is a good conductor
    of electricity.
-   Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one
    outlet or extension cord. The more devices that are plugged in, the
    more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a
    circuit and start a fire.
-   Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause
    shocks, shorts, and fires.
-   Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Putting any
    other object into an outlet is likely to cause a serious shock that
    could be fatal.
-   Never go near fallen electric lines. They could have very
    high voltage. Report fallen lines to the electric company as soon
    as possible.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._73-xs1}

-   A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path
    than the intended loop of the circuit. A short circuit may cause
    wires to overheat and start a fire.
-   Several safety features are built into modern electric circuits
    and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and
    GFCI outlets.
-   Following safety rules can reduce the risk of injury or fire
    from electricity.

Did you ever make a secret code by assigning each letter of the alphabet
a unique symbol? The code shown above is believed to have been used by
George Washington to send secret messages during the American
Revolutionary War. A different type of code can be sent with electric
current.

**Q:** How do you think electric current can be used to encode messages?

**A:** The short answer is by changing the voltage in an electric
circuit. Keep reading to learn more.

### Electronic Messages {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb25pYyBNZXNzYWdlcw.._74-max}

Electric devices, such as lights and household appliances, change
electric current to other forms of energy. For example, an electric
stove changes electric current to thermal energy. Other common devices,
such as mobile phones and computers, use electric current for another
purpose: to encode information. A message encoded this way is called an
**electronic signal** , and the use of electric current for this purpose
is called **electronics** . For an overview of electronics and
electronic signals, read the short article at this URL:
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/bitesize/standard/physics/electronics/overview\_rev1.shtml](overview_rev1.shtml)
.

To encode a message with electric current, the voltage is changed
rapidly, over and over again. Voltage is a difference in electric
potential energy that is needed in order for electric current to flow.
There are two different ways voltage can be changed, resulting in two
different types of electronic signals, called analog signals and digital
signals.

### Analog Signals {#6.html#x-ck12-QW5hbG9nIFNpZ25hbHM._74-pzh}

Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric
circuit. The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQW5hbG9n)
represents analog signals. These were the first electronic signals to be
invented. They were used in early computers and other early electronic
devices. Analog signals are subject to distortion and noise, so they
aren’t used as often anymore. They are used mainly in microphones and
some mobile phones to encode sounds as electronic signals.

</div>

### Digital Signals {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlnaXRhbCBTaWduYWxz_74-rp3}

Today, most electronic signals are digital signals. Digital signals
consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly switch the current
off and on. The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlnaXRhbA..)
represents digital signals. This type of signal encodes information as a
string of 0’s (current off) and 1’s (current on). This is called a
binary (“two-digit”) code. The majority of modern electronic devices,
including computers and many mobile phones, encode data as digital
signals. Compared with analog signals, digital signals are easier to
transmit and more accurate.

You’ve probably heard of Silicon Valley. You may even know that it’s a
region in northern California. But do you know how the region got its
name? Silicon Valley is the birthplace of modern electronics and
continues to be a hub of electronic innovation. The word *silicon* in
the name refers to the element silicon, which is the chief “ingredient”
of electronic components.

### What Are Electronic Components? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgRWxlY3Ryb25pYyBDb21wb25lbnRzPw.._75-i1e}

Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as
computers. The components change electric current so it can carry
information. Types of electronic components include diodes, transistors,
and integrated circuits, all of which you can read about below. However,
to understand how these components work, you first need to know about
semiconductors. That’s because electronic components consist of
semiconductors—sometimes millions of them!

### Semiconductors {#6.html#x-ck12-U2VtaWNvbmR1Y3RvcnM._75-vof}

A **semiconductor** is a solid crystal, consisting mainly of silicon. It
gets its name from the fact that it can conduct current better than an
electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. As you can
see in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2VtaWN1bmR1Y3Rvcg..) , each silicon atom
has four valence electrons that it shares with other silicon atoms in
the crystal. A semiconductor is formed by replacing a few silicon atoms
with other atoms, such as phosphorus or boron, which have more or less
valence electrons than silicon. This is called doping, and it’s what
allows the semiconductor to conduct electric current.

silicon](ck12_6_files/20150911012834234156.png "Semiconductors are created by "doping" silicon")

**Figure 6.164**

</div>

**Q:** Why wouldn’t a pure silicon crystal be able to conduct electric
current?

**A:** Electric current is a flow of electrons. All of the valence
electrons of silicon atoms in a pure crystal are shared with other
silicon atoms, so they are not free to move and carry current.

There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type.

-   An n-type (negative-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an
    element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal
    extra electrons. You can see this in the **Figure**
    [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2VtaWN1bmR1Y3Rvcg..) . An n-type
    semiconductor is like the negative terminal of a battery.
-   A p-type (positive-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an
    element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged
    “holes” where electrons are missing. This is also shown in the
    **Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU2VtaWN1bmR1Y3Rvcg..) . A
    p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal of a battery.

### Diode {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlvZGU._75-jxr}

A diode is an electronic component that consists of a p-type and an
n-type semiconductor placed side by side, as shown in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGlvZGU.) . When a diode is connected by
leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the
p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow
in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current
to direct current.

</div>

### Transistor {#6.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNpc3Rvcg.._75-r8o}

A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p-n-p or n-p-n.
Both arrangements are illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJhbnNpc3Rvcg..) . Current can’t flow
through a transistor unless a small amount of current is applied to the
center semiconductor (through the base). Then a much larger current can
flow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to emitter).
This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a
small current turning a larger current on and off. A transistor can also
be used to increase the amount of current flowing through a circuit. You
can learn more about transistors and how they work at this URL:

### Integrated Circuit {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50ZWdyYXRlZCBDaXJjdWl0_75-hym}

An integrated circuit—also called a microchip—is a tiny, flat piece of
silicon that consists of layers of many electronic components such as
transistors. You can see an integrated circuit in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWljcm9jaGlw) . Look how small it is
compared with the finger it’s resting on. Although the integrated
circuit is tiny, it may contain millions of smaller electronic
components. Current flows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit
because it doesn’t have far to travel. Integrated circuits are used in
virtually all modern electronic devices to carry out specific tasks. You
can see how integrated circuits are made at this URL:

If you were born in the last few decades, it’s probably impossible for
you to imagine life without the computer. The computer is just one of
many electronic devices that make modern life possible.

### What are Electronic Devices? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgRWxlY3Ryb25pYyBEZXZpY2VzPw.._76-t5q}

Many of the devices people commonly use today are electronic devices.
**Electronic devices** use electric current to encode, analyze, or
transmit information. In addition to computers, they include mobile
phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, and digital cameras, to name
just a few.

**Q:** Can you think of other electronic devices that you use?

**A:** Other examples include game systems and MP3 players.

### Focus on the Computer {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9jdXMgb24gdGhlIENvbXB1dGVy_76-v5n}

Let’s take a close look at the computer as an example of an electronic
device. A computer contains integrated circuits, or microchips, that
consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is
encoded in digital electronic signals. Rapid pulses of voltage switch
electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1’s (current on)
and 0’s (current off). The 1’s and 0’s are the “letters” of the code,
and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is
called a bit, which stands for “binary digit.” Each group of eight
digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte.
Because a computer’s circuits are so tiny and close together, the
computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while
remaining small.

The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals
are pictured and described in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29tcHV0ZXJQYXJ0cw..) . They include the
CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of
the computer together.

instructions in the word processing program, and you are probably using
the hard drive to save your document.

The train in this photo is called a maglev train. The word *maglev*
stands for “magnetic levitation.” Magnets push the train upward so it
hovers, or levitates, above the track without actually touching it. This
eliminates most of the friction acting against the train when it moves.
Other magnets pull the train forward along the track. Because of all the
magnets, the train can go very fast. It can fly over the tracks at
speeds up to 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour! What are magnets and
how do they exert such force? In this article, you’ll find out. You can

the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWFnbmV0) . Like all
magnets, this bar magnet has north and south **magnetic poles** . The
red end of the magnet is the north pole and the blue end is the south
pole. The poles are regions where the magnet is strongest. The poles are
called north and south because they always line up with Earth’s
north-south axis if the magnet is allowed to move freely. (Earth’s axis
is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates.)

**Q:** What do you suppose would happen if you cut the bar magnet
pictured in the **Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWFnbmV0)
along the line between the north and south poles?

**A:** Both halves of the magnet would also have north and south poles.
If you cut each of the halves in half, all those pieces would have north
and south poles as well. Pieces of a magnet always have both north and
south poles no matter how many times you cut the magnet.

### Magnetic Force and Magnetic Field {#6.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0aWMgRm9yY2UgYW5kIE1hZ25ldGljIEZpZWxk_77-5gd}

The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials, including other
magnets, is called **magnetic force** . The force is exerted over a
distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. North and
south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or
two south poles repel each other. A magnet can exert force over a
distance because the magnet is surrounded by a **magnetic field** . In
the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtSXJvbkZpbGxpbmdz) , you
can see the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron,
called iron filings, were placed under a sheet of glass. When the magnet
was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron filings. The pattern of
the iron filings shows the lines of force that make up the magnetic
field of the magnet. The concentration of iron filings near the poles
indicates that these areas exert the strongest force. You can also see
how the magnetic field affects the compasses placed above the magnet. To

    All magnets have north and south magnetic poles. The poles are
    regions where the magnet is strongest.
-   The force that a magnet exerts is called magnetic force. The force
    is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction
    and repulsion. A magnet can exert force over a distance because the

This collection of magnets is located in a familiar place: a
refrigerator door. No doubt you’ve handled refrigerator magnets like the
ones in this photo. You probably know first-hand that they stick to
metal refrigerators but not to surfaces such as wooden doors and glass
windows. Wood and glass aren’t attracted to a magnet, whereas the steel
refrigerator is. Obviously, only certain materials respond to magnetic
force.

### What Makes a Material Magnetic? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBNYWtlcyBhIE1hdGVyaWFsIE1hZ25ldGljPw.._78-fmx}

**Magnetism** is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet
and to act as a magnet. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons
within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an
atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south
poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the north and south poles
of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the material is
not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass,
plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted
to magnets and cannot become magnets.

In other materials, there are regions where the north and south poles of
atoms are all lined up in the same direction. These regions are called
**magnetic domains** . Generally, the magnetic domains point in
different directions, so the material is still not magnetic. However,
the material can be magnetized (made into a magnet) by placing it in a
magnetic field. When this happens, all the magnetic domains line up, and
the material becomes a magnet. You can see this in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRG9tYWlucw..) . Materials that can be
magnitized are called **ferromagnetic materials** . They include iron,
cobalt, and nickel.

**Figure 6.172**

Magnetic domains must be lined up by an outside magnetic field for most
ferromagnetic materials to become magnets.

</div>

### Temporary and Permanent Magnets {#6.html#x-ck12-VGVtcG9yYXJ5IGFuZCBQZXJtYW5lbnQgTWFnbmV0cw.._78-spp}

Materials that have been magnetized may become temporary or permanent
magnets.

-   If you bring a bar magnet close to pile of paper clips, the paper
    clips will become temporarily magnetized, as all their magnetic
    domains line up. As a result, the paper clips will stick to the
    magnet and also to each other (see the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGFwZXJjbGlwcw..) ). However, if you
    remove the paper clips from the bar magnet’s magnetic field, their
    magnetic domains will no longer align. As a result, the paper clips
    will no longer be magnetized or stick together. You can follow the
    five easy steps at the following URL to make a temporary magnet from
    a paper clip that will retain its magnetism somewhat longer.

    done in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTmFpbA..) .
    The nail’s magnetic domains will remain aligned even after you
    remove the nail from the magnetic field of the bar magnet.

</div>

**Q:** Even permanent magnets can be demagnetized if they are dropped or
heated to high temperatures. Can you explain why?

**A:** Jarring or heating a magnet moves the magnetic domains out of
alignment. When the magnetic domains no longer line up in the same
direction, the material is no longer magnetic.

### Magnetite {#6.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0aXRl_78-cbq}

Some materials are natural permanent magnets. The most magnetic material
in nature is the mineral magnetite, also called lodestone (see
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWFnbmV0aXRl) ). The magnetic
domains of magnetite naturally align with Earth’s axis. The picture on
the left shows a chunk of magnetite attracting small bits of iron. The
magnetite spoon compass shown on the right dates back about 2000 years
and comes from China. The handle of the spoon always points north.
Clearly, the magnetic properties of magnetite have been recognized for
thousands of years.

Did you ever use a compass like the one in this picture? Even if you’ve
never used a compass, you probably know that the needle of a compass
always points north. That’s because a compass needle is magnetized, so
it is attracted by a magnet.

**Q:** What magnet attracts a compass needle?

**A:** A compass needle is attracted by magnet Earth. It always points
north because Earth acts as a giant magnet.

### Earth’s Magnetic Poles {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIE1hZ25ldGljIFBvbGVz_79-p25}

Imagine a huge bar magnet passing through Earth’s axis, as in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWFydGhNYWduZXQ.) . This is a
good representation of Earth as a magnet. Like a bar magnet, Earth has
north and south magnetic poles. A **magnetic pole** is the north or
south end of a magnet, where the magnet exerts the most force.

### Two North Poles {#6.html#x-ck12-VHdvIE5vcnRoIFBvbGVz_79-jgo}

Although the needle of a compass always points north, it doesn’t point
to Earth’s north geographic pole. Find the north geographic pole in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV84XzNfUG9sZXM.) . As you can
see, it is located at 90° north latitude. Where does a compass needle
point instead? It points to Earth’s north magnetic pole, which is
located at about 80° north latitude. Earth also has two south poles: a
south geographic pole and a south magnetic pole.

</div>

**Q:** The north end of a compass needle points toward Earth’s north
magnetic pole. The like poles of two magnets repel each other, and the
opposite poles attract. So why doesn’t the north end of a compass needle
point to Earth’s south magnetic pole instead?

**A:** The answer may surprise you. The compass needle actually does
point to the south pole of magnet Earth. However, it is called the north
magnetic pole because it is close to the north geographic pole. This
naming convention was adopted a long time ago to avoid confusion.

### Earth’s Magnetic Field {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIE1hZ25ldGljIEZpZWxk_79-nx0}

Like all magnets, Earth has a magnetic field. Earth’s magnetic field is
called the **magnetosphere** . You can see a model of the magnetosphere
in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV84XzNfRmllbGQ.) . It
is a huge region that extends outward from Earth in all directions.
Earth exerts magnetic force over the entire field, but the force is
strongest at the poles, where lines of force converge. For an animated
model of the magnetosphere, watch this video:

Do you like science fiction? This is a fictional scene that is set in
the future. Science fiction artists are so creative! They might even
describe a time when compasses point south instead of north. Actually,
this idea isn’t fiction—it’s a fact.

### Changing Places {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2hhbmdpbmcgUGxhY2Vz_80-ixu}

Earth’s magnetic poles have switched places repeatedly in the past. As
you can see in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmV2ZXJzZWRQb2xlcw..) , each time the
switch occurred, Earth’s magnetic field was reversed. The **magnetic
field** is the region around a magnet over which it exerts magnetic
force. We think of today’s magnetic field direction as “normal,” but
that’s only because it’s what we’re used to. You can watch a simulation

Scientists don’t know for certain why magnetic reversals occur, but
there is hard evidence that they have for hundreds of millions of years.
The evidence comes from rocks on the ocean floor. Look at **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUmlkZ2VTcHJlYWRpbmc.) . They show the
same ridge on the ocean floor during different periods of time.

**A.** At the center of the ridge, hot magma pushes up through the crust
and hardens into rock. Once the magma hardens, the alignment of magnetic
domains in the rock is frozen in place forever. Magnetic domains are
regions in the rocks where all the atoms are lined up and pointing
toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.

**B.** The newly hardened rock is gradually pushed away from the ridge
in both directions as more magma erupts and newer rock forms. The
alignment of magnetic domains in this new rock is in the opposite
direction, showing that a magnetic reversal has occurred.

**C.** A magnetic reversal occurs again. It is frozen in rock to
document the change.

Rock samples from many places on the ocean floor show that the north and
south magnetic poles reversed hundreds of times over the last 330
million years. The last reversal was less than a million years ago.

**Q:** What might happen if a magnetic reversal occurred in your
lifetime? How might it affect you?

Did you ever see a globe like this one? Magnets in the globe and its
stand repel each other, allowing the globe to hover in midair. The globe
is a good model for Earth the magnet.  

### Earth the Magnet {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGggdGhlIE1hZ25ldA.._81-n8u}

Like the real Earth, the globe pictured above is a magnet. A **magnet**
is an object that has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic
field. The magnetic globe is a modern device, but the idea that Earth is
a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British
physician named William Gilbert. He used a spherical magnet to represent
Earth. With a compass, he demonstrated that it the spherical magnet
causes a compass needle to behave the same way that Earth causes a
compass needle to behave. This showed that a spherical magnet is a good
model for Earth and therefore that Earth is a magnet.

**Q:** Can you describe Earth’s magnetic poles and magnetic field?

**A:** Earth has north and south magnetic poles. The North Pole is
located at about 80 degrees north latitude. The magnetic field is an
area around Earth that is affected by its magnetic field. The field is
strongest at the poles, and lines of magnetic force move from the north
to the south magnetic pole.

### Spinning Like a Top {#6.html#x-ck12-U3Bpbm5pbmcgTGlrZSBhIFRvcA.._81-pd6}

Although the idea that Earth is a magnet is centuries old, the discovery
of why Earth is a magnet is a relatively new. In the early 1900s,
scientists started using seismographic data to learn about Earth’s inner
structure. A seismograph detects and measure earthquake waves. Evidence
from earthquakes showed that Earth has a solid inner core and a liquid
outer core (see the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtUFMtNS04LTUtU3Bpbm5pbmc.) ). The outer core
consists of molten metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that
Earth’s magnetic field is generated by the movement of charged particles
through these molten metals in the outer core. The particles move as
Earth spins on its axis. The video at the URL below takes a closer look
at how this occurs.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._81-5lq}

-   In the 1600s, William Gilbert demonstrated that Earth is basically a
    spherical magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field.
-   In the 1900s, scientists used earthquake data to determine that
    Earth has a solid inner core and molten outer core. Scientists think
    that Earth is a magnet because of charged particles moving through
    the molten outer core as Earth spins on its axis.

You may recognize the eerie green glow in this cold northern sky as the
northern lights, or aurora borealis. But do you know what causes the
northern lights? Earth’s magnetic field is a major factor.

### Earth’s Magnetic Field {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIE1hZ25ldGljIEZpZWxk_82-rts}

Like a bar magnet, planet Earth has north and south magnetic poles and a
**magnetic field** over which it exerts magnetic force. Earth’s magnetic
field is called the magnetosphere. You can see it in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU29sYXJXaW5k) .

wind](ck12_6_files/20150911012837554801.jpeg "Diagram illustrating the deflection of the solar wind")

**Figure 6.182**

</div>

### Like an Umbrella {#6.html#x-ck12-TGlrZSBhbiBVbWJyZWxsYQ.._82-tmx}

The sun gives off radiation in solar winds. You can see solar winds in
the **Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU29sYXJXaW5k) . Notice
what happens to solar winds when they reach the magnetosphere. They are
deflected almost completely by Earth’s magnetic field. Radiation in
solar wind would wash over Earth and kill most living things were it not
for the magnetosphere. It protects Earth’s organisms from radiation like
an umbrella protects you from rain.

**Q:** Now can you explain the northern lights?

**A:** Energetic particles in solar wind collide with atoms in the
atmosphere over the poles, and energy is released in the form of light.
The swirling patterns of light follow lines of magnetic force in the
magnetosphere.

### Finding the Way {#6.html#x-ck12-RmluZGluZyB0aGUgV2F5_82-ibs}

Another benefit of Earth’s magnetic field is its use for navigation.
People use compasses to detect Earth’s magnetic north pole and tell
direction. Many animals have natural “compasses” that work just as well.
For example, the loggerhead turtle in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHVydGxlcw..) senses the direction and
strength of Earth’s magnetic field and uses it to navigate along
migration routes. Many migratory bird species can also sense the
magnetic field and use it for navigation. Recent research suggests that
they may have structures in their eyes that let them see Earth’s
magnetic field as a visual pattern. You can learn more at this URL:

What a clever dog! He wants to go inside to get out of the rain, so he’s
ringing the doorbell. Does your home have a doorbell? Did you ever
wonder how a doorbell works? The answer is electromagnetism.

### What Is Electromagnetism? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBFbGVjdHJvbWFnbmV0aXNtPw.._83-h3w}

**Electromagnetism** is magnetism produced by an electric current. When
electric current flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field that
surrounds the wire in circles. You can see this in the diagram below.
Note that electric current is conventionally shown moving from positive
to negative electric potential, as in this diagram. However, electrons
in current actually flow in the opposite direction, from negative to
positive potential.

<span class="x-ck12-img-inline"> <!-- @@author="" -->
<!-- @@license="" --> ![](ck12_6_files/20150911012837913241.png) </span>

**Q:** If more current flows through a wire, how might this affect the
magnetic field surrounding the wire?

**A:** With more current, the magnetic field is stronger.

### Right Hand Rule {#6.html#x-ck12-UmlnaHQgSGFuZCBSdWxl_83-tdr}

The direction of the magnetic field created when current flows through a
wire depends on the direction of the current. A simple rule, called the
right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic
field if the direction of the current is known. The rule is illustrated
in the **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUkhSdWxl) . When the
thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the
current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the
direction of the magnetic field. You can see the right hand rule in
action at this URL:

### Uses of Electromagnetism {#6.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBFbGVjdHJvbWFnbmV0aXNt_83-qcu}

Electromagnetism is used not only in a doorbells but in many other
electric devices as well, such as electric motors and loudspeakers. It
is also used to store information on computer disks. An important
medical use of electromagnetism is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
This is a technique for making images of the inside of the body in order
to diagnose diseases or injuries. Magnetism created with electric
current is so useful because it can be turned on or off simply by
turning the current on or off. The strength of the magnetic field is
also easy to control by changing the amount of current. You can’t do
either of these things with a regular magnet.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._83-vej}

-   Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current.
    Current flowing through a wire creates a magnetic field that
    surrounds the wire in concentric circles.
-   When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction
    as the current flowing through a wire, the fingers of the right hand
    curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.
-   Electromagnetism is very useful because it can be turned on or off
    by turning the current on or off, and it can be made stronger or
    weaker by using more or less current.

Tamara made the simple device in this picture for science class. She
wrapped a wire around a nail and connected the ends of the wire to the
terminals of a battery. The nail is attracting paper clips, so it
appears to have become magnetized. The device isn’t complicated, but it

**Q:** What does Tamara’s device show?

**A:** The device shows that you can use electricity to create
magnetism.

### Electricity and Magnetism {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWNpdHkgYW5kIE1hZ25ldGlzbQ.._84-45y}

Magnetism produced by electricity is called **electromagnetism** .
Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric devices. However, until
electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and
magnetism were unrelated. A Danish scientist named Hans Christian
Oersted (pictured in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtT2Vyc3RlZA..) ) changed all that. He made
the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic field.
But like many other important discoveries in science, Oersted’s
discovery was just a lucky accident.

### An Accidental Discovery {#6.html#x-ck12-QW4gQWNjaWRlbnRhbCBEaXNjb3Zlcnk._84-vxo}

In 1820, Oersted was presenting a demonstration to some science
students. Ironically, he was trying to show them that electricity and
magnetism are *not* related. He placed a wire with electric current
flowing through it next to a compass, which has a magnetic needle. As he
expected, the needle of the compass didn’t move. It just kept pointing
toward Earth’s north magnetic pole.

After the demonstration, a curious student held the wire near the
compass again, but in a different direction. To Oersted’s surprise, the
needle of the compass swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing
north. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to
see what would happen to the compass needle. The needle swung back to
its original position, pointing north once again. Oersted had discovered
that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field
created by the current was strong enough to attract the needle of the
nearby compass.

### Oersted Learns More {#6.html#x-ck12-T2Vyc3RlZCBMZWFybnMgTW9yZQ.._84-5vx}

Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic field created by a
current. He placed a compass at different locations around a wire with
current flowing through it. You can see what he found in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTWFnbmV0Q3VycmVudA..) . The lines of
magnetic force circle around the wire in a counterclockwise direction.

### From Magnets to Electricity {#6.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBNYWduZXRzIHRvIEVsZWN0cmljaXR5_84-ppt}

Just about a decade after Oersted discovered that electric current can
produce a magnetic field, an English scientist named Michael Faraday
discovered that the opposite is also true. A magnetic field can produce
an electric current. This is known as Faraday’s law. The process by
which a magnetic field produces current is called electromagnetic
induction. It occurs when a conductor, such as a wire, crosses lines of
force in a magnetic field. This can happen when a wire is moving
relative to a magnet or a magnet is moving relative to a wire.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._84-qwh}

-   Electricity can be used to produce a magnetic field. Magnetism
    produced by electricity is called electromagnetism.
-   In 1820, Oersted discovered by accident that electric current
    creates a magnetic field. Prior to that, scientists thought that
    electricity and magnetism were unrelated.
-   Oersted also used a compass to find the direction of the magnetic
    field around a wire carrying current.
-   Around 1830, Michael Faraday discovered that a magnetic field can
    generate an electric current if a conductor crosses the lines of
    force in a magnetic field. This is known as Faraday’s law.

### Strength of a Solenoid {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RyZW5ndGggb2YgYSBTb2xlbm9pZA.._85-0d2}

Any wire with current flowing through it has a magnetic field. However,
the magnetic field around a coiled wire is stronger than the magnetic
field around a straight wire. That’s because each turn of the wire in
the coil has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns to the coil of
wire increases the strength of the field. Increasing the amount of
current flowing through the coil also increases the strength of the
magnetic field.

### Uses of Solenoids {#6.html#x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBTb2xlbm9pZHM._85-sjp}

A solenoid is generally used to convert electromagnetic energy into
motion. Solenoids are often used in devices that need a sudden burst of
power to move a specific part. In addition to paintball markers, you can
find solenoids in machines ranging from motor vehicles to electric
dishwashers. Another device that uses solenoids is pictured in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtUGluYmFsbA..) .

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._85-wnb}

-   A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through
    it, giving it north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field.
-   Using more turns of wire in the coil or more current increases the
    strength of the solenoid’s magnetic field.
-   A solenoid converts electromagnetic energy into motion, providing a
    burst of power that can move a specific part of a device.

This crane is dangling a big round magnet that has picked up metal car
parts in a junk yard. The parts practically leap up to the magnet
because it’s so strong. That’s because it’s an electromagnet.

### What Is an Electromagnet? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFbGVjdHJvbWFnbmV0Pw.._86-cdh}

An **electromagnet** is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other
ferromagnetic material. A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric
current flowing through it. This gives the coil north and south magnetic
poles and a magnetic field. The magnetic field of the solenoid
magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. You can see
this in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldA..) . You can learn how
to make an electromagnet at this URL:

### Strength of an Electromagnet {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RyZW5ndGggb2YgYW4gRWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldA.._86-dhr}

The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar
makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the
strongest magnets made. An electromagnet is stronger if there are more
turns in the coil of wire or there is more current flowing through it. A
bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also
increases an electromagnet’s strength. At the following URL, you can see
an animation demonstrating how these factors affect the strength of an
electromagnet.
[http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/Electromagnet/index.html](index.html)

### Easy On and Off {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFzeSBPbiBhbmQgT2Zm_86-pra}

Besides their strength, another pro of electromagnets is the ability to
control them by controlling the electric current. Turning the current on
or off turns the magnetic field on or off. The amount of current flowing
through the coil can also be changed to control the strength of the
electromagnet.

**Q:** Why might it be useful to be able to turn an electromagnet on and
off?

**A:** Look back at the electromagnet hanging from the crane in the
opening photo. It is useful to turn on its magnetic field so it can pick
up the metal car parts. It is also useful to turn off its magnetic field
so it can drop the parts into the train car.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._86-low}

-   An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other
    ferromagnetic material. The magnetic field of the solenoid
    magnetizes the iron bar.
-   The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar
    makes an electromagnet very strong.
-   Electromagnets can be turned on or off and their strength can be
    changed by controlling the electric current.

The little boy on the left is pressing the doorbell on his playhouse.
The doorbell is connected to a battery, so it actually rings when he
pushes the button. The little girl on the right is using a hand-held fan
to cool off on a hot day. The fan is also battery-operated, and the
blades of the fan turn in a blur of motion. What do the doorbell and fan
have in common? Both of them work because they contain electromagnets.

### Devices with Electromagnets {#6.html#x-ck12-RGV2aWNlcyB3aXRoIEVsZWN0cm9tYWduZXRz_87-nb7}

Many common electric devices contain electromagnets. An
**electromagnet** is a coil of wire wrapped around a bar of iron or
other ferromagnetic material. When electric current flows through the
wire, it causes the coil and iron bar to become magnetized. An
electromagnet has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field.
Turning off the current turns off the electromagnet. To understand how
electromagnets are used in electric devices, we’ll focus on two common
devices: doorbells and electric motors like the one that turns the
blades of a fan.

**Q:** Besides doorbells and fans, what are some other devices that
contain electromagnets?

**A:** Any device that has an electric motor contains electromagnets.
Some other examples include hairdryers, CD players, power drills,
electric saws, and electric mixers.

### How a Doorbell Works {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgRG9vcmJlbGwgV29ya3M._87-vz5}

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRG9vcmJlbGw.) represents a
simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the
front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come
together and complete an electric circuit. In other words, the button is
a switch. The circuit is also connected to a source of current, an
electromagnet, and a clapper that strikes a bell. You can see an
animation of a doorbell at this URL:
[http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/Electric\_bell/index.html](index.html)

![Schematic illustrating how a doorbell
works](ck12_6_files/20150911012839648168.png "Schematic illustrating how a doorbell works")

**Figure 6.190**

</div>

What happens when current flows through the doorbell circuit?

-   The electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts
    the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making
    it ring.
-   Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike
    the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the
    circuit, the electromagnet turns off, and the clapper returns to its
    original position.
-   When the clapper moves back to its original position, this closes
    the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The
    electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell
    once more.
-   This sequence of events keeps repeating.

**Q:** How can you stop the sequence of events so the doorbell will stop
ringing?

**A:** Stop pressing the button! This interrupts the circuit so no
current can flow through it.

### Electric Motor {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgTW90b3I._87-7zk}

An **electric motor** is a device that uses an electromagnet to change
electrical energy to kinetic energy. You can see a simple diagram of an
electric motor in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtTW90b3I.) . The motor contains an
electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through
the motor, the electromagnet rotates, causing the shaft to rotate as
well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. For example,
in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of the fan. You
can make a very simple electric motor by following the instructions at
this URL:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhaYLnjkf1E](watch?v=VhaYLnjkf1E)

**Figure 6.191**

</div>

Why does the motor’s electromagnet rotate?

-   The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of
    two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet,
    it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles
    of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to rotate
    toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets.
-   A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the
    current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed
    poles are again repelled by the poles of the permanent magnets,
    which have not reversed. This causes the electromagnet to continue
    to rotate.
-   These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet
    rotates continuously.

The girl on the left in this photo is riding a stationary bike. She’s
getting exercise, but that’s not the real reason she’s riding the bike.
She’s using her muscle power to generate electricity through a process
called electromagnetic induction.

### What Is Electromagnetic Induction? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBFbGVjdHJvbWFnbmV0aWMgSW5kdWN0aW9uPw.._88-zbw}

**Electromagnetic induction** is the process of generating electric
current with a magnetic field. It occurs whenever a magnetic field and
an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one
another. As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current
will flow through it whenever it crosses lines of force in the magnetic
field. One way this can happen is illustrated in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29pbE1hZ25ldA..) . The sketch shows a
magnet moving through a wire coil. You can watch an animated version of

**Figure 6.192**

</div>

**Q:** What is another way that a coil of wire and magnet can move
relative to one another and generate an electric current?

**A:** The coil of wire could be moved back and forth over the magnet.

### The Current Produced by a Magnet {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEN1cnJlbnQgUHJvZHVjZWQgYnkgYSBNYWduZXQ._88-gkd}

The device with the pointer in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQ29pbE1hZ25ldA..) is an ammeter. It
measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet
or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If
more turns were added to the coil or a stronger magnet were used, this
would produce more current as well.

The **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtQUM.) shows the direction
of the current that is generated by a moving magnet. If the magnet is
moved back and forth repeatedly, the current keeps changing direction.
In other words, alternating current (AC) is produced. Alternating
current is electric current that keeps reversing direction.

### How Electromagnetic Induction Is Used {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVsZWN0cm9tYWduZXRpYyBJbmR1Y3Rpb24gSXMgVXNlZA.._88-hya}

Two important devices depend on electromagnetic induction: electric
generators and electric transformers. Both devices play critical roles
in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our
daily lives. Electric generators use electromagnetic induction to change
kinetic energy to electrical energy. They produce electricity in power
plants. Electric transformers use electromagnetic induction to change
the voltage of electric current. Some transformers increase voltage and
other decrease voltage.

**Q:** How do you think the girl on the exercise bike in the opening
photo is using electromagnetic induction?

**A:** As she pedals the bike, the kinetic energy of the turning pedals
is used to move a conductor through a magnetic field. This generates
electric current by electromagnetic induction.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._88-att}

-   Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric
    current with a magnetic field. It occurs whenever a magnetic field
    and an electric conductor move relative to one another so the
    conductor crosses lines of force in the magnetic field.
-   The current produced by electromagnetic induction is greater when
    the magnet or coil moves faster, the coil has more turns, or the
    magnet is stronger. If the magnet or coil is moved back and forth
    repeatedly, alternating current is produced.
-   Electric generators and electric transformers use electromagnetic
    induction to generate electricity or change the voltage of
    electric current.

The sprawling machines in this plant aren’t factory machines, but they
do produce something. They are electric generators in a hydroelectric
power plant, and they produce electricity.

### Generating Electricity {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXJhdGluZyBFbGVjdHJpY2l0eQ.._89-dkc}

An **electric generator** is a device that changes kinetic energy to
electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. Electromagnetic
induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic
field. It occurs when a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such
as a coil of wire, move relative to one another.

A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtR2VuZXJhdG9y) . In any electric
generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. The turning
shaft causes a coil of wire to rotate between the opposite poles of a
magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric
current is generated in the wire. You can learn how to make a very
simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making
your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.

**Q:** What might happen to the current produced by an electric
generator if the poles of the magnet kept reversing?

**A:** The direction of the current would also keep reversing. In other
words, the electric generator would generate alternating current.

### From Kinetic to Electrical Energy {#6.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBLaW5ldGljIHRvIEVsZWN0cmljYWwgRW5lcmd5_89-6ic}

Generators may be set up to produce either direct or alternating
current. Generators in cars and most power plants produce alternating
current. Regardless of the type of current, all generators change
kinetic energy to electrical energy.

-   A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy
    of the turning crankshaft. The electricity is used to run the car’s
    lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices. Some of
    the electricity is stored in the car’s battery to provide electrical
    energy when the car isn’t running.
-   A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy
    of a turning turbine. The energy to turn the turbine may come from
    burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source. You can
    see how falling water is used to generate electricity in a
    hydroelectric power plant in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtRGFt) .

because of gravity. Potential energy is stored in the water because of
its position behind the dam. When the water flows into the intake pipe,
gravity pulls it downhill to the power plant.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._89-wg0}

You’ve probably noticed big drums like this one at the tops of electric
poles. A pole close to your home is likely to have one. The drum is an
electric transformer. Without it, the current entering your home would
have too much voltage for your home’s electric circuits to handle.  

### What Is an Electric Transformer? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFbGVjdHJpYyBUcmFuc2Zvcm1lcj8._90-mwp}

An **electric transformer** is a device that uses electromagnetic
induction to change the voltage of electric current. Electromagnetic
induction is the process of generating current with a magnetic field. It
occurs when a magnetic field and electric conductor, such as a coil of
wire, move relative to one another. A transformer may either increase or
decrease voltage. You can see the basic components of an electric
transformer in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJhbnNmb3JtZXI.) . For an animation
showing how a transformer works, go to this URL:

**Figure 6.196**

</div>

The transformer in the diagram consists of two wire coils wrapped around
an iron core. Each coil is part of a different circuit. When alternating
current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core. Because the
current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps
reversing. This is where electromagnetic induction comes in. The
changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S of the
other circuit.

### Stepping Up or Stepping Down {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHBpbmcgVXAgb3IgU3RlcHBpbmcgRG93bg.._90-mfl}

Notice that coil P and coil S in the **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtVHJhbnNmb3JtZXI.) have the same number of
turns of wire. In this case, the voltages of the primary and secondary
currents are the same. Usually, the two coils of a transformer have
different numbers of turns. In that case, the voltages of the two
currents are different.

-   When coil S has more turns than coil P, the voltage in the secondary
    current is greater than the voltage in the primary current (see
    **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RlcFVw) ). This type of
    transformer is called a step-up transformer. That’s because it steps
    up, or increases, the voltage.

-   When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the
    secondary current is less than the voltage in the primary current
    (see **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFMtU3RlcERvd24.) ). This
    type of transformer is called a step-down transformer because it
    steps down, or decreases, the voltage.

**Q:** Both step-up and step-down transformers are used in the
electrical grid that carries electricity from a power plant to your
home. Where in the grid do you think step-down transformers might be
used?

**A:** One place that step-down transformers are used is on the electric
poles that supply current to homes. They reduce the voltage of the
electric current before it enters home circuits.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._90-mni}

-   An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic
    induction to change the voltage of an electric current.
-   A step-up transformer increases voltage. A step-down transformer

These electric power towers carry high-voltage electric lines. The lines
transmit electricity from power plants to homes like yours. The towers
are a crucial part of the electrical grid.

### What Is an Electrical Grid? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFbGVjdHJpY2FsIEdyaWQ__91-gbi}

An **electrical grid** is the entire electrical system that generates,
transmits, and distributes electric power throughout a region or
country. A very simple electrical grid is sketched in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV85XzlfUG93ZXJfR3JpZA..) . The grid
includes a power plant, transmission lines, and electric substations,
all of which work together to provide alternating current to customers.

distribution in the U.S., go to this URL:

### Power Plants {#6.html#x-ck12-UG93ZXIgUGxhbnRz_91-zkp}

Electricity originates in power plants. They have electric generators
that produce electricity by electromagnetic induction. In this process,
a changing magnetic field is used to generate electric current. The
generators convert kinetic energy to electrical energy. The kinetic
energy may come from flowing water, burning fuel, wind, or some other
energy source.

### Transmission Lines {#6.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNtaXNzaW9uIExpbmVz_91-luo}

Transmission lines on big towers—like those in the opening photo
above—carry high-voltage electric current from power plants to electric
substations. Smaller towers and individual power poles carry
lower-voltage current from electric substations to homes and businesses.

### Electric Substations {#6.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3RyaWMgU3Vic3RhdGlvbnM._91-qus}

Electric substations have several functions. Many substations distribute
electricity from a few high-voltage lines to several lower-voltage
lines. They have electric transformers, which use electromagnetic
induction to change the voltage of the current. Some transformers
increase the voltage; others decrease the voltage. In the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV85XzlfVHJhbnNmb3JtZXJz) , you can see
how both types of transformers are used in an electrical grid.

**Figure 6.200**

</div>

-   A step-up transformer increases the voltage of the current as it
    leaves the power plant. After the voltage has been increased, less
    current travels through the high-voltage power lines. This reduces
    the amount of power that is lost due to resistance of the
    power lines.
-   A step-down transformer decreases the voltage of the current so it
    can be distributed safely to businesses and homes. A high-voltage
    power line may have 750,000 volts, whereas most home circuits have a
    maximum of 240 volts. Therefore, one or more step-down transformers
    are needed to decrease the voltage of current before it
    enters homes.

**Q:** Assume that a home needs a 14-volt circuit for a light and a
120-volt circuit for a microwave oven. If the main power line entering
home has 240 volts, what can you infer about the home’s electrical
system?

**A:** The home’s electrical system must have step-down transformers
that lower the voltage for some of the home’s circuits.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._91-tt2}

-   The electrical grid is the entire electrical system that generates,
    transmits, and distributes electric power throughout a region
    or country. It includes power plants, transmission lines, and
    electric substations.
-   Power plants are where electric power originates. They have electric
    generators that generate electric current through
    electromagnetic induction.
-   Transmission lines carry electric current from power plants to
    substations and from substations to homes and other places where
    electric power is needed.
-   Electric substations have step-up or step-down transformers to
    increase or decrease the voltage of current as needed.
