# Forewor {#1.html#x-ck12-Rm9yZXdvcg..-chapter}

Earth science is the study of planet Earth. The CK-12 Earth Science
Concept Collection For Middle School presents Earth science as a set of
14 chapters, each centered around a general area of study, such as plate
tectonics or atmospheric processes. Each chapter is broken down into
concepts. Each concept is a mini-lesson that addresses one specific
topic or key objective. The complete CK-12 Earth Science Concept
Collection For Middle School is comprised of 308 concepts.

**How is science different from other ways of understanding the world?**

If someone asks you, “What is science?” you might say that it’s a bunch
of facts and explanations. But that’s only part of the story. Science is
a knowledge base. But science is also a way of learning about the world.
Earth science is about our planet and its environments. Earth scientists
study Earth’s surface and interior. They study why volcanoes erupt and
why some places are mountainous and some are entirely flat. Some Earth
scientists are interested in the weather. Others want to know about the
oceans. There are even Earth scientists who apply what they know about
Earth to learning about space. Some Earth scientists do a lot of their
work in the field, as seen above.

**What is a fact?**

Science is different from other ways of thinking. It is based on facts.
Gravity is a fact. If you let go of a ball, it will fall to the ground.
Can you tell a fact from an opinion? Can you tell when an idea follows
logically from a fact? Basing ideas on facts is essential to good
science.

### Facts, Observations, Opinions {#2.html#x-ck12-RmFjdHMsIE9ic2VydmF0aW9ucywgT3BpbmlvbnM.-byx}

**Science** is a set of facts, and it is also a set of explanations that
are based on those facts. Science relies on facts to explain the natural
world.

Scientists usually begin an investigation with facts. A **fact** is a
bit of information that is true. Facts come from data collected from
observations. Facts can also come from experiments that have been run.
**Data** is factual information that results from an investigation.
Facts and data are not subject to opinion or bias. An opinion is
someone's subjective view or position on a subject.

What is a fact? Look at the following list. Identify if the statement is
(1) a fact (from observation or prior experiments), (2) an opinion, or
(3) a combination.

**Figure 2.1**

Can you be sure from the photo that Susan has a cold?

</div>

1.  Susan ( **Figure**
    [above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1HaXJsU25lZXppbmc.) ) has black hair.
2.  Susan is sneezing. She has a cold.
3.  Colds are caused by viruses.
4.  Echinacea is an herb that prevents colds.
5.  Bill Gates is the smartest man in the United States.
6.  People born under the astrological sign Leo are fiery, self-assured,
    and charming.
7.  Average global temperature has risen since 1900.

### An Analysis {#2.html#x-ck12-QW4gQW5hbHlzaXM.-fm2}

The following is an analysis of the statements above:

1.  This is a fact. The fact comes from observation.
2.  The first sentence is a fact from observation. The woman
    is sneezing. The second sentence is an opinion. She might have a
    cold, or she might have allergies or the flu. Tests could be done to
    see what is causing her illness. This opinion could become fact if
    the tests show that she actually has a cold, or it could be
    proven wrong.
3.  This is a fact. Many, many scientific experiments have shown that
    colds are caused by viruses.
4.  This statement sounds like a fact. However, the scientific evidence
    is mixed. One reputable study published in 2007 showed a decrease in
    colds of 58% in people who used echinacea. Several other studies
    have shown no beneficial effect.
5.  Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the United States; that’s
    a fact. However, there’s no evidence that he’s also the smartest
    man; this is an opinion.
6.  This sounds like a fact, but it is not. There must be data to
    support the statement. How would you test it? Gather together a
    large number of subjects, each with a friend. Have the friends fill
    out a questionnaire describing the subject. Match the traits against
    the person’s astrological sign. Do the astrological predictions fit?
    Are Leos actually more fiery, self-assured, and charming? Tests like
    this have not supported the claims of astrologers. However,
    astrologers have not modified their opinions.
7.  This is a fact. The following graph shows the temperature anomaly
    since 1880 ( **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMtMDEtMDEtVGVtcGVyYXR1cmVBbm9tYWx5) ).
    There’s no doubt that average global temperature has risen
    since 1880. The largest rise has been since the late 1970s.

**How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?**

This is a question that has been pondered over the centuries. Can it be
answered using the scientific method? Is it a scientific question?

### The Goal of Science {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdvYWwgb2YgU2NpZW5jZQ.._1-gcw}

The goal of science is to answer questions about the natural world.
Asking (and answering) questions is integral to the process of science.
Scientific questions must be testable. Which of these two questions is a
good scientific question and which is not?

-   What is the age of our planet Earth?
-   How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

The first is a good scientific question. It can be answered by
age-dating rocks and by using other techniques. The second question
cannot be answered using data. It is not a scientific question.

### Scientific Method {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW50aWZpYyBNZXRob2Q._1-wgc}

Scientists use the **scientific method** to answer questions. The
scientific method is a series of steps. These steps help scientists (or
even just people!) investigate a question.

Often, students learn that the scientific method goes from step to step
to step in a specific order, like so:

-   Ask a question. The question can be based on one or more
    observations or on data from a previous experiment.
-   Do some background research.
-   Create a hypothesis. Use your imagination and reasoning skills.
-   Conduct experiments or make observations to test the hypothesis.
-   Gather the data.
-   Use logical reasoning to formulate a conclusion.

In reality, however, the process doesn’t always go in a straight line. A
scientist might ask a question and then start doing some background
research. During his research, he may discover that his original
question needed to be asked in a different way, or that an entirely
different question should be asked. As a result, he is brought back to
the first step of the scientific method.

A flow chart of how science works can be found here:
[http://undsci.berkeley.edu/lessons/pdfs/complex\_flow\_handout.pdf](complex_flow_handout.pdf)
.

### Ask a Question {#2.html#x-ck12-QXNrIGEgUXVlc3Rpb24._1-zif}

Now, let’s ask a scientific question. Remember that it must be testable.

We learned in the previous concept, "Scientific Explanations and
Interpretations," that the average global temperature has been on the
rise. Scientists know that carbon dioxide is a **greenhouse gas** .
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. This leads us to a
question:

Question: Is the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere
changing?

This is a good scientific question because it is testable.

Observatory](ck12_2_files/20150911025555194960.png "Graph of atmospheric carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa Observatory")

**Figure 2.3**

According to data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii,
atmospheric carbon dioxide has been increasing since record keeping
began in 1958. The small ups and downs of the red line are due to
seasonal changes in the winter and summer. The black line traces the
annual average.

</div>

How has carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changed since 1958 ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1LZWVsaW5nQ3VydmU.) )? The line on the
graph is going up so carbon dioxide has increased. About how much has it
increased in parts per million?

### Answer a Question {#2.html#x-ck12-QW5zd2VyIGEgUXVlc3Rpb24._1-3vc}

So we’ve answered the question. We used data from research that has
already been done. Fortunately, scientists have been monitoring CO ~2~
levels over the years. If they hadn't, we’d have to start these
measurements now.

Because this question can be answered with data, it is testable.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-red}

**What is a hypothesis?**

An educated guess? Is that what you learned a hypothesis is? Lots of
people have learned that, but it’s not exactly right. So what is a
hypothesis? There are two hypotheses listed below. They address a
question about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Check out what those
hypotheses are. Then we'll see what to do with them next.

### Asking a New Question {#2.html#x-ck12-QXNraW5nIGEgTmV3IFF1ZXN0aW9u_2-ekd}

First, we need to find a question that we want to answer. Let's start
with the fact that atmospheric CO ~2~ has been increasing since 1958.
This leads us to ask the following: why is atmospheric CO ~2~
increasing?

### Possible Answers to the Question {#2.html#x-ck12-UG9zc2libGUgQW5zd2VycyB0byB0aGUgUXVlc3Rpb24._2-goj}

A **hypothesis** is a reasonable explanation for a small range of
phenomena. A hypothesis is limited in scope; it attempts to explain a
single event or a fact. A hypothesis must be **testable** and
**falsifiable** . In other words, we must be able to test it, and we
must be able to disprove it.

Back to answering the question. Let's say we do some background research
to learn the possible sources of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We
discover that there are at least two (there are actually many more):

-   CO ~2~ is released into the atmosphere by volcanoes when they erupt.
-   CO ~2~ is released when fossil fuels are burned.

From these two facts, we can create two hypotheses; we will have
**multiple working hypotheses** . We can test each of these hypotheses.
We can prove either or both of these hypotheses false. In this case,
it's even possible that both are true.

#### Hypothesis 1 {#2.html#x-ck12-SHlwb3RoZXNpcyAx_2-mit}

Atmospheric CO ~2~ has increased over the past five decades because the
amount of CO ~2~ gas released by volcanoes has increased.

#### Hypothesis 2 {#2.html#x-ck12-SHlwb3RoZXNpcyAy_2-3vb}

The increase in atmospheric CO ~2~ is due to the increase in the amount
of fossil fuels that are being burned.

Usually, testing a hypothesis requires making observations or performing
experiments. In this case, we will look into existing scientific
literature to see if either of these hypotheses can be disproved, or if
one or both can be supported by the data.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-qe0}

-   A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for a small range
    of phenomena.
-   A scientific hypothesis must be both testable and falsifiable.
-   If two or more hypotheses are being tested, they are called multiple
    working hypotheses.

**How can I show that my hypothesis is wrong?**

Many young scientists learn that a good scientist tries to disprove her
hypothesis. This is the best way to be sure that your hypothesis is
getting a rigorous test. Why do you think established scientists tell
students this? Why is it a good idea?

### Testing Hypotheses {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVzdGluZyBIeXBvdGhlc2Vz_3-wjm}

How do you test a hypothesis? Often you need scientific tools, perhaps a
microscope or a magnetometer. You need to know how to analyze the data
that comes from those tools. Often computers are needed to gather,
analyze, and interpret the data.

In this example, we will look into the scientific literature to find
data. These studies were done using scientific method. The scientists
used the necessary tools and computers. To test a new hypothesis, we
would need to do the experiments ourselves.

We will test the two hypothesis that we developed to explain this fact:
Atmospheric CO ~2~ has increased over the past five decades.

#### Testing Hypothesis 1 {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVzdGluZyBIeXBvdGhlc2lzIDE._3-b9q}

Hypothesis 1: Atmospheric CO ~2~ has increased over the past five
decades because the amount of CO ~2~ gas released by volcanoes has
increased.

To test Hypothesis 1, we need to see if the amount of CO ~2~ gas
released by volcanoes over the past several decades has increased.

There are two ways volcanoes could account for the increase in CO ~2~ :

-   There has been an increase in volcanic eruptions in that time.
-   The CO ~2~ content of volcanic gases has increased over
    time globally.

To test the first possibility, we can look at scientific literature from
a site like
[http://www.volcano.si.edu/education/questions/index.cfm?faq=06.](index.cfm?faq=06.)
Our research tells us that 50-70 eruptions occur every year. We see that
the number of volcanic eruptions is about constant. We learn from
different scientific papers that volcanic gas compositions have not
changed over time. Different types of volcanoes have different gas
compositions. However, the overall the gases are the same. Another
scientific paper states that major volcanic eruptions for the past 30
years have caused short-term cooling, not warming!

Hypothesis 1 is wrong! Volcanic activity is not able to account for the
rise in atmospheric CO ~2~ . Remember that science is falsifiable. We
can discard Hypothesis 1.

When a hypothesis is wrong, often much has been learned anyway. Rarely
is the pursuit of a hypothesis a total loss!

#### Testing Hypothesis 2 {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVzdGluZyBIeXBvdGhlc2lzIDI._3-usw}

Hypothesis 2: The increase in atmospheric CO ~2~ is due to the increase
in the amount of fossil fuels that are being burned.

To test hypothesis 2, we need to see if the amount of CO ~2~ gas
released by fossil fuels over the past several decades has increased. We
look into the scientific literature and find the following graph (
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1DTzJFbWlzc2lvbnNGcm9tRm9zc2lsRnVlbHMy) ).

</div>

Fossil fuels have added an increasing amount of carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid
19th century. Hypothesis 2 appears to be at least partly true!

It is very important when testing hypotheses to eliminate any bias. A
biased researcher may miss important factors that do not match his bias.
It actually is good to try to disprove your own hypothesis! Having other
researchers involved will also help to eliminate bias.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-9pv}

-   Science is falsifiable. An incorrect hypothesis is discarded.
-   Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing. Fossil fuel
    burning is increasing. The rise in fossil fuel burning is increasing
    the CO ~2~ in the atmosphere.
-   More than one hypothesis can be tested at a time. This is called
    multiple working hypotheses.

**Sugar consumption is up. Global temperatures are up. Is one causing
the other?**

Is the rise in sugar consumption in America causing the average global
temperature to rise? Are rising temperatures causing people to eat more
sugar? Both of these factors are rising, but how are they related? Are
they related by correlation, causation, or both?

### Correlation {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29ycmVsYXRpb24._4-c2e}

We made a few discoveries so far in this concept:

-   Average global temperature has been rising for the past
    several decades.
-   Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been rising for the past
    several decades.
-   Carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from fossil fuel
    burning have been rising for the past several decades.

A **correlation** is the mutual relationship between two or more things.
We see here a correlation between three things: (1) CO ~2~ emissions
from fossil fuel burning are rising (2) atmospheric CO ~2~ levels are
rising, and (3) average global temperatures are rising. These three
things exhibit **positive correlation** . They are all going in the same
direction. If one factor rises while another sinks they have **negative
correlation** . For example, the amount of forest land is decreasing.
This factor has a negative correlation with global temperature.

### Causation {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2F0aW9u_4-fpn}

But correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. **Causation**
refers to the factor that is producing the effect. If I push a toy car,
I will cause it to move. To explain the difference between correlation
and causation, let’s look at an example. Sugar consumption in the United
States has been rising for decades ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1TdWdhckNvbnN1bXB0aW9u) ). There is a
positive correlation between sugar consumption and rising average global
temperatures.

**Figure 2.5**

</div>

Is the rise in sugar consumption causing the rise in global
temperatures? Is the rise in global temperatures causing the rise in
sugar consumption? These two things aren't impossible, but they are
extremely unlikely. There’s no **mechanism** for one to increase the
other. Here there is correlation, not causation. To establish causation
we need to know how one would cause the other.

#### Fossil Fuel Burning Causes Temperatures to Rise {#2.html#x-ck12-Rm9zc2lsIEZ1ZWwgQnVybmluZyBDYXVzZXMgVGVtcGVyYXR1cmVzIHRvIFJpc2U._4-ni0}

Here is a brief outline of the way an increase in CO ~2~ can increase
global temperatures. This is a logical step-by-step argument. There is
no part of this explanation that goes beyond the evidence.

-   Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat. CO ~2~ is a
    greenhouse gas.
-   Burning fossil fuels releases CO ~2~ into the atmosphere.
-   The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more heat
    can be trapped.
-   The more heat that’s trapped, the warmer average global
    temperatures are.

Because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, increased CO ~2~ in the
atmosphere causes average global temperatures to rise. We found one
cause for rising global temperatures. There are also others. Climate
change science is dealt with extensively in the chapters *Atmospheric
Processes* and *Weather and Climate* .

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-e9r}

-   Correlation is a comparison of two factors within a population.
    Correlation does not imply causation.
-   If one factor is responsible for the change in another factor, there
    is causation.
-   Establishing causation requires a mechanism to show how one factor
    can influence the other.
-   Burning fossil fuels releases CO ~2~ into the atmosphere. That CO
    ~2~ traps heat, which causes global temperatures to rise.

**How do you test a hypothesis?**

When you test a hypothesis, you must make observations or perform
experiments. So far in this concept we have used scientific papers that
were published. The papers were available because scientists collected
that data using scientific method. If we asked a new question, we would
need to do the testing ourselves. How might you do the testing yourself?

### Testing Hypotheses {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVzdGluZyBIeXBvdGhlc2Vz_5-1kh}

To test a hypothesis you need data. How do you collect data? By making
observations or running experiments.

#### Observations {#2.html#x-ck12-T2JzZXJ2YXRpb25z_5-tkl}

Observations can happen on many scales. You can use a microscope to
observe tiny things. You can use a telescope to observe distant things
in space. To learn about the effects of climate change, you could
observe Earth's surface. How would you make observations of Earth's
surface? You could do this from the land surface or from space. Many
important observations are made by orbiting satellites. These satellites
have a bird's eye view of how the planet is changing ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1KYWtvYnNoYXZuSXNicmFlR2xhY2llclJldHJlYXQ.)

Observations are made when it is not possible to do experiments.
Scientists send devices to make observations in dangerous places. They
send devices to places that are difficult for people to go. For example,
many rovers have been to Mars ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DdXJpb3NpdHlSb3Zlcg..) ). There will
probably be many more before the first human gets there.

#### Experiments {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhwZXJpbWVudHM._5-ivk}

Answering some questions requires **experiments** . An experiment is a
test that may be performed in the field or in a laboratory. An
experiment must always be done under controlled conditions. The goal of
an experiment is to test a hypothesis. The data from the experiment will
verify or falsify the hypothesis.

##### Variables {#2.html#x-ck12-VmFyaWFibGVz_5-zpg}

In an experiment, it is important to change only one factor. All other
factors must be kept the same.

-   **independent variable** : The factor that will be changed.
-   **dependent variable** : The factors that depend on the
    independent variable.

An experiment must have a **control group** . In the control group,
nothing is changed. It is not subjected to the independent variable. For
example, say you want to test if Vitamin C prevents colds. You gather a
large number of people to be your sample group. Then you divide your
sample group up. Some receive Vitamin C and some do not. Those who do
not receive the Vitamin C are the control group. Vitamin C is the
independent variable.

Why should an experiment manipulate only one variable? Imagine a woman
who eats a diet heavy on junk food. She is low on energy and says she
just doesn't feel right. She decides to change her diet. She cuts out
dairy products, wheat, meat and refined sugar. She also cuts out junk
food. She feels better! She insists that the cause of her new well-being
is the lack of dairy, wheat, meat, and sugar. But it's also possible
that she feels better because she eliminated junk food. In other words,
she doesn't know what made her feel better. Is it possible that it was
eliminating junk food that made her feel better? Is it possible it was
eliminating wheat? Meat? Maybe she's lactose intolerant and it was milk.
Of course, it could have been any of those things. She doesn't know what
it is that made her feel better because she changed too many variables.
How could she be more scientific about understanding exactly what it was
in her diet that was making her feel bad?

#### Experimental Error {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhwZXJpbWVudGFsIEVycm9y_5-flv}

Scientists make many measurements during experiments. Humans and
equipment can make mistakes. Errors are often unavoidable. This is
called **experimental error** . Errors may be due to the equipment being
used. In this case, the numbers may be always skewed in one direction.
For example, a scale may always measure one-half of an ounce high.
People can also make errors. A measurement may not be made precisely.
For example, a stopwatch may be stopped too soon or too late. But
probably not always in the same direction. To correct for this, many
measurements are taken. The measurements are then averaged. Experiments
always have a margin of error associated with them.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-vgy}

-   Testing a hypothesis requires data. Data can be gathered by
    observations or by experiments.
-   Observations can be done simply by looking at and measuring
    a phenomenon. Observations can also be done by using
    advanced technology.
-   Experiments must be well-designed. They must be done under
    controlled conditions. Only one variable should be manipulated.
-   Errors are always possible in human endeavors. Scientists have ways
    to reduce the effects of errors on their data.

**Do you have a theory about why this batter can't hit?**

This batter hasn't hit a ball in his last 20 at bats. His coach has a
theory: it's because he needs glasses. The idea is a good one, although
it is not a theory. In common speech, the word theory is often misused.
It is often misused when referring to scientific ideas as well. What
would be a better word to use?

### Theory {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlb3J5_6-mbw}

Scientists collect evidence to test a hypothesis. The evidence may
refute the hypothesis. In that case, it will be thrown out. The evidence
may support the hypothesis. The scientists will then gather more
evidence. The scientists will accept the hypothesis if: (1) There is no
significant evidence to refute the hypothesis. (2) There is an enormous
amount of evidence to support the hypothesis. The hypothesis may then
become a theory.

A scientific **theory** is supported by many types of evidence. It is a
synthesis of evidence from many experiments and observations. A theory
has no major inconsistencies. A theory is a simple model of reality. It
is simpler than the phenomenon itself. A theory explains a phenomenon.
Scientists can use a theory to make predictions.

A theory is constantly tested. If some data does not agree with the
theory, the theory can be revised. If the theory cannot match the data,
it is thrown out. That being said, sometimes a theory is
well-established; it has a lot of evidence to back it up. A
well-established theory is unlikely to be overthrown. It may just need
to be modified a bit. But science does not prove anything beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

theory:

#### Three Essential Theories {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhyZWUgRXNzZW50aWFsIFRoZW9yaWVz_6-2us}

The three theories below are essential in Earth science. Each accounts
for an enormous amount of data. Each is supported by many lines of
evidence. All can be used to make predications. As new evidence arises,
any of these theories may need to be altered. But none of these three
are likely ever to be disproved. They are accepted by nearly all of the
credible scientists in their fields.

#### The Theory of Evolution {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRoZW9yeSBvZiBFdm9sdXRpb24._6-5ua}

Evolution means change over time. Darwin’s theory of **evolution** says
that organisms change over time ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1IdW1hbkV2b2x1dGlvbg..) ). Evolution is
seen in the fossil record. It is seen in the way organisms develop.
Evolution is evident in the geographic locations where organism are
found. It is evident in the genes of living organisms. Evolution has a
mechanism called **natural selection** . The organism that is best
suited to its environment is most likely to survive. Evolution is
described in the chapter *Life on Earth* .

#### The Theory of Plate Tectonics {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRoZW9yeSBvZiBQbGF0ZSBUZWN0b25pY3M._6-gza}

Plate tectonics theory says that slabs of continents move around on
Earth's surface. The mechanism for that movement is seafloor spreading.
Plate tectonics explain many things about Earth: (1) geological
activity, why it happens where it does; (2) natural resources, why many
are found where they are; and (3) the past and future, what happened in
the past and what will happen in the future. The theory of plate
tectonics will be explored in the chapter *Plate Tectonics* .

#### The Theory of Climate Change {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRoZW9yeSBvZiBDbGltYXRlIENoYW5nZQ.._6-gom}

The theory of climate change is very new. In fact, scientists don't even
call it a theory. But it meets the requirements. These are the things we
know: (1) average global temperatures are rising, (2) greenhouse gases
trap heat in the atmosphere, (3) CO ~2~ is released into the atmosphere
when fossil fuels are burned, (4) CO ~2~ is a greenhouse gas, (5) more
CO ~2~ in the atmosphere traps more heat so global temperature is
rising. No information contradicts this theory, although some details
have not been worked out. The theory is very effective at predicting
future events, which are already taking place. This idea will be
explored in detail in the chapter *Atmospheric Processes* .

#### Laws {#2.html#x-ck12-TGF3cw.._6-kre}

Many people think that any idea that is completely accepted in science
is a law. But that is not true. In science, a **law** is something that
always applies under the same conditions. A law explains a fairly simple
phenomenon. A theory is much more complex: it tells you why something
happens. A law only tells you that it happens. For example, if you hold
something above the ground and let go, it will fall. This phenomenon is
recognized by the law of gravity ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ta3lkaXZpbmc.) ). Some people say that
evolution is "just a theory." But for a complex explanation like
evolution, theory is the right word.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-z63}

-   A theory is an explanation of a complex phenomenon. A theory tells
    why something happens.

-   A law describes something that always happens under the same set
    of circumstances. A law does not say why it happens. But even laws

**Why do scientists need models?**

Scientists work with models because reality is complex and difficult.
Earth's climate is an example of a system that is both difficult and
complex. Many factors influence climate: clouds, snow cover, ocean
mixing, sequestration of carbon in the oceans, etc. In fact, there are
many more factors than can be dealt with all at once. Models are
necessary in science. However, you must always remember that a model is
a model and not the real thing.

### Models are Useful Tools {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9kZWxzIGFyZSBVc2VmdWwgVG9vbHM._7-p26}

**Scientific models** are useful tools for scientists. Most of Earth's
systems are extremely complex. Models allow scientists to work with
systems that are nearly impossible to study as a whole. Models help
scientists to understand these systems. They can analyze and make
predictions about them using the models. There are different types of
models.

-   Physical models are smaller and simpler representations of the thing
    being studied. A globe or a map is a physical model of a portion or
    all of Earth.
-   Conceptual models tie together many ideas to explain a phenomenon
    or event.
-   Mathematical models are sets of equations that take into account
    many factors to represent a phenomenon. Mathematical models are
    usually done on computers.

Many models are created on computers ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db21wdXRlck1vZGVsbGluZw..) ). Only
computers can handle and manipulate such enormous amounts of data. Many
scientists now work with climate models. An unimaginable number of
factors affect Earth’s climate. Many factors are dependent on one
another. A reasonably accurate climate model needs the most powerful
computers. Still, no computer has yet been developed that can work with
the entire system. So scientists create models that represent parts of
the system.

#### Models Can be Used to Test Ideas {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9kZWxzIENhbiBiZSBVc2VkIHRvIFRlc3QgSWRlYXM._7-w2f}

Scientists must test their ideas. It's much easier to work with a model
than with a whole system. A scientist may want to understand how rising
CO ~2~ levels will affect climate. In this case, it will be easier to
model a smaller portion of that system. For example, the scientist may
model how higher levels of CO ~2~ affect plant growth and the effect
that will have on climate.

#### Models Can be Used to Make Predictions {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9kZWxzIENhbiBiZSBVc2VkIHRvIE1ha2UgUHJlZGljdGlvbnM._7-9vr}

Models can be used to predict the future. The best ones take into
account the most factors. How do scientists know if a model will predict
the future accurately? One way is to use a time in the past as the
starting point. Then run the model to see if the model can accurately
predict the present. A model that can successfully predict the present
is more likely to be better at predicting the future. For example,
climate models are very useful for trying to determine what types of
changes we can expect as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rises.

#### Models Have Limitations {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9kZWxzIEhhdmUgTGltaXRhdGlvbnM._7-cmx}

Since models are simpler than real objects or systems, they have
limitations. A model deals with only a portion of a system. It may not
predict the behavior of the real system very accurately. But the more
computing power that goes into the model and the care with which the
scientists construct the model can increase the chances that a model
will be accurate.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-9lv}

-   A model is a representation of a more complex system. Models can be
    manipulated more easily than the system.
-   Models can be used to make predictions.
-   Models may be physical, conceptual, or mathematical.

**Can only a genius be a scientist?**

Of course not! Scientists come from all backgrounds. They have many
interests and talents. Scientists have many different reasons for
pursuing science. Most scientists are intelligent, creative and logical
people. They are open to new ideas but require evidence to accept them.
Women and racial minorities are becoming scientists more than ever
before. Diversity brings in more ideas and more ways of solving
problems. This makes science stronger.

### Funding Science {#2.html#x-ck12-RnVuZGluZyBTY2llbmNl_8-ywm}

Scientific research is expensive. So the scientific community controls
the type of research that is done. They do this by allotting money.
Scientists must write a proposal to an agency or private organization.
Two examples are the National Science Foundation and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The scientists outline
their project and list what they need in equipment, supplies, and
salaries. Scientific proposals are evaluated by other scientists in that
field of science. In many fields, the funding rate is low. The money
goes only to the most worthy research projects. Once the scientists get
the money, they can do their research.

### Working Environment {#2.html#x-ck12-V29ya2luZyBFbnZpcm9ubWVudA.._8-bmr}

Scientists may work in colleges and universities. They may work in
research institutions or government agencies. Businesses and industries
hire scientists in a variety of fields. There are many opportunities for
well-trained scientists.

Scientists may work together on a project. One reason is that they can
share equipment and personnel. Another reason is that they can share
ideas. Scientists may also work separately. Even then, they use each
other's data and interpretations. When one scientist publishes a paper,
others will replicate the work to make sure they get the same result. If
they do, the work is valid. If they don't, someone needs to find the
source of the problem. Scientists openly communicate with each other on
their results. They also discuss and sometimes disagree on their
interpretations. If scientists do disagree, they will look for evidence
so that they may resolve the disagreement.

### Sharing Results {#2.html#x-ck12-U2hhcmluZyBSZXN1bHRz_8-71q}

A hypothesis will not be fully accepted unless it is supported by the
work of many scientists. Although a study may take place in a single
laboratory, a scientist must present her work to the community of
scientists in her field.

**Figure 2.11**

Participants share their results at a scientific conference.

</div>

The scientist may present her data and conclusions at a scientific
conference ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BR1VDb25mZXJlbmNl) ). She will talk
with many other scientists to see what they think of her work.
Scientists will openly discuss and criticize the work. The scientist may
need to gather more data to resolve the problems. Later, she will write
a paper to be published in a scientific journal. Several scientists will
review the paper. This process is called **peer review** . They will
make sure the researcher used scientific method. They will make sure her
interpretations follow logically from the data. The scientists may then
recommend that she does further work. Or they may deny the paper for
publication. Once the paper is published, other scientists will use her
results in their own work.

Scientific ideas are advanced after many papers on a topic are
published.

### The Outcomes of a Scientific Study {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE91dGNvbWVzIG9mIGEgU2NpZW50aWZpYyBTdHVkeQ.._8-j4h}

Sometimes a study will support an idea. This may bring the idea closer
to acceptance in the scientific community. Sometimes new methods or
procedures may be developed for a study to be performed. This may assist
other scientists with their investigations. Any of these things may lead
to new investigations and new data.

### Scientific Integrity {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW50aWZpYyBJbnRlZ3JpdHk._8-gq8}

The scientific community monitors scientific integrity. During their
training, students learn how to conduct good scientific experiments.
They learn not to fake, hide, or selectively report data. They learn how
to fairly evaluate data. They learn how to interpret the work of other
scientists. Scientists who do not have scientific integrity are strongly
condemned by the scientific community. Sometimes scientists are hired by
private companies to do studies. Often these scientists find what the
company wants them to find. These studies should be evaluated very
carefully before the results are used. However, often the studies are
taken seriously by the media. It is important to know who funded the
research to know how to evaluate the results of a study.

Nothing is perfect, and science isn't either. Still, considering all the
scientific research that is done, there are few incidences of scientific
dishonesty. When they do occur, they are often reported with great
vehemence by the media. This may cause the public to mistrust scientists
in ways that are unwarranted.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-aey}

-   If science is done well, other scientists who replicate the same
    work will get the same results.
-   Scientists peer review a scientific paper before it is published.
    This is done to be sure the work was done using the
    scientific method.
-   There are lots of controls in science. Scientists communicate and
    replicate each other's work. The scientific community has control of
    the projects that get funded.
-   The checks and balances assure that nearly all scientists operate
    with a great deal of integrity.

**What is Earth science?**

Earth scientists seek to understand the beautiful sphere on which we
live. Earth is a very large, complex set of systems. So most Earth
scientists study one aspect of the planet. Researchers work together to
answer complicated questions. The major branches of Earth science are
described below.

### Geology {#2.html#x-ck12-R2VvbG9neQ.._9-wko}

**Geology** is the study of the solid Earth. Geologists study how rocks
and minerals form. The way mountains rise up is part of geology. The way
mountains erode away is another part. Geologists also study fossils and
Earth’s history. There are many other branches of geology. There is so
much to know about our home planet that most geologists become
specialists in one area. For example, a mineralogist studies minerals (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XaGF0SXNHZW9sb2d5) ).

**Figure 2.12**

(left) Mineralogists focus on all kinds of minerals. (right)
Seismographs are used to measure earthquakes and pinpoint their origins.

</div>

Some volcanologists brave molten lava to study volcanoes. Seismologists
monitor earthquakes worldwide to help protect people and property from
harm ( **Figure** [above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XaGF0SXNHZW9sb2d5)
). Paleontologists are interested in fossils and how ancient organisms
lived. Scientists who compare the geology of other planets to Earth are
planetary geologists. Some geologists study the Moon. Others look for
petroleum. Still others specialize in studying soil. Some geologists can
tell how old rocks are and determine how different rock layers formed.
There is probably an expert in almost anything you can think of related
to Earth!

Geologists might study rivers and lakes, the underground water found
between soil and rock particles, or even water that is frozen in
glaciers. Earth scientists need geographers who explore the features of
Earth’s surface. They work with cartographers, who make maps. Studying
the layers of rock beneath the surface helps us to understand the
history of planet Earth ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTAxMDItMTA.) ).

Geologists ask a lot of questions. They wonder what they need to know
about earthquakes to be able to predict them in time to evacuate a
region. They ask what will happen to shorelines as sea level rises. Some
even wonder what would happen if the magnetic field reverses!

### Oceanography {#2.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5vZ3JhcGh5_9-tuo}

**Oceanography** is the study of the oceans. The word oceanology might
be more accurate, since “ology” is “the study of.” “Graph” is “to write”
and refers to mapmaking. But mapping the oceans is how oceanography
started.

More than 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water. Almost all of
that water is in the oceans. Scientists have visited the deepest parts
of the ocean in submarines. Remote vehicles go where humans can't (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BTFZJTlN1Ym1lcnNpYmxl) ).
Yet much of the ocean remains unexplored. Some people call the ocean
“the last frontier.”

**Figure 2.14**

</div>

There are many branches of oceanography. Physical oceanography is the
study of water movement, like waves and ocean currents. Physical
oceanographers ask when or if a tsunami will hit a shoreline. Marine
geologists look at rocks and structures in the ocean basins. These
scientists ask how new ocean crust forms. Chemical oceanographers study
the natural elements in ocean water. Chemical oceanographers might be
concerned with where carbon dioxide goes in the oceans. Marine
biologists look at marine life. There are lots of questions to ask about
marine life!

### Meteorology and Climatology {#2.html#x-ck12-TWV0ZW9yb2xvZ3kgYW5kIENsaW1hdG9sb2d5_9-szp}

Meteorologists don’t study meteors—they study the atmosphere! The
atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds Earth. The word
“meteor” refers to things in the air. **Meteorology** includes the study
of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Meteorology is
very important. Using radars and satellites, meteorologists work to
predict, or forecast, the weather ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ucm9waWNhbFN0b3JtSXNhYWNGb3JlY2FzdA..)
). Meteorologists are getting better at predicting the weather all the
time. Meteorologists wonder how to better predict weather. They wonder
what the effects of rising water vapor in the atmosphere will be on
weather.

**Figure 2.15**

Meteorologists forecast the weather a region can expect from a tropical
storm.

</div>

Climatologists also study the atmosphere. These scientists work to
understand the climate as it is now. They also study how climate will
change in response to global warming. There are lots of questions to ask
about our changing climate.

### Environmental Science {#2.html#x-ck12-RW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbCBTY2llbmNl_9-hwx}

Environmental scientists study the effects people have on their
environment. This includes the landscape, atmosphere, water, and living
things. These scientists ask all sorts of questions about how Earth
systems are changing as a result of human actions. They try to predict
what changes will come in the future.

Ecologists study lifeforms and the environments they live in (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db3JhbFJlZWYy) ). They try
to predict the chain reactions that could occur when one part of the
ecosystem is disrupted.

### Astronomy {#2.html#x-ck12-QXN0cm9ub215_9-s1y}

**Astronomy** is the study of outer space and the physical bodies beyond
planet Earth. Astronomers use telescopes to see things far beyond what
the human eye can see. Astronomers help to design spacecrafts or
satellites that travel into space and send back information about
faraway places ( **Figure**

Astronomers ask a wide variety of questions. How do strong bursts of
energy from the Sun, called solar flares, affect communications? How
might an impact from an asteroid affect life on Earth? What are the
properties of black holes? Astronomers ask bigger questions too. How was
the Universe created? Is there life on other planets? Are there
resources on other planets that people could use for space travel?
Astronomers use what Earth scientists know about our planet to make
comparisons with other planets.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-w8x}

-   The study of Earth science includes many different fields, including
    geology, meteorology, oceanography, and astronomy.

**Do Earth scientists work in the field?**

Yes! Many geologists do field work to better understand Earth. Many
others go on field trips to learn about certain types of geology. In
Glacier National Park, a geologist could learn about mountain building.
They could learn about how glaciers modify landscapes. He could take
photos to assist him in teaching a class. He could just have a great
time in a geologically fascinating area!

### Field Work {#2.html#x-ck12-RmllbGQgV29yaw.._10-zjl}

Many Earth scientists collect data in the field, called **field work** .
The data may be from observations or measurements. The scientists may
create a geological map of the area. They might write detailed
descriptions of the rocks and their relationships. They may collect
samples to analyze in the lab. They may do a combination of all of
these! Earth science laboratories contain high-tech equipment. That
equipment can reveal the chemistry or age of a rock sample. Geologists
do field work to look for resources. They may study a region for
environmental cleanup. There are many other reasons for going in the
field. One common reason is just to understand the region better.

### Field Trips {#2.html#x-ck12-RmllbGQgVHJpcHM._10-cdn}

To really understand geology and some of the other branches of Earth
science, it's best to go out in the field! Geology students in many
colleges and universities go on a lot of **field trips** . Some of the
concepts presented in this text can be illustrated by features seen in
the field. Where possible, photos are provided to illustrate concepts.
So we can get some of the benefit of going on a field trip! Some of the
places that are featured in this text are described below.

#### California {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FsaWZvcm5pYQ.._10-at6}

![Map of major geographic features of
California](ck12_2_files/20150911025558656680.jpeg "Map of major geographic features of California")

**Figure 2.18**

California has a lot of different environments and a complex geologic
history. California is a great place to study geology!

</div>

In the satellite image above ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1DYWxpZm9ybmlhQXJpem9uYQ..) ), it is
possible to identify the major geographic (physical) features of
California.

-   The Coast Range runs the length of the state along the
    Pacific coast. A tremendous amount of rain falls in the northern
    part of the range, so the region is heavily forested. There is less
    rainfall and vegetation further south.
-   The Central Valley is made up of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
    river valleys. The Central Valley runs through about half of the
    central part of the state. The valley is located between the
    mountains of the Coast Range and the Sierra Nevada. The Central
    Valley is one of the most important agricultural regions in
    the world.
-   The Sierra Nevada Mountain range lies east of the Central Valley. In
    the winter, the mountains are covered by snow. In this image, there
    is little to no snow, and the bare rocks of the high peaks
    are showing. Yosemite National Park lies within the Sierra Nevada.
-   East of the Sierra Nevada and into the state of Nevada, the climate
    is very arid. Death Valley, the driest spot in the United States, is
    found there.
-   Mt. Shasta, at the north end of the Sierra Nevada, is the
    southernmost remaining volcanic cone in the Cascades Range.

#### Nevada {#2.html#x-ck12-TmV2YWRh_10-uek}

East of the image of California is Nevada. Very different from
California, Nevada is extremely arid. The Basin and Range province
consists of a set of mountains and valleys. You can see the ranges as
dark brown rocky regions and the valleys as lighter brown.

Northwest](ck12_2_files/20150911025558777409.jpeg "Map of major geographic features of the Pacific Northwest")

**Figure 2.19**

North of California along the Pacific Coast is Oregon, Washington, and
then British Columbia in Canada. This region is similar to California in
having a coastal range, a central valley (at least in part of Oregon),
and very arid lands east of the high Cascades mountains.

</div>

The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes that run through Oregon and
Washington, and into British Columbia ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1NT0RJU09yZWdvbg..) ). Some of them are
easily spotted on this image as white spots in the midst of the green
forests of the Cascades Range.

established in 1910 to preserve the wild lands and wildlife. But less
precipitation and higher summer temperatures has decimated most of the
glaciers. Glacier National Park is a fantastic place to see glacial
features, beautiful scenery, and wildlife ( **Figure**

Grand Prismatic Spring is one of the spectacular features of Yellowstone
National Park.

</div>

Yellowstone National Park ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1NaWxlc1llbGxvd3N0b25l) ) is in the
northwestern corner of Wyoming. Yellowstone is best known for its
incredible geysers. The park also has gorgeous mountain scenery and
fantastic wildlife, including herds of bison ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1ZZWxsb3dzdG9uZUJpc29u) ). The best known
feature is Old Faithful. This geyser is not the highest, largest, or
most beautiful, but it is the most reliable.

The Southwest is home to mountains, canyons, valleys, and flat lands.
Many features discussed in the concepts presented in this text can be
seen in the Southwest.

</div>

The Southwestern United States ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1NT0RJU1NvdXRod2VzdA..) ) is a great place
to study geology. The region is so arid that in most locations rocks and
structures are easily seen. In several concepts we will visit parts of
the Southwest to view geology in the field.

From the rim, the Grand Canyon gives a sense of the vastness of geologic
time and the immensity of the planet.

</div>

Geologists say that the Grand Canyon ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1NaWxlc0dyYW5kQ2FueW9u) ) has "layer cake
geology." This is because the rock strata are in layers. They are
extremely easy to see. Sedimentary rocks are like a book that tells the
story of the environment in which they formed. Rock units can be traced
across large expanses. Looking down into the Grand Canyon, you get a
sense of the vastness of space and of time.

</div>

The Hawaiian Islands ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1IYXdhaWlhbklzbGFuZHM.) ) are in the
central Pacific Ocean. The islands are volcanoes that increase in age
from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of
Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older
through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands
through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting
almost continuously since 1983. There are also eruptions at an
underwater volcano called Loihi seamount. Loihi is the youngest volcano.
Hawaii is a fantastic place to see volcanic eruptions and features.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-yp5}

-   Earth scientists learn about many aspects of their disciplines by
    going out into the field.
-   Field trips are an important part of the education of a
    geology student.

**What does this mean: "The present is the key to the past"?**

How can this photo help you to figure out what happened in Earth's
history? You see the molten lava. You see what the rock looks like when
the lava cools. What if you see that type of rock in an outcrop? You can
assume that it formed from molten lava. This is the best tool for
understanding Earth history. Earth scientists use what they know about
Earth in the present to figure out what happened in the past.

### Ask a Question: Earth History {#2.html#x-ck12-QXNrIGEgUXVlc3Rpb246IEVhcnRoIEhpc3Rvcnk._11-cl1}

The outcrop in the **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-c2h1dHRlcnN0b2NrXzYxMzQyMzM5) is at Checkerboard
Mesa in Zion National Park, Utah. It has a very interesting pattern on
it. As a geology student you may ask: how did this rock form?

**Figure 2.28**

Checkerboard Mesa in Zion National Park, Utah.

</div>

If you look carefully at the rock, you will see that it’s made of sand.
This rock formation is called the Navajo sandstone. Does knowing that
the rock is sandstone tell you how it formed? No, although it limits the
possibilities. The next thing to do is to make observations now and
apply them to this rock that formed long ago.

### Uniformitarianism {#2.html#x-ck12-VW5pZm9ybWl0YXJpYW5pc20._11-rv0}

James Hutton came up with this idea in the late 1700s. The present is
the key to the past. He called this the **principle of
uniformitarianism** . It works like this: we understand a geological
process that happens now. We see the outcome of that process, say a
rock. Then we find evidence that same process happened in the past, like
a similar rock. We can assume that the process operated the same way in
the past.

Let’s go back to that outcrop. What would cause sandstone to have layers
that cross each other, a feature called cross-bedding?

### Answer a Question: Earth History {#2.html#x-ck12-QW5zd2VyIGEgUXVlc3Rpb246IEVhcnRoIEhpc3Rvcnk._11-mj5}

In this photo of this sand dune in Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park,
Utah ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMtMDItMDMtTWVzcXVpdGVTYW5kRHVuZXM.) ), we see
that wind can cause cross-bedding in sand. Cross-bedding is due to
changes in wind direction. There are also ripples caused by the wind
waving over the surface of the dune.

</div>

This doesn’t look exactly like the outcrop of Navajo sandstone, but if
you could cut a cross-section into the face of the dune it would look
very similar.

Since we can observe wind forming sand dunes with these patterns now, we
have a good explanation for how the Navajo sandstone formed. The Navajo
sandstone is a rock formed from ancient sand dunes. The rock shows that
the ancient wind direction changed from time to time.

This is just one example of how geologists use observations they make
today to unravel what happened in Earth’s past. Rocks formed from
volcanoes, oceans, rivers, and many other features are deciphered by
looking at the geological work those features do today.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-cxf}

-   You may need to apply what you know about the present to determine
    what happened in the past.
-   The idea that the present is the key to the past was recognized by
    James Hutton in the late 1700s.
-   If you see something forming by a process today and then find the
    end results of that process in the rock record, you can assume that
    the the process operated the same way in the past.

**How could you locate this feature?**

Geologists, hikers, and many other people need to be able to say where
they are. Or where they want to go. They need to be able to mark a
location on a map. The opening photo is of Old Faithful Geyser in
Yellowstone National Park. It is located at 44°30'N and 110°150'W. Let’s
explore what that means.

### Location {#2.html#x-ck12-TG9jYXRpb24._12-lpj}

To describe your location, you could use a coordinate system. To do this
you need two points. For example, you could use streets. Maybe you are
at the corner of Maple Avenue and Main Street. Or you could use a point
of reference, a distance and an angle for direction. If you want to meet
up with a friend, you could tell him “I am two blocks due north of your
apartment.” Can you identify the point of reference, the distance, and
the angle?

#### Map Coordinates {#2.html#x-ck12-TWFwIENvb3JkaW5hdGVz_12-j5j}

Most maps use a grid of lines to help you to find your location. This
grid system is called a geographic **coordinate system** . Using this
system you can define your location by two numbers, latitude and
longitude. Both numbers are angles between your location, the center of
Earth, and a reference line ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjA4) ).

**Figure 2.30**

Lines of latitude start with the Equator. Lines of longitude begin at
the prime meridian.

</div>

#### Latitude {#2.html#x-ck12-TGF0aXR1ZGU._12-siy}

Lines of **latitude** circle around Earth. The **Equator** is a line of
latitude right in the middle of the planet. Latitude is divided into
degrees: 90° north of the Equator and 90° south of the Equator. One
degree is subdivided into 60 minutes. One minute is subdivided into 60
seconds. The Equator is at 0°. The Equator is an equal distance from
both the North and South Poles. If you know your latitude, you know how
far you are north or south of the Equator.

#### Longitude {#2.html#x-ck12-TG9uZ2l0dWRl_12-ghd}

Lines of **longitude** are circles that go around Earth from pole to
pole, like the sections of an orange. Longitude is also measured in
degrees, which are subdivided into minutes and seconds. Lines of
longitude start at the Prime Meridian, which is 0°. The **Prime
Meridian** is a circle that runs north to south and passes through
Greenwich, England. Longitude tells you how far you are east or west
from the Prime Meridian ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjA5) ). On the opposite side of the
planet from the Prime Meridian is the International Date Line. It is at
180°. This is the place where a new day first arrives.

map](ck12_2_files/20150911025600771612.png "Lines of latitude and longitude on a map")

**Figure 2.31**

Lines of latitude and longitude form convenient reference points on a
map.

</div>

You can remember latitude and longitude by doing jumping jacks. When
your hands are above your head and your feet are together, say longitude
(your body is long!). When you put your arms out to the side
horizontally, say latitude (your head and arms make a cross, like the
“t” in latitude). While you are jumping, your arms are going the same
way as each of these grid lines: horizontal for latitude and vertical
for longitude.

#### Using Latitude and Longitude on a Map {#2.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgTGF0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIExvbmdpdHVkZSBvbiBhIE1hcA.._12-fcq}

If you know the latitude and longitude of a place, you can find it on a
map. Simply place one finger on the latitude on the vertical axis of the
map. Place your other finger on the longitude along the horizontal axis
of the map. Move your fingers along the latitude and longitude lines
until they meet. For example, say the location you want to find is at
30°N and 90°W. Place your right finger along 30°N at the right of the
map. Place your left finger along the bottom at 90°W. Move your fingers
along the lines until they meet. Your location should be near New
Orleans, Louisiana, along the Gulf coast of the United States. Now can
you locate Old Faithful, 44°30'N and 110°150'W, on a map?

What if you want to know the latitude and longitude of your location? If
you know where you are on a map, point to the place with your fingers.
Take one finger and move it along the latitude line to find your
latitude. Then move another finger along the longitude line to find your
longitude.

#### Global Positioning System {#2.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFBvc2l0aW9uaW5nIFN5c3RlbQ.._12-2ud}

In order to get latitude, longitude, and elevation you need several
instruments. What if you could do the same thing with only one
instrument? A **Global Positioning System (GPS)** receiver is all that
is needed to locate your position on the Earth’s surface in many places.

By 1993, the United States military had launched 24 satellites to help
soldiers locate their positions on battlefields. This system of
satellites was called the Global Positioning System (GPS). Later, the
United States government allowed the public to use this system. Here’s
how it works.

**Figure 2.32**

\(a) You need a GPS receiver to use the GPS system. (b) It takes signals
from four GPS satellites to find your location precisely on the surface.

</div>

You must have a GPS receiver to use the system. You can buy many types
of these in stores. The GPS receiver detects radio signals from nearby
GPS satellites. There are precise clocks on each satellite and in the
receiver. The receiver measures the time for radio signals from
satellites to reach it. The receiver uses the time and the speed of
radio signals to calculate the distance between the receiver and the
satellite. The receiver does this with at least four different
satellites to locate its position on the Earth’s surface ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wNDA4) ). GPS receivers are now being
built into many items, such as cell phones and cars.

You can use a GPS meter to tell you how to get to Old Faithful.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-rhq}

-   Latitude is the distance north or south of the Equator. It is
    expressed as a number between 0° and 90° north or south.
-   Longitude is the distance east or west of the Prime Meridian. It is
    expressed as a number between 0° and 180° east or west.
-   The global positioning system uses satellites to display very
    accurate location information on a special receiver.

**How do you indicate which way the wind blows?**

When an object is moving, it is not enough to describe its location. We
also need to know direction. For example, a wind blows a storm over your
school. Where is that storm coming from? Where is it going? Direction is
also needed to indicate where two points are relative to each other on a
map.

### Direction {#2.html#x-ck12-RGlyZWN0aW9u_13-mjy}

To connect two points accurately you need a direction. This occurs when
you need to go from point A to point B. It also happens if you want to
describe where something is going. If you are walking across a field,
for example, you might say you're going north 20° east.

#### Compass {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFzcw.._13-btl}

The most common way to find direction is by using a **compass** . A
compass is a device with a floating needle ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db21wYXNzQ29tcG9zaXRl) ). The needle
is a small magnet that aligns itself with the Earth’s magnetic field.
The compass needle always points to magnetic north. If you have a
compass and you find north, you can then know any other direction. See
the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a **compass rose** .

![Picture of a compass and a compass

**Figure 2.33**

\(a) A compass is a device that is used to determine direction. The
needle points to Earth’s magnetic north pole. (b) A compass rose shows
the four major directions, plus intermediates between them.

</div>

A compass needle lines up with Earth’s magnetic north pole. This is
different from Earth’s geographic north pole, also called true north.
The geographic north pole is the top of an imaginary line. This line is
the axis around which Earth rotates. The geographic north pole is much
like the spindle of a spinning top. The location of the geographic north
pole does not change. However, the magnetic north pole shifts in
location over time. Depending on where you live, you can correct for the
difference between the two poles when you use a map and a compass (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FYXJ0aHNNYWduZXRpY0ZpZWxk)
).

Some maps have a double compass rose. This allows users to make the
corrections between magnetic north and true north. An example is a
nautical chart that boaters use to chart their positions at sea (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMtMDItMDEtMDQ.) ).

#### Polar Coordinate System {#2.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgQ29vcmRpbmF0ZSBTeXN0ZW0._13-31t}

You can also use a polar coordinate system. Your location is marked by
an angle and distance from some reference point. The angle is usually
the angle between your location, the reference point, and a line
pointing north. The distance is given in meters or kilometers. To find
your location or to move from place to place, you need a map, a compass,
and some way to measure your distance, such as a range finder.

Suppose you need to go from your location to a marker that is 20°E and
500 m from your current position. You must do the following:

-   Use the compass and compass rose on the map to orient your map
    with north.
-   Use the compass to find which direction is 20°E.
-   Walk 500 meters in that direction to reach your destination.
-   Polar coordinates are used in a sport called orienteering. People
    who do orienteering use a compass and a map with polar coordinates.
    Participants find their way along a course across wilderness terrain
    ( **Figure**
    [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PcmllbnRlZXJpbmdNYXA.) ). They
    move to various checkpoints along the course. The winner is the
    person who completes the course in the fastest time.

-   Direction is expressed as north, south, east, or west, or some
    gradation between them.
-   A compass can be used to indicate direction. A compass rose shows
    direction on a map or chart.
-   To find your location or to move from place to place, you need a

**Where are you in the third dimension?**

Mt. Sheridan in Yellowstone National Park is higher above sea level than
most locations. It is at 10,250 ft (3,124 m). When you're up at that
elevation, you definitely think about the third dimension. It is, of
course, elevation, or height above sea level. You can see Mt. Sheridan
in the opening image and on the map.

### Elevation {#2.html#x-ck12-RWxldmF0aW9u_14-7ir}

As you know, the surface of Earth is not flat. Some places are high, and
some places are low. For example, mountain ranges like the Sierra Nevada
in California or the Andes in South America are high above the
surrounding areas. An accurate location must take into account the third
dimension. **Elevation** is the height above or below sea level. **Sea
level** refers to the height of the ocean’s surface. This is the
midpoint between high and low tide. Sea level can vary from place to
place, but scientists base their elevation measurements on the average,
or mean, sea level to make sure they have a standard reference point.

### Topography {#2.html#x-ck12-VG9wb2dyYXBoeQ.._14-uur}

We can describe the **topography** of a region by measuring the height
or depth of that feature relative to sea level ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMtMDItMDEtMDU.) ). You might measure your
height relative to your classmates. When your class lines up, some kids
make high “mountains,” while others are more like small hills!

**What information does a map show?**

Maps can convey a lot of different types of information. They can tell
you where you are, or they can tell you something about a location. Maps
can display the relief of an area. They can indicate something about the
society that lives in the area. Different types of maps show many
different types of things.

### Maps as Models {#2.html#x-ck12-TWFwcyBhcyBNb2RlbHM._15-jbb}

Imagine you are going on a road trip. Perhaps you are going on vacation.
How do you know where to go? Most likely, you will use a map. A **map**
is a picture of specific parts of Earth’s surface. There are many types
of maps. Each map gives us different information. Let’s look at a road
map, which is the probably the most common map that you use ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjAx) ).

A road map of the state of Florida. What information can you get from
this map?

</div>

#### Map Legends {#2.html#x-ck12-TWFwIExlZ2VuZHM._15-vlh}

You can see the following on this road map of Florida ( **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjAx) ):

-   The boundaries of the state show its shape.
-   Black dots represent the cities. Each city is named. The size of the
    dot represents the population of the city.
-   Red and brown lines show major roads that connect the cities.
-   Blue lines show rivers. Their names are written in blue.
-   Blue areas show lakes and other waterways: the Gulf of Mexico,
    Biscayne Bay, and Lake Okeechobee. Names for bodies of water are
    also written in blue.
-   A line or scale of miles shows the distance represented on the map;
    an inch or centimeter on the map represents a certain amount of
    distance (miles or kilometers).
-   Look for the legend on the top left side of the map. The legend
    explains other features and symbols on the map.
-   It is the convention for north to be at the top of a map. For this
    reason, a compass rose is not needed on most maps.

You can use this map to find your way around Florida and get from one
place to another along roadways.

#### Types of Maps {#2.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTWFwcw.._15-0gw}

There are many other types of maps other than road maps. Some examples
include:

-   Political or geographic maps show the outlines and borders of states
    and/or countries.
-   Satellite view maps show terrains and vegetation: forests, deserts,
    and mountains.
-   Relief maps show elevations of areas. They are usually on a larger
    scale, such as the whole Earth, rather than a local area.
-   Topographic maps show detailed elevations of features on the map.
-   Climate maps show average temperatures and rainfall.
-   Precipitation maps show the amount of rainfall in different areas.
-   Weather maps show storms, air masses, and fronts.
-   Radar maps show storms and rainfall.
-   Geologic maps detail the types and locations of rocks found in
    an area.

These are but a few types of maps that various Earth scientists might
use. You can easily carry a map around in your pocket or bag. Maps are
easy to use, because they are flat or two-dimensional. However, the
world is three-dimensional. So, how do mapmakers represent a
three-dimensional world on flat paper?

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-2bg}

-   Maps are two-dimensional representations of a surface,
    usually Earth's.
-   Maps use symbols and have legends. This is so they can display the
    most amount of information in the least amount of space.
-   There are many types of maps. They can show social and political
    information; they can show scientific information.

**How does Greenland change size?**

Greenland does not change size! Different map projections make Greenland
appear to be a different size. The Mercator projection makes everything
that is near the polar areas appear too large. The Mollweide projection
distorts the size of the polar regions much less. To see the actual size
of Greenland, look at a globe.

### Map Projections {#2.html#x-ck12-TWFwIFByb2plY3Rpb25z_16-xjk}

Earth is a round, three-dimensional ball. In a small area, Earth looks
flat, so it is not hard to make accurate maps of a small place. When
mapmakers want to map the round Earth on flat paper, they use
projections. What happens if you try to flatten out the skin of a peeled
orange? Or if you try to gift wrap a soccer ball? To flatten out, the
orange peel must rip, and its shape must become distorted. To wrap a
round object with flat paper requires lots of extra cuts and folds. A
**projection** is a way to represent Earth’s curved surface on flat
paper ( **Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjAy) ).

**Figure 2.40**

A map projection translates Earth's curved surface onto two dimensions.

</div>

There are many types of projections. Each uses a different way to change
three dimensions into two dimensions.

There are two basic methods that the mapmaker uses in projections:

-   The mapmaker “slices” the sphere in some way and unfolds it to make
    a flat map. This is like flattening out an orange peel.
-   The mapmaker can look at the sphere from a certain point and then
    translate this view onto a flat paper.

Let’s look at a few commonly used projections.

##### Mercator Projection {#2.html#x-ck12-TWVyY2F0b3IgUHJvamVjdGlvbg.._16-9wc}

In 1569, Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594) ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjA0) ) figured out a way to make a flat
map of our round world. This is called the Mercator projection.

Imagine wrapping the round, ball-shaped Earth with a big, flat piece of
paper. First you make a tube or a cylinder. The cylinder touches Earth
at the Equator. The poles are the farthest points from the cylinder. Now
shine a light from the inside of your model Earth out to the cylinder.
The image projected onto the paper is a Mercator projection. Where does
the projection represent Earth best? Where is it worst? Your map would
be most correct at the Equator. The shapes and sizes of continents
become more stretched out near the poles. Early sailors and navigators
found the Mercator map useful because most explorations were located
near the Equator. Many world maps still use the Mercator projection.

**Figure 2.41**

A Mercator projection translates the curved surface of Earth onto a
cylinder.

</div>

The Mercator projection is best within 15° north or south of the
Equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of
shape. The further the feature is from the Equator, the more out of
shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe,
you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. But look
at the Mercator projection above. Greenland looks almost as big the
United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's
shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its
true dimensions. Why is this true?

In a Mercator projection, all compass directions are straight lines.
This makes it a good type of map for navigation. The top of the map is
north, the bottom is south, the left side is west and the right side is
east. However, because it is a flat map of a curved surface, a straight
line on the map is not the shortest distance between the two points it
connects.

#### Conic Projection {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29uaWMgUHJvamVjdGlvbg.._16-gdv}

Instead of a cylinder, you could wrap the flat paper into a cone. Conic
map projections use a cone shape to better represent regions near the
poles ( **Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjA1) ). Conic
projections are best where the cone shape touches the globe. This is
along a line of latitude, usually the Equator.

#### Gnomonic Projection {#2.html#x-ck12-R25vbW9uaWMgUHJvamVjdGlvbg.._16-9wx}

What if you want a different approach? Let's say you don't want to wrap
a flat piece of paper around a round object. You could put a flat piece
of paper right on the area that you want to map. This type of map is
called a gnomonic map projection ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjA2) ). The paper only touches Earth at
one point. The sizes and shapes of countries near that point are good.
The poles are often mapped this way to avoid distortion. A gnomic
projection is best for use over a small area.

#### Robinson Projection {#2.html#x-ck12-Um9iaW5zb24gUHJvamVjdGlvbg.._16-tyf}

In 1963, Arthur Robinson made a map with more accurate sizes and shapes
of land areas. He did this using mathematical formulas. The formulas
could directly translate coordinates onto the map. This type of
projection is shaped like an oval rather than a rectangle ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVMwMi0wMjA3) ).

**Figure 2.44**

A Robinson projection better represents the true shapes and sizes of
land areas.

</div>

Robinson’s map is more accurate than a Mercator projection. The shapes
and sizes of continents are closer to true. Robinson's map is best
within 45° of the Equator. Distances along the Equator and the lines
parallel to it are true. However, the scales along each line of latitude
are different. In 1988, the National Geographic Society began to use
Robinson’s projection for its world maps.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-x5l}

-   A map projection is a way to show a three-dimensional figure in
    two dimensions.
-   All map projections have some distortion. Different types have
    distortions in different locations and of different amounts.
-   Robinson's project is different from the rest because it uses
    mathematical formulas. Other projections are best at one point.

**Can a map help you understand a place even if you've never been
there?**

Hills, streams, valleys, and snowfields all show up on some types of
maps. With practice, people can look at a topographic map and see what
the landscape is really like. Of course, it's not the same as being
there! But a topographic map can give you a good feel for an area before
you go. It can also help you to identify features once you are there.
What does this map tell you about the region? Can you identify features
that appear in the photo on the map?

### Topographic Maps {#2.html#x-ck12-VG9wb2dyYXBoaWMgTWFwcw.._17-dtw}

The topography of a region can be shown on a map. **Topographic maps**
represent geographical features, such as hills and valleys. Topographic
maps use contour lines to show geographical features. A **contour line**
is a line of equal elevation. If you walk along a contour line, you will
not go uphill or downhill. Topographic maps are also called contour
maps. The rules of topographic maps are:

-   Each line connects all points of a specific elevation.
-   Contour lines never cross. After all, a single point can only have
    one elevation.
-   Every fifth contour line is bolded and labeled.
-   Adjacent contour lines are separated by a constant difference in
    elevation (such as 20 feet or 100 feet). The difference in elevation
    is the **contour interval** . The contour interval is indicated in
    the map legend.
-   Scales indicate horizontal distance and are also found on the
    map legend.

#### Interpreting Contour Maps {#2.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJwcmV0aW5nIENvbnRvdXIgTWFwcw.._17-1rc}

How does a topographic map tell you about the terrain? Let’s consider
the following principles:

1\. **The spacing of contour lines shows the slope of the land** .
Contour lines that are close together indicate a steep slope. This is
because the elevation changes quickly in a small area. Contour lines
that seem to touch indicate a very steep slope, like a cliff. When
contour lines are spaced far apart, the slope is gentle. So contour
lines help us see the three-dimensional shape of the land.

Look at the topographic map of Stowe, Vermont ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVNfMi4zLjQ.) ). There is a steep hill rising
just to the right of the city of Stowe. You can tell this because the
contour lines there are closely spaced. The contour lines also show that
the hill has a sharp rise of about 200 feet. Then the slope becomes less
steep toward the right.

2\. **Concentric circles indicate a hill** . Pictured below is another
side of the topographic map of Stowe, Vermont ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVNfMi4zLjU.) ). When contour lines form closed
loops, there is a hill. The smallest loops are the higher elevations on
the hill. The larger loops encircling the smaller loops are downhill. If
you look at the map, you can see Cady Hill in the lower left and
another, smaller hill in the upper right.

3\. **Hatched concentric circles indicate a depression** . The hatch
marks are short, perpendicular lines inside the circle. The innermost
hatched circle represents the deepest part of the depression (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RXMwMjAzLTA2) ). The outer hatched
circles represent higher elevations.

there is water running through the valley. If there is not a blue line,

5\. **Like other maps, topographic maps have a scale so that you can find
the horizontal distance** . You can use the horizontal scale to
calculate the slope of the land (vertical height/horizontal distance).
Common scales used in United States Geological Service (USGS) maps
include the following:

-   1:24,000 scale – 1 inch = 2000 feet
-   1:100,000 scale – 1 inch = 1.6 miles
-   1:250,000 scale – 1 inch = 4 miles

Including contour lines, contour intervals, circles, and V-shapes allows
a topographic map to show three-dimensional information on a flat piece
of paper. A topographic map gives us a good idea of the shape of the
land.

### Geologic Maps {#2.html#x-ck12-R2VvbG9naWMgTWFwcw.._17-8b4}

A geologic map shows the different rocks that are exposed at the surface
of a region. The geology is often put on a contour map. Rock units are
shown in a color identified in a key. On the geologic map of the Grand
Canyon, for example, different rock types are shown in different colors.
Some people call the Grand Canyon “layer cake geology“ because most of
the rock units are in layers. Rock units show up on both sides of a
stream valley.

A geologic map looks very complicated in a region where rock layers have
been folded. Faults are seen on this geologic map cutting across rock
layers. When rock layers are tilted, you will see stripes of each layer
on the map. There are symbols on a geologic map that tell you which
direction the rock layers slant. Often there is a cut away diagram,
called a **cross section** . A cross section shows what the rock layers
look like below the surface. A large-scale geologic map will just show
geologic provinces. They do not show the detail of individual rock
layers.

**Is it true that we know more about the dark side of the Moon than we
do about the oceans?**

It's true! Why do you think so? The oceans are deep, dark, and frigid.
All but the very top surface is under extraordinarily high pressure.
It's hard to imagine an environment that's less hospitable to human
life! Yet, as you will see, we know quite a bit about the oceans. This
is due mostly to technology. Rovers, like the one pictured above, allow
scientists to remotely visit places that are too inhospitable for human
life.

### Studying the Seafloor {#2.html#x-ck12-U3R1ZHlpbmcgdGhlIFNlYWZsb29y_18-vm0}

Scuba divers can only dive to about 40 meters. When they dive deep, they
cannot stay down for very long. Therefore, scuba divers can only observe
the organisms and ecosystems very near a coast. Most oceanic research
requires accessing greater depths.

#### Seafloor Bathymetry {#2.html#x-ck12-U2VhZmxvb3IgQmF0aHltZXRyeQ.._18-yl3}

How do scientists create bathymetric maps? Early explorers mapped the
seafloor by painstakingly dropping a line over the side of a ship. They
measured the length of the line when it touched bottom. With this
method, they could measure the depth, one tiny spot at a time. During
World War II, battleships and submarines carried **echo sounders** .
Echo sounders were developed to locate enemy submarines. Early echo
sounders had a single beam. The beam bounced off the nearest object and
then returned to the ship. Scientists know the speed of sound in
seawater. They can then calculate the distance to the object based on
the time it takes for the wave to make a round trip. This allowed them
to create a line of depth measurements. Modern echo sounders produce
sound waves that travel outward in all directions ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA2MDMtMDE.) ).

#### Bathymetric Maps {#2.html#x-ck12-QmF0aHltZXRyaWMgTWFwcw.._18-kox}

Topographic maps that show water depths are called **bathymetric maps**
. An example of one is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RXMwMjAzLTA4) ). Bathymetric maps are made of any
water body, including lakes and oceans. On these maps, the contour lines
represent depth below the surface. Therefore, high numbers are deeper
depths and low numbers are shallow depths.

Bathymetric maps are made from depth soundings or sonar data. They help
oceanographers understand the shape of bottoms of lakes, bays, and the
ocean. This information also helps boaters navigate safely.

#### Water Sampling {#2.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgU2FtcGxpbmc._18-6ml}

Scientists need to sample seawater (or lake water) from different
depths. To sample seawater, bottles are placed along a cable at regular
depths ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTQtMjMtTmlza2luLWJvdHRsZQ..) ). When
they are in position, a weight is dropped down the cable. This closes
the bottles. The water trapped in the bottle can be analyzed in a
laboratory. This allows scientists to understand ocean or lake
chemistry.

Scientists also collect rock and sediment samples from the seafloor. A
dredge is a giant rectangular bucket that is dragged along behind a
ship. The dredge picks up loose rocks lying on the seafloor. Gravity
corers are metal tubes that fall to the seafloor. They slice into the
sediments to collect a sample. The research vessel, the *Joides
Resolution* , drills deep into the seafloor to collect samples of the
sediment and ocean crust. Scientists analyze the samples for chemistry
and their magnetic properties.

#### Submersibles {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VibWVyc2libGVz_18-uly}

Samples of seawater and rocks can be collected directly by scientists in
a **submersible** . These subs can take scientists down to make
observations. The subs have arms for collecting samples. The human
operated vehicle, Alvin can dive up to 4,500 meters beneath the ocean
surface and has made more than 4,600 dives since 1964 ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RVNfc3VibWVyc2libGU.) ).

#### Remotely Operated Vehicles {#2.html#x-ck12-UmVtb3RlbHkgT3BlcmF0ZWQgVmVoaWNsZXM._18-dhq}

Sending humans to the seafloor is expensive and dangerous. Having to
return humans safely to the surface limits what a mission can do.
**Remotely operated vehicles** , or ROVs, allow scientists to study the
deep without going to the seafloor. These small vehicles carry cameras
and scientific instruments. ROVs were used to study inside the *Titanic*
. This would have been far too dangerous for a manned sub to enter.
Scientists control ROVs electronically with sophisticated operating
systems.

Footage of the NOAA *Titanic* Expedition of 2004 is visible in this
video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z7REEnwKOQ](watch?v=6Z7REEnwKOQ)

**How do scientists learn about space?**

Many scientists can touch the materials they study. Most can do
experiments to test those materials. Biologists can collect cells,
seeds, or sea urchins to study in the laboratory. Physicists can test
the strength of metal or smash atoms into each other. Geologists can
chip away at rocks and test their chemistry. What can astronomers use to
study space? Light and other electromagnetic waves, of course. This is
the Andromeda Galaxy as it appeared 2.5 million years ago. Why is the
light so old?

### Electromagnetic Spectrum {#2.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFNwZWN0cnVt_19-n7n}

Earth is just a tiny speck in the Universe. Our planet is surrounded by
lots of space. Light travels across empty space. Light is the visible
part of the **electromagnetic spectrum** . Astronomers use the light and
other energy that comes to us to gather information about the Universe.

#### The Speed of Light {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNwZWVkIG9mIExpZ2h0_19-8xn}

In space, light travels at about 300,000,000 meters per second
(670,000,000 miles per hour). How fast is that? A beam of light could
travel from New York to Los Angeles and back again nearly 40 times in
just one second. Even at that amazing rate, objects in space are so far
away that it takes a lot of time for their light to reach us. Even light
from the nearest star, our sun, takes about eight minutes to reach
Earth.

#### Light-Years {#2.html#x-ck12-TGlnaHQtWWVhcnM._19-vwj}

We need a really big unit to measure distances out in space because
distances between stars are so great. A **light-year** , 9.5 trillion
kilometers (5.9 trillion miles), is the distance that light travels in
one year. That’s a long way! Out in space, it’s actually a pretty short
distance.

Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us after the Sun. This near
neighbor is 4.22 light-years away. That means the light from Proxima
Centauri takes 4.22 years to reach us. Our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy,
is about 100,000 light-years across. So it takes light 100,000 years to
travel from one side of the galaxy to the other! It turns out that even
100,000 light-years is a short distance. The most distant galaxies we
have detected are more than 13 billion light-years away. That’s over a
hundred-billion-trillion kilometers!

#### Looking Back in Time {#2.html#x-ck12-TG9va2luZyBCYWNrIGluIFRpbWU._19-rym}

When we look at stars and galaxies, we are seeing over great distances.
More importantly, we are also seeing back in time. When we see a distant
galaxy, we are actually seeing how the galaxy used to look. For example,
the Whirlpool Galaxy is about 23 million light-years from Earth (
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XaGlybHBvb2xHYWxheHk.) ).
When you see an image of the galaxy what are you seeing? You are seeing
the galaxy as it was 23 million years ago!

Universe's history. Check out
[http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/08feb\_gravlens.htm](08feb_gravlens.htm)
to see how this is true.

#### Electromagnetic Waves {#2.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFdhdmVz_19-lkg}

Light is one type of **electromagnetic radiation** . Light is energy
that travels in the form of an electromagnetic wave. Pictured below is a
diagram of an electromagnetic wave ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FTVdhdmU.) ). An electromagnetic (EM)
wave has two parts: an electric field and a magnetic field. The electric
and magnetic fields vibrate up and down, which makes the wave.

**Figure 2.55**

An electromagnetic wave has oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

</div>

The **wavelength** is the horizontal distance between two of the same
points on the wave, like wave crest to wave crest. A wave’s
**frequency** measures the number of wavelengths that pass a given point
every second. As wavelength increases, frequency decreases. This means
that as wavelengths get shorter, more waves move past a particular spot
in the same amount of time.

#### The Electromagnetic Spectrum {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVsZWN0cm9tYWduZXRpYyBTcGVjdHJ1bQ.._19-nbm}

**Visible light** is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum (
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVNfUFNfNV81XzVfZWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljc3BlY3RydW0.)
) that humans can see. Visible light includes all the colors of the
rainbow. Each color is determined by its wavelength. Visible light
ranges from violet wavelengths of 400 nanometers (nm) through red at 700
nm.

Visible light is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
There are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that humans cannot see.
This radiation exists all around you. You just can’t see it! Every star,
including our Sun, emits radiation of many wavelengths. Astronomers can
learn a lot from studying the details of the spectrum of radiation from
a star.

</div>

Many extremely interesting objects can’t be seen with the unaided eye.
Astronomers use telescopes to see objects at wavelengths all across the
electromagnetic spectrum. Some very hot stars emit light primarily at
ultraviolet wavelengths. There are extremely hot objects that emit
X-rays and even gamma rays. Some very cool stars shine mostly in the
infrared light wavelengths. Radio waves come from the faintest, most
distant objects.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-cts}

-   Electromagnetic radiation is energy transmitted as waves with
    different wavelengths. This makes up the electromagnetic spectrum.
-   Light travels very fast but still takes a long time to get
    across space. A light-year is the distance light can travel in
    one year.
-   From longest wavelengths to shortest wavelengths the electromagnetic
    spectrum is: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light,
    ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.

**What would Galileo think of the things we can see through a
telescope?**

Galileo's telescopes could see about as much as a regular pair of
binoculars today. Galileo could see four moons of Jupiter. This was four
more than could be seen with the naked eye. But we now know that there
are 66 moons. Galileo would be astonished to see all of Jupiter's moons.
And imagine what he would think of the galaxies!

### Types of Telescopes {#2.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgVGVsZXNjb3Blcw.._20-pvg}

Humans have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of
years. The term "telescope" was coined by the Italian scientist and
mathematician Galileo Galilei (1564–1642). Galileo built the first
telescope in 1608. His telescope used two lenses to make distant objects
appear both nearer and larger. He subsequently made many improvements to
telescope design.

#### Optical Telescopes {#2.html#x-ck12-T3B0aWNhbCBUZWxlc2NvcGVz_20-vjg}

Telescopes that use lenses to bend light are called **refracting
telescopes** , or refractors ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjMtMDQtcmVmcmFjdG9ycw..) ). The earliest
telescopes were all refractors. Many amateur astronomers still use
refractors today. Refractors are good for viewing details within our
solar system. Craters on the surface of Earth’s Moon or the rings around
Saturn are two such details.

**Figure 2.57**

Refracting telescopes can be very large.

</div>

Around 1670, Sir Isaac Newton built a different kind of telescope.
Newton's telescope used curved mirrors instead of lenses to focus light.
This type of telescope is called a **reflecting telescope** , or
reflector.

It’s much easier to precisely make mirrors than to precisely make glass
lenses. Mirrors are also much lighter than heavy glass lenses. For these
two reasons, mirrors can be made larger than lenses. This is important
because a reflecting telescope can be made much larger. Larger
telescopes can collect more light. This means that they can study dimmer
or more distant objects. The largest optical telescopes in the world
today are reflectors. Telescopes also can be made to use both lenses and
mirrors.

For more on how telescopes were developed, visit
[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html](telescope.html)
.

#### Radio Telescopes {#2.html#x-ck12-UmFkaW8gVGVsZXNjb3Blcw.._20-f5a}

**Radio telescopes** collect radio waves. These telescopes are even
larger telescopes than reflectors. Radio telescopes look a lot like
satellite dishes. In fact, both are designed to collect and focus radio
waves or microwaves from space.

The largest single radio telescope in the world is at the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BcmVjaWJvT2JzZXJ2YXRvcnlBZXJpYWw.) ).
This telescope is located in a natural hole in the ground. This
telescope would collapse under its own weight if it were not supported
by the ground. There is a big disadvantage to this design. What do you
think it is? The telescope can only observe the part of the sky that
happens to be overhead at a given time.

A group of radio telescopes can be linked together with a computer. The
telescopes observe the same object. The computer then combines the data
from each telescope. This makes the group function like one single
telescope. An example is pictured below ( **Figure**

#### Space Telescopes {#2.html#x-ck12-U3BhY2UgVGVsZXNjb3Blcw.._20-bfr}

Telescopes on Earth all have one big problem: incoming light must pass
through the atmosphere. This blocks some wavelengths of radiation. Also,
motion in the atmosphere distorts light. You see this when you see stars
twinkling in the night sky. Many observatories are built on high
mountains. There is less air above the telescope, so there is less
interference from the atmosphere. **Space telescopes** avoid problems
from the atmosphere completely since they orbit outside the atmosphere.

The Hubble Space Telescope ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjMtMDgtaHViYmxlLXRlbGVzY29wZQ..) ) is
the best known space telescope. Hubble began operations in 1994. Since
then, it has provided huge amounts of data. The telescope has helped
astronomers answer many of the biggest questions in astronomy.

**Why are satellites important?**

In 1900, a category 4 hurricane devastated Galveston, Texas. It claimed
the lives of between 6,000 and 12,000 people. By contrast, the death
toll from Hurricane Katrina was about 1,800 people. Why the difference?
Although Hurricane Katrina was a modern tragedy, it would have been much
worse without the advance warning of many weather satellites.

### Rockets {#2.html#x-ck12-Um9ja2V0cw.._21-rjd}

Humans did not reach space until the second half of the 20th century.
They needed somehow to break past Earth's gravity. A **rocket** moves
rapidly in one direction. The device is propelled by particles flying
out of it at high speed in the other direction.

#### How Rockets Work {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IFJvY2tldHMgV29yaw.._21-hpq}

Rockets were used for centuries in wars and for fireworks before anyone
could explain how they worked. In 1687 Sir Isaac Newton developed his
Laws of Motion. The third law says: To every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction. In other words, when a rocket's propulsion pushes
in one direction, the rocket moves in the opposite direction (
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjMtMTItcm9ja2V0LXJlYWN0aW9uLWFjdGlvbg..)
).

**Figure 2.62**

A rocket pushes in one direction so that it moves in the opposite
direction.

</div>

For a long time, many people believed that a rocket wouldn’t work in
space. There would be nothing for the rocket to push against. But they
do work! Fuel is ignited in a chamber. The gases in the chamber explode.
The explosion creates pressure that forces the gases out of one side of
the rocket. The rocket moves in the opposite direction ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1GaW5hbFNwYWNlU2h1dHRsZUxhdW5jaA..) ).
The force pushing the rocket is called **thrust** .

**Figure 2.63**

This Space Shuttle launch shows how the thrust of the rocket pushes the
shuttle upward into the sky.

</div>

#### A Rocket Revolution {#2.html#x-ck12-QSBSb2NrZXQgUmV2b2x1dGlvbg.._21-ord}

For centuries, rockets were powered by gunpowder or other solid fuels.
These rockets could travel only short distances. Around the turn of the
20th century, liquid fuel rockets were developed. Liquid fuel gave the
rockets enough power to escape Earth’s gravity. By using multiple
stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This reduced the mass of
the rocket so that it could fly higher.

### Satellites {#2.html#x-ck12-U2F0ZWxsaXRlcw.._21-l0h}

One of the first uses of rockets in space was to launch satellites. A
**satellite** is an object that orbits a larger object. An **orbit** is
a circular or elliptical path around an object. Natural objects in orbit
are called natural satellites. The Moon is a natural satellite.
Human-made objects in orbit are called artificial satellites.

#### How a Satellite Stays in Orbit {#2.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgU2F0ZWxsaXRlIFN0YXlzIGluIE9yYml0_21-fjh}

Newton’s law of universal gravitation describes how an object can orbit
a planet. Every object in the Universe is attracted to every other
object by gravity. Gravity also keeps you from floating away into the
sky. Why doesn't gravity cause satellites to crash into Earth?

Newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible.
Imagine a cannonball launched from a high mountain ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OZXd0b25zQ2Fubm9uYmFsbFRoZW9yeQ..) ).
If the cannonball is launched at a slow speed, it will fall back to
Earth. This is shown as paths (A) and (B). If the cannonball is launched
at a fast speed, Earth curves away at the same rate that the cannonball
falls. The cannonball then goes into a circular orbit, as in path (C).
If the cannonball is launched even faster, it could go into an
elliptical orbit (D). It might even leave Earth’s gravity and go into
space (E).

![Isaac Newton cannonball
orbit](ck12_2_files/20150911025606722612.png "Isaac Newton cannonball orbit")

**Figure 2.64**

Isaac Newton explained how a cannonball fired from a high point with
enough speed could orbit Earth.

</div>

Unfortunately, Newton’s idea would not work in real life. A cannonball
launched at a fast speed from Mt. Everest would burn up in the
atmosphere. However, a rocket can launch straight up, then steer into
orbit. It won't burn up in the atmosphere. So a rocket can carry a
satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into
orbit.

#### Satellite Orbits {#2.html#x-ck12-U2F0ZWxsaXRlIE9yYml0cw.._21-f5i}

Satellites have different views depending on their orbit. Satellites may
be put in a low orbit. These satellites orbit from north to south over
the poles. These satellites view a different part of Earth each time
they circle. Imaging and weather satellites need this type of view.

Satellites may be placed so that they orbit at the same rate the Earth
spins. The satellite then remains over the same location on the surface.
Communications satellites are often placed in these orbits.

#### Types of Satellites {#2.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgU2F0ZWxsaXRlcw.._21-2qn}

The first artificial satellite was launched just over 50 years ago.
Thousands are now in orbit around Earth. Satellites also orbit the Moon,
the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Satellites have many
different purposes. There are satellites for communications and
navigation. There are satellites for taking pictures of a planet's
surface.

Dozens of satellites collect data about Earth. NASA’s Landsat satellites
make detailed images of Earth’s continents and coastal areas. Other
satellites study the oceans, atmosphere, polar ice sheets, and other
Earth systems. This data helps us to monitor climate change. Other
long-term changes in the planet are also best seen from space. Satellite
images help scientists understand how Earth’s systems affect one
another. Different satellites monitor different wavelengths of energy.

### Space Stations {#2.html#x-ck12-U3BhY2UgU3RhdGlvbnM._21-uba}

Humans have a presence in space at the International Space Station (ISS)
( **Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTIzMDMtMDU.) ). Modern
space stations are constructed piece by piece to create a modular
system. The primary purpose of the ISS is scientific research,
especially in medicine, biology, and physics.

shuttle Atlantis in June 2007.

#### Space Shuttles {#2.html#x-ck12-U3BhY2UgU2h1dHRsZXM._21-oxw}

Craft designed for human spaceflight, like the Apollo missions, were
very successful. They were also very expensive and could not carry much
cargo. They could be used only once. To outfit the ISS, NASA needed a
space vehicle that was reusable. It needed to be able to carry large
pieces of equipment. The cargo might include satellites, space
telescopes, or sections of a space station. The resulting spacecraft is
called a **space shuttle** ( **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTIzMDMtMDY.) ).

Atlantis on the launch pad in 2006. Since 1981, the space shuttle has
been the United States’ primary vehicle for carrying people and large
equipment into space.

</div>

A space shuttle has three main parts. The part you are probably most
familiar with is the **orbiter** . The orbiter has wings like an
airplane. When a space shuttle launches, the orbiter is attached to a
huge fuel tank that contains liquid fuel. On the sides of the fuel tank
are two large "booster rockets." All of this is needed to get the
orbiter out of Earth’s atmosphere. Once in space, the orbiter can be
used to release equipment (such as a satellite or supplies for the
International Space Station). It can be used to repair existing
equipment, such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Astronauts can even do
experiments directly on board the orbiter.

When the mission is complete, the orbiter re-enters Earth’s atmosphere.
The craft flies back to Earth more like a glider than an airplane. The
Space Shuttle program did 135 missions between 1981 and 2011, when the
remaining shuttles were retired. Since the space shuttles have retired,
the ISS is serviced by Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

You can visit the retired shuttles around the country:

-   Enterprise at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, New York City.
-   Discovery at the National Air and Space Museum, Chantilly Virginia.
-   Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
-   Endeavour at the California Science Center, Los Angeles.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-t8d}

-   Rockets are propelled into space by particles flying out one end at
    high speed. This allows them to escape gravity.
-   Thousands of artificial satellites orbit Earth. Satellites are used
    for imaging, communications, navigation, and human habitation.
-   Space stations are continuously inhabited by humans. The humans
    reach the space station by space shuttle.

## Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-kmo}

Science is different from other ways of understanding the world. Science
has a rigorous method of getting information. A scientific idea must be
testable; it must be falsifiable. Scientific ideas are not the result of
opinion, gut feelings, or faith. Ideas that are not supported by
observations and data are revised or thrown out. Scientists use the
scientific method to answer questions about the natural world. The
scientific method is not linear. A step may need to be revised or thrown
out. New data send the scientist back to the beginning. Still scientific
inquiry takes on this basic structure: Ask a question. Do background
research. Propose a hypothesis. Test the hypothesis using data from
observations and experiments. Continue testing the hypothesis if it
holds up or find a new hypothesis if it does not. Eventually create a
theory. A theory is an explanation of a complicated set of phenomena. A
theory fits virtually all of the available data. The theories of
evolution, plate tectonics, and climate change are crucial to
understanding Earth. These theories may be revised, but they will almost
certainly hold up. Earth scientists learn about the world by using a lot
of amazing tools and scientific principles. To understand things that
are small or far away, scientists use a microscope or a telescope. To
learn about things on the ground, they use a map. Rocks and other Earth
materials are analyzed in the lab. Technology allows us to learn more
about the oceans and space. One of the most important principles—and the
most important for understanding Earth history—is that "the present is
the key to the past."

**Is Earth a planet?**

Yes! No one doubts that Earth is a planet. But Earth is a lot different
from the other planets in our solar system. The outer planets are huge
and made of gas, like Jupiter. The inner planets are also different,
like scorching-hot Venus. Earth is different because it has liquid
water. It also has life! Life may be found on another planet or moon in
our solar system. But it will not be intelligent life. We humans have
looked around to know that! There was a planet that was really different
from the other planets. That planet is no longer a planet. Pluto is now
categorized as a dwarf planet. To decide what to do with Pluto,
scientists had to decide what a planet is. We will look at some of the
characteristics that make Earth a bona fide planet.

**What is a flat-earther?**

Flat-earther is a term used to describe someone who believes something
despite the evidence. Or who does not believe something despite the
evidence. There are actually people who believe that Earth is flat. They
say that satellite photos are faked. They believe that the Apollo Moon
landings were faked. But there are very few people alive today who
actually believe that Earth is flat. There are, however, plenty of
people who can be called flat-earthers. These people believe (or
disbelieve) something despite the evidence.

### Earth’s Shape {#3.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIFNoYXBl-tj2}

As you walk around, the ground looks flat. So why do you think that
Earth is round? The best reason is that we have pictures of Earth taken
from space. These photos show that Earth is round. Astronauts aboard the
Apollo 17 shuttle took this one, called “The Blue Marble” ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMDEtRWFydGg.) ). Earth looks like a
giant blue and white ball.

**Figure 3.1**

This is how the Earth looks from space—like a blue and white marble.

</div>

Did people only come to think that Earth is round when spacecrafts took
photos? No! Even the ancient Greeks knew that Earth was round. They
figured this out by observing the arc shape of the shadow on the Moon
during a lunar eclipse. Since Galileo, people can look through a
telescope and see that the planets orbit around the Sun. These
bodies—the Sun and each of the planets—are round. If Earth is a planet,
it is certainly round.

Another way to tell that Earth is round is to look at ships sailing off
into the distance. What do you see when you watch a tall ship sail over
the horizon of the Earth? The bottom part of the ship disappears faster
than the top part ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjQtQm9hdC1ob3Jpem9u) ). What would that
ship look like if Earth were flat? No part of it would disappear before
the other. It would all just get smaller as it moved farther away.

Earth’s curvature is noticeable when objects at a distance are below the

### Hemispheres {#3.html#x-ck12-SGVtaXNwaGVyZXM.-rwf}

Earth is a sphere (technically, an oblate spheroid, a bit squashed at
the poles). As a sphere, it can be divided. Half of a sphere is a
**hemisphere** . Earth is divided into hemispheres: north, south, east,
west ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1IZW1pc3BoZXJlcw..)
).

Remember that the **Equator** is the line that falls at 0°. North of the
Equator is the **Northern Hemisphere** . South of the Equator is the
**Southern Hemisphere** . The North Pole is at 90°N. So there are 90
degree lines in the Northern Hemisphere. The South Pole is 90°S. So
there are 90 degree lines in the Southern Hemisphere.

Earth also has an **Eastern Hemisphere** and a **Western Hemisphere** .
They are just made by humans so that locations can more easily be
specified. The Prime Meridian is 0° longitude and passes through
Greenwich, England. The International Date Line is the 180° meridian.
The Eastern Hemisphere is east of the Prime Meridian to the
International Date Line. It includes eastern Europe and Asia. The
Western Hemisphere west of the Prime Meridian to the International Date
Line. It includes western Europe and the Americas.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-lth}

-   Ancient Greeks knew that Earth was round. They saw the shadow the
    planet cast on the Moon during a lunar eclipse.
-   Through a simple telescope, the other planets appear to be round. So
    Earth must be round.
-   A boat does not get smaller with distance but sinks below
    the horizon. This is more evidence that Earth is round.

**How can you find your way?**

You can use Earth's magnetic field to tell you where you want to go. A
compass needle aligns with Earth’s magnetic field. People can navigate
by finding magnetic north. If you know where north is, you can figure
out how to get anywhere. A compass is great for finding your way when
you're out in the field!

### Earth’s Magnetism {#3.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIE1hZ25ldGlzbQ.._1-xql}

Earth has a **magnetic field** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NYWduZXRpY0ZpZWxk) ). The magnetic
field behaves like a giant bar magnet inside Earth. If you have a large
bar magnet, you can hang it from a string. Then watch as it aligns
itself in a north-south direction. It does this to line up with Earth’s
magnetic field.

Earth's magnetic field is like a bar magnet that resides in the center

The magnetic field has north and south poles. The magnetic poles do not
exactly match the geographic poles. So the North Magnetic Pole is not
the same as the geographic North Pole. The same is true of the South
Pole. The magnetic field is created by the movement of molten metal in
the outer core.

Earth’s magnetic field extends several thousand kilometers into space.
It shields us from harmful radiation from the Sun ( **Figure**

#### Magnetic Reversals {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0aWMgUmV2ZXJzYWxz_1-uye}

Something very strange has happened many times during Earth's history.
The planet's magnetic field flipped! The North Magnetic Pole became the
South Magnetic Pole. The South Magnetic Pole became the North Magnetic
Pole. Scientists are not sure why this happens. The fact that it does
happen is useful to scientists. In the chapter *Plate Tectonics* ,
you'll learn how.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-kp8}

-   Earth's magnetic field is like a bar magnet through the planet.
-   The magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid
    outer core.
-   Occasionally the magnetic field flips. The North Magnetic Pole
    becomes the South Magnetic Pole and the South Magnetic Pole becomes
    the North Magnetic Pole.

**Did you ever hear the old adage: What goes up must come down?**

Every moment of every day is a field trip to gravity. Gravity is
everywhere! You have a gravitational attraction to your dog. You have
one to your pencil. You even have one to your school principal! These
gravitational attractions are very small compared with the most
important one you have. This is your gravitational attraction to Earth.
It's what keeps you from floating off into space. Gravity holds our
planet together. Gravity keeps Earth orbiting the Sun. We wouldn't be
here without gravity.

### The Role of Gravity {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJvbGUgb2YgR3Jhdml0eQ.._2-ykm}

All objects in the universe have an attraction to each other. This
attraction is known as **gravity** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMDUtR3Jhdml0eS1mb3JjZQ..) ). The
strength of the force of gravity depends on two things. One is the mass
of the objects. The other is the distance between the objects. As an
object's mass increases, the attraction increases. As the distance
between the objects increases, the attraction decreases.

**Figure 3.6**

The strength of the force of gravity between objects A and B depends on
the mass of the objects and the distance ( *u* ) between them.

Isaac Newton first described gravity as the force that causes objects to
fall to the ground. Gravity is also the force that keeps the Moon
circling Earth. Gravity keeps Earth circling the Sun. Without gravity,
these objects would fly off into space ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMDQtRWFydGgtbW9vbi1vcmJpdA..) ).

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-tid}

-   All objects have a gravitational attraction to each other. This is
    called gravity.
-   The attraction is proportional to the mass of the objects. The
    attraction is inversely proportional to the distance between
    the objects.
-   Gravity keeps the Moon orbiting Earth. Gravity keeps the planets
    orbiting the Sun.

**How do you know Earth rotates?**

Something amazing happens every day (unless you live very far north or
very far south)! The amazing thing is that the Sun rises in the east. It
also sets in the west. We know that the Sun doesn't actually move around
Earth. What causes the Sun to rise and set is that Earth rotates on its
axis. This rotation creates day and night.

### Earth's Axis of Rotation {#3.html#x-ck12-RWFydGgncyBBeGlzIG9mIFJvdGF0aW9u_3-iud}

Imagine a line passing through the center of Earth. The line exits the
planet at the top and at the bottom. The point at the top is the North
Pole. The point at the bottom is the South Pole. This imaginary line is
called an **axis** . The points are the north and south geographic
poles. The geographic poles are different from the magnetic poles, and
they are in different places on the planet.

**Figure 3.8**

Earth rotates on an axis, an imaginary line that goes from the North
(celestial) Pole to the South (celestial) Pole.

</div>

Note that Earth's axis of rotation is tilted. The axis is not
perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. This plane is the one that
solar system bodies are mostly lined up in.

Earth spins around its axis, just as a top spins around its spindle.
This spinning movement is called **rotation** . The axis is Earth's
**axis of rotation** . Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours.

### Day-Night Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-RGF5LU5pZ2h0IEN5Y2xl_3-9ch}

To an observer looking down at the North Pole, Earth appears to rotate
counterclockwise. From nearly all points on Earth, the Sun appears to
move across the sky from east to west each day. Of course, the Sun is
not moving from east to west at all; Earth is rotating. The Moon and
stars also seem to rise in the east and set in the west.

Earth’s rotation means that there is a cycle of daylight and darkness
approximately every 24 hours. This is the length of a day. Different
places experience sunset and sunrise at different times, and the amount
of daylight and darkness also differs by location.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-7uj}

-   Sun, Moon, and stars appear to travel from east to west each day.
-   Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours.

**Is this an example of the Coriolis effect?**

Does Coriolis determine which direction water in a toilet will swirl?
Unfortunately, no. Friction and the power of the flush have too big an
influence. But in the atmosphere and oceans, Coriolis affects flow
direction.

### Coriolis Effect {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29yaW9saXMgRWZmZWN0_4-fip}

The **Coriolis effect** is not a force, even though that's what it is
sometimes called. Coriolis does not force anything to happen! Coriolis
is an effect. What does that mean?

The Coriolis effect describes how Earth’s rotation steers winds and
surface ocean currents. Unlike land, air and water move freely (in the
absence of obstacles). The Coriolis effect causes the path of a freely
moving object to appear to curve. This is because Earth is rotating
beneath the object. So even though the object's path is straight, it
appears to curve. The curve appears to be to the right in the Northern
Hemisphere. It appears to be to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

Here is an example in the Northern Hemisphere. A plane takes off from
City A . The pilot wants to land in City B, which is 500 miles due
north. But the plane will not arrive there without corrections. City B
was due north of City A when the plane took off. But during the time it
takes for the airplane to fly 500 miles, City B moves east. This happens
because of Earth's rotation. So if the airplane flies due north, it will
arrive at a different city, City C. City C is west of City B (in the
Northern Hemisphere). To reach City B, the pilot should curve right
while flying north. The opposite happens in the Southern Hemisphere. In
the flights between cities pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1GbGlnaHRQYXRo) ), the flight paths
look curved. Since a flight path must curve to the right in the Northern
Hemisphere, can you tell which city the plane took off from in each
case?

The Coriolis effect is the reason that airlines' flight paths look
curved, even though they are the shortest possible path. Although these
flight paths show curves, what's wrong with this picture? (The curves do

#### Effect for Air or Water {#3.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0IGZvciBBaXIgb3IgV2F0ZXI._4-kcf}

As wind or an ocean current moves, the Earth spins underneath it. Wind
or water that travels toward the poles from the Equator curves to the
east. Wind or water that travels toward the Equator from the poles
curves to the west. The Coriolis effect bends the direction of surface
currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. The currents curve
left in the Southern Hemisphere ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PY2VhbkN1cnJlbnRz) ).

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-aju}

-   Earth rotates beneath freely moving objects like water and air.
    Compared with a spot on the planet, the objects appear to be moving.
-   Freely moving objects appear to move right in the
    Northern Hemisphere. They appear to move left in the
    Southern Hemisphere.
-   Coriolis is an effect rather than a force. Coriolis does not force
    a motion. An object appears to have a change of motion due to the
    Coriolis effect.

**Do you like the seasons?**

Do you live in a place with well-defined seasons? Do you appreciate the
change of the seasons? In other words, are you happy that Earth's axis
is tilted?

### Earth’s Seasons {#3.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIFNlYXNvbnM._5-wp3}

Some people think that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer and
farther away from the Sun in the the winter. But that's not true! Why
can't that be true? Because when it's summer in one hemisphere, it's
winter in the other. So what does cause the seasons? The seasons are
caused by the 23.5° tilt of Earth’s axis. One hemisphere points more
directly toward the Sun than the other hemisphere. As Earth orbits the
Sun, the tilt of Earth's axis stays lined up with the North Star.

**Solstice** refers to the position of the Sun when it is closest to one
of the poles. At equinox, the Sun is directly over the Equator.

#### Northern Hemisphere Summer {#3.html#x-ck12-Tm9ydGhlcm4gSGVtaXNwaGVyZSBTdW1tZXI._5-yb1}

During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted
toward the Sun. The Sun's rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more
directly ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtUmV2LTE1LU5vcnRoZXJuX1N1bW1lcg..) ). The
region gets a lot of sunlight. **Summer solstice** is June 21 or 22. At
that time, the Sun's rays hit directly at the Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N).
This is the farthest north that the Sun will be directly overhead.
Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is winter solstice in the
Southern Hemisphere.

</div>

#### Northern Hemisphere Winter {#3.html#x-ck12-Tm9ydGhlcm4gSGVtaXNwaGVyZSBXaW50ZXI._5-7gv}

**Winter solstice** for the Northern Hemisphere happens on December 21
or 22. The North Pole of Earth's axis points away from the Sun (
**Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtUmV2LTE1LU5vcnRoZXJuX1dpbnRlcg..) ).
Light from the Sun is spread out over a larger area. With fewer daylight
hours in winter, there is also less time for the Sun to warm the area.
When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the
Southern Hemisphere.

the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5°S). Sunlight is spread across a large area
near the South Pole. No sunlight reaches the North Pole.

. Notice the area of solar radiation, or insolation, in the lower right
of the screen.

#### Equinox {#3.html#x-ck12-RXF1aW5veA.._5-deh}

**Equinox** comes halfway between the two solstices. At equinoxes, the
Sun's rays shine most directly at the Equator ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE1MDMtMDg.) ). The daylight and
nighttime hours are exactly equal on an equinox. The autumnal, or fall,
equinox happens on September 22 or 23. The vernal, or spring, equinox
happens March 21 or 22 in the Northern Hemisphere.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-pai}

-   Earth has seasons because of the (23.5°) tilt of its axis
    of rotation.
-   In the Northern Hemisphere, at summer solstice the Sun is closest to
    the North Pole (around June 22). At winter solstice, the Sun is
    closest to the South Pole (around December 22). In the Southern
    Hemisphere, the names are changed.
-   At equinox, the Sun is directly over the Equator. Autumnal equinox
    is around September 22. Spring equinox is around March 22.

**What kind of revolution are we talking about?**

Copernicus caused a revolution. He said that Earth revolved around the
Sun. With his telescope, Galileo found a lot of evidence for this. He
could see moons orbiting Jupiter. If moons can orbit Jupiter, surely
Earth can orbit the Sun. Yes? In the two images above, you can see
Jupiter at two different times, showing moons in different places.

### Earth's Revolution {#3.html#x-ck12-RWFydGgncyBSZXZvbHV0aW9u_6-qsi}

Earth orbits a star. That star is our Sun. One **revolution** around the
Sun takes 365.24 days. That is equal to one year. Earth stays in orbit
around the Sun because of the Sun's gravity ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb2xhckVsbGlwc2Vz) ).

Earth's orbit is not a circle. It is a bit elliptical. So as we travel
around the Sun, sometimes we are a little farther away from the Sun.
Sometimes we are closer to the Sun.

Students sometimes think the slightly oval shape of our orbit causes
Earth's seasons. That's not true! The seasons are due to the tilt of
Earth’s axis, as discussed in the previous concept.

**Figure 3.14**

Earth and the other planets in the solar system make elliptical orbits
around the Sun. The ellipses in this image are highly exaggerated.

</div>

The distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 93 million miles, or
150 million kilometers. Earth revolves around the Sun at an average
speed of about 27 kilometers (17 miles) per second. Mercury and Venus
are closer to the Sun, so they take shorter times to make one orbit.
Mercury takes only about 88 Earth days to make one trip around the Sun.
All of the other planets take longer amounts of time. The exact amount
depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Saturn takes more than 29
Earth years to make one revolution around the Sun. How old would you be
if you were on Jupiter?

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-uxk}

**Can you see a solar eclipse?**

Of course! This photo of a partial solar eclipse was taken on May 20,
2012 in Gilbert, Arizona. The maximum was 82% at that location. Further
north people experienced totality. The next two eclipses in North
America will be a partial on October 23, 2014 and a total on August 21,
2017. If you try to view an eclipse, be sure you use eye protection!

### Solar Eclipses {#3.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgRWNsaXBzZXM._7-wjq}

When a new moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, it causes
a **solar eclipse** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMjEtU29sYXItZWNsaXBzZS1zY2hlbWF0aWM.)
). The Moon casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks our view of the Sun.
This only happens if all three are lined up and in the same plane. This
plane is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the plane of Earth’s orbit
around the Sun.

The Moon’s shadow has two distinct parts. The **umbra** is the inner,
cone-shaped part of the shadow. It is the part in which all of the light
has been blocked. The **penumbra** is the outer part of Moon’s shadow.
It is where the light is only partially blocked.

**Figure 3.15**

During a solar eclipse, the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth. The shadow
is made up of two parts: the darker umbra and the lighter penumbra.

</div>

When the Moon's shadow completely blocks the Sun, it is a total solar
eclipse ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ub3RhbFNvbGFyRWNsaXBzZQ..) ). If only
part of the Sun is out of view, it is a partial solar eclipse. Solar
eclipses are rare events. They usually only last a few minutes. That is
because the Moon’s shadow only covers a very small area on Earth, and
Earth is turning very rapidly.

Solar eclipses are amazing to experience. The light disappears so that
it's like night, only strange. Birds may sing as they do at dusk. Stars
become visible in the sky. It gets colder outside. Unlike at night,
though, the Sun is out. So during a solar eclipse, it's easy to see the
Sun's corona and solar prominences. This NASA page will inform you on
when solar eclipses are expected:

**Can you see a lunar eclipse?**

Again, of course! Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar
eclipse. The next four total lunar eclipses predicted for North America
will be on April 15, 2014, October 8, 2014, April 5, 2015, and September
28, 2015.

### Lunar Eclipses {#3.html#x-ck12-THVuYXIgRWNsaXBzZXM._8-daj}

Sometimes a full moon moves through Earth's shadow. This is a **lunar
eclipse** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjQtMjgtTHVuYXItZWNsaXBzZQ..) ). During a
total lunar eclipse, the Moon travels completely in Earth’s umbra.
During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters
Earth’s umbra. When the Moon passes through Earth’s penumbra, it is a
penumbral eclipse. Since Earth’s shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts
for hours.

**Can the Moon cast shadows?**

Of course! A full moon is very bright. It is bright enough to cast
shadows. If you are out away from city lights and the Moon is full you
might cast your own Moon shadow.

### The Phases of the Moon {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBoYXNlcyBvZiB0aGUgTW9vbg.._9-upl}

The Moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reflects light
from the Sun. The Moon has phases because it orbits around Earth. One
orbit takes about 28 days. As the moon moves around Earth, different
parts of it appear to be lit up by the Sun. The Moon sometimes appears
fully lit and sometimes completely dark. Sometimes it is partially lit.
The different appearances of the Moon are referred to as phases of the
Moon ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TW9vbl9waGFzZXNfaW1hZ2U.) ).

A **full moon** occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit. This
happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun.

![The phases of the
moon](ck12_3_files/20150911025626640360.jpeg "The phases of the moon")

**Figure 3.19**

The moon's phases are a result of the moon's orbit around Earth.

</div>

About one week later, the Moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half
of the Moon’s lit surface is visible from Earth, so it appears as a half
circle.

Another week later, the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun. The side
of the Moon facing Earth is completely dark. This is called a **new
moon** . Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new
moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the Earth
and hits the Moon.

One week after that, the Moon is in another quarter-moon phase. Finally,
in one more week, the Moon is back to full.

Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent
phases. During the **crescent** moon phase, the Moon is less than half
lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the
**gibbous** moon phase, the Moon is more than half lit. It is not full.
The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-agu}

-   The appearance of the Moon from Earth has distinct phases.
-   A full moon is completely lit; a new moon is completely dark.
-   A gibbous moon is more than half lit; a crescent moon is less than
    half lit.

**How deep can we go into Earth's interior?**

Not very deep, that's for sure! The deepest a drill hole has gotten was
the Kola Superdeep Borehole. That hole got to 40,230 feet (12,262 m),
about one-third of the way into the crust in that area. So learning
about what's deeper requires less direct methods. A few of these methods
will be described in this concept.

### Learning About Earth’s Interior {#3.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5pbmcgQWJvdXQgRWFydGjigJlzIEludGVyaW9y_10-oea}

If someone told you to figure out what is inside Earth, what would you
do? How could you figure out what is inside our planet? How do
scientists figure it out?

#### Seismic Waves {#3.html#x-ck12-U2Vpc21pYyBXYXZlcw.._10-jxx}

Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of
energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called
**seismic waves** ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMDE.)
). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They
change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This
causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or
gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to
understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.

#### Meteorites {#3.html#x-ck12-TWV0ZW9yaXRlcw.._10-kkm}

Scientists study **meteorites** to learn about Earth’s interior.
Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects represent
early solar system materials ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDYtMDQtTWV0ZW9yaXRl) ). Some meteorites
are made of iron and nickel. They are thought to be very similar to
Earth's core. An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the
core that scientists can hold in their hands!

**Figure 3.21**

This meteorite contains the mafic minerals olivine and pyroxene. It also

</div>

#### Density {#3.html#x-ck12-RGVuc2l0eQ.._10-wju}

Earth’s overall density is higher than the density of crustal rocks, so
the core must be made of something dense, like metal.

#### Magnetic Field {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0aWMgRmllbGQ._10-rhy}

Since Earth has a magnetic field, there must be metal within the planet.
Iron and nickel are both magnetic.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-lmc}

-   Different types of seismic waves behave differently in
    different materials. Their behavior can tell scientists about the
    material they travel through.
-   Earth must contain metal. Its density, and the fact that it has a
    magnetic field, require it.
-   Meteorites formed early in the solar system. They indicate something

**Does this look familiar?**

Gases, water, rock, and living organisms are all found at Earth's
surface. These materials are also found above or below the surface. They
interact with each other and in doing so alter each other. For example,
the hydrosphere may cause some of the lithosphere to wash away.

### Spheres {#3.html#x-ck12-U3BoZXJlcw.._11-xiy}

Earth is made of layers. Since Earth is round, the layers all have the
ending "-sphere" ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMDM.)
).

Some of the different parts of the Earth are the:

-   **Atmosphere** : The thin layer of air, mostly nitrogen and oxygen,
    that surrounds the Earth.
-   **Hydrosphere** : All the water on Earth.
-   **Biosphere** : All the living organisms on Earth.
-   **Lithosphere** : The solid rock part of Earth, including mountains,
    valleys, continents, and all of the rock beneath the oceans.

    is round.
-   Some of the layers are: atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere,
    and lithosphere.

**What's below our feet? What's way below?**

If we could cut Earth open, we'd see the following layers from inside to
outside: inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. Alternatively, you
can think of the brittle lithosphere riding on the plastic
asthenosphere. Whew!

### Layers by Composition {#3.html#x-ck12-TGF5ZXJzIGJ5IENvbXBvc2l0aW9u_12-pzu}

A cross section of Earth showing the following layers: (1) crust (2)
mantle (3a) outer core (3b) inner core (4) lithosphere (5) asthenosphere
(6) outer core (7) inner core.

</div>

Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition:

1.  The **crust** is less than 1% of Earth by mass. The two types are
    oceanic crust and continental crust.
2.  The **mantle** is hot, dense, dark (ultramafic) rock. It represents
    about 68% of Earth's mass.
3.  The **core** is mostly iron metal. The core makes up about 31% of
    the Earth. Earth's metallic core has two layers: a solid inner layer
    and a liquid outer layer.

The terms core, mantle, and crust will be described in more detail in
the next three concepts.

### Layers by Mechanical Properties {#3.html#x-ck12-TGF5ZXJzIGJ5IE1lY2hhbmljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcw.._12-bzg}

Lithosphere and asthenosphere are divisions based on mechanical
properties:

1.  The **lithosphere** is composed of both the crust and the
    uppermost mantle. The lithosphere is a brittle, rigid solid. It is
    easily cracked or broken.
2.  The **asthenosphere** is below the lithosphere. The asthenosphere is
    also in the upper mantle. This layer is solid, but it can flow
    and bend. A solid that can flow is like silly putty.

This animation shows the layers by composition and by mechanical
properties:
[http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t\_tectonics/p\_layers.html](p_layers.html)
.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-jou}

-   By composition, Earth is divided into core, mantle, and crust.
-   By mechanical properties, the crust and upper mantle are divided
    into lithosphere and asthenosphere.
-   The core-mantle-crust divisions are based on composition.
-   The lithosphere-asthensophere divisions are based on

**What do these two photos have in common?**

Both of these photos are of Earth's crust. The crust on the left is on
the continent. It's what you see and walk on every day. The crust on the
right is in the ocean. You may have seen pictures, but to see it in
person you need special equipment.

### Crust {#3.html#x-ck12-Q3J1c3Q._13-wcd}

Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition.
It's understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and
less about deeper layers. Earth’s **crust** is a thin, brittle outer
shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans
and much thicker in mountain ranges.

#### Oceanic Crust {#3.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5pYyBDcnVzdA.._13-vfj}

There are two kinds of crust. **Oceanic crust** is made of basalt lavas
that flow onto the seafloor ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DcnVzdGFsR2FiYnJv) ). It is relatively
thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the
oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm ^3^ ) than the rocks that make up the
continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor.

#### Continental Crust {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50YWwgQ3J1c3Q._13-cl8}

**Continental crust** is much thicker than oceanic crust. It is 35
kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies a lot. Continental
crust is made up of many different rocks ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DcnVzdGFsR3Jhbml0ZQ..) ). All three
major rock types—igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary—are found in the
crust. On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm ^3^ )
than oceanic crust. Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the
mantle than oceanic crust.

**What does mantle rock look like?**

You can't go to the mantle but small pieces of the mantle can come to
you. Kimberlite forms deep in the mantle and is erupted violently into
the crust. Kimberlite can contain diamonds. Most kimberlites reached the
surface much earlier in Earth history.

### Mantle {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFudGxl_14-jgh}

Beneath the crust is the **mantle** . The mantle is made of hot, solid
rock. They know this because of seismic waves, meteorites, and the heat
that comes from inside the planet. Mantle rock is mostly **peridotite**
, which is rich in iron and magnesium ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QZXJpZG90aXRl) ). Peridotite is rare
at Earth's surface.

The rock of the mantle is mostly peridotite. Peridotite is formed of
crystals of olivine (green) and pyroxene (black).

#### Heat Flow {#3.html#x-ck12-SGVhdCBGbG93_14-f9m}

Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to
cooler objects ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMDQ.) ).
The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. In

Hot lower mantle material rises upward ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMDU.) ). As it rises, it cools. At
the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool
and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it
travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where
warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and
cooler material is called **convection** .

**Is this what the core looks like?**

Yes! The outer core, anyway. The outer core is liquid metal, like in
this photo. Of course, the metal is under an incredible amount of
pressure.

### Core {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29yZQ.._15-4jx}

The dense, iron **core** forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know
that the core is metal. The inner core is solid, and the outer core is
molten. Here are some of the reasons they know this:

-   Metallic meteorites are thought to be from the same type of material
    that is found at the core ( **Figure**

-   Scientists calculate Earth's density from the planet's rotation. To
    match the total density, the inner layers must be denser than the
    outer layers. They must be as dense as metal.

-   Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid. The inner core
    is solid.

-   For there to be a magnetic field, there must be liquid metal. The
    metal must be convecting. If the core did not have convecting metal,
    there would be no magnetic field.

## Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-0nb}

This Concept deals with some Earth basics. Earth is a planet and has the
characteristics of a planet. Like other planets, it is nearly round.
This is because it has enough mass for its gravity to pull material into
a round shape. Earth's gravity has also pulled in small objects, like
asteroids. So the planet's orbit is cleared. Earth rotates on its axis
and revolves around its star. As a result of its rotation, Earth has a
day-night cycle. The tilt of its axis creates the seasons. Earth has
layers from crust to mantle to core. The core is divided into a liquid
outer core and a solid inner core. The liquid outer core has convection,
which generates the magnetic field. The mantle is solid rock. The crust
has two major types: continental and oceanic. The crust and uppermost
mantle make up the lithosphere. Beneath the lithosphere is the
asthenosphere. The lithosphere is brittle and will break. The
asthenosphere can flow.

**How can you learn about Earth's crust?**

Well, you could travel around and visit Earth's crust in lots of places.
You would see different minerals and rocks everywhere you went. You
would learn that certain rocks indicate that certain processes happened.
For example, the rock basalt means that there was a volcanic eruption
nearby. Since it may not be practical to take such a big trip, where
else could you see materials from Earth's crust? A museum is a great
place! The next time you're in a major city, find a way to spend a few
hours in a natural history museum. In this Concept, we'll learn about a
variety of Earth materials.

**Can you see matter?**

Matter is all around you. Everything you see is matter. All of this
matter is made of small particles. The small particles are made of
smaller particles.

### What is Matter? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBNYXR0ZXI_-epc}

To understand minerals, we must first understand matter. **Matter** is
the substance that physical objects are made of.

#### Atoms and Elements {#4.html#x-ck12-QXRvbXMgYW5kIEVsZW1lbnRz-i6x}

The basic unit of matter is an **atom** ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BdG9tSWxsdXN0cmF0aW9u) ). At the
center of an atom is its **nucleus** . **Protons** are positively
charged particles in the nucleus. Also in the nucleus are **neutrons**
with no electrical charge. Orbiting the nucleus are tiny electrons.
**Electrons** are negatively charged. An atom with the same number of
protons and electrons is electrically neutral. If the atom has more or
less electrons to protons it is called an **ion** . An ion will have
positive charge if it has more protons than electrons. It will have
negative charge if it has more electrons than protons.

**Figure 4.1**

The nucleus of an atom is made up of protons (blue) and neutrons
(yellow). Electrons (red) orbit around the nucleus.

</div>

An atom is the smallest unit of a chemical **element** . That is, an
atom has all the properties of that element. All atoms of the same
element have the same number of protons.

#### Molecules and Compounds {#4.html#x-ck12-TW9sZWN1bGVzIGFuZCBDb21wb3VuZHM.-o7v}

A **molecule** is the smallest unit of a **chemical compound** . A
compound is a substance made of two or more elements. The elements in a
chemical compound are always present in a certain ratio.

Water is probably one of the simplest compounds that you know. A water
molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTAzMDEtMDM.) ). All water molecules have
the same ratio: two hydrogen ions to one oxygen ion.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-spz}

-   An atom has negatively-charged electrons in orbit around
    its nucleus.
-   The nucleus of an atom is composed of positively-charged protons,
    and neutrons, which have no charge.
-   An atom that gains or loses electrons is an ion.

**Are you a mineral?**

There used to be a TV commercial that said "you are what you eat." If
that's true, then you are partly the mineral halite. That's just table
salt, after all.

### What is a Mineral? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIE1pbmVyYWw__1-had}

A **mineral** is a solid material that forms by a natural process. A
mineral can be made of an element or a compound. It has a specific
chemical composition. Its chemical composition is different from other
minerals. Each type of mineral has physical properties that differ from
others. These properties include crystal structure, hardness, density,
and color. For example, silver is a soft, shiny metal. Salt is a white,
cube-shaped crystal. Diamond is an extremely hard, translucent crystal.

#### Forms by Natural Processes {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybXMgYnkgTmF0dXJhbCBQcm9jZXNzZXM._1-v6o}

Minerals form by natural processes. Minerals are created by processes
that happen in or on the Earth. For example, when hot lava cools,
mineral crystals form. Minerals also precipitate from water. Some
minerals grow when rocks are exposed to high pressures and temperatures.

Could a mineral be made by a process that was not natural? People make
gemstones in a laboratory. Synthetic diamond is a common one. But that
stone is not a mineral. That's because a mineral must be created by
natural processes. This is part of the definition of a mineral.

#### Inorganic Substance {#4.html#x-ck12-SW5vcmdhbmljIFN1YnN0YW5jZQ.._1-8xn}

A mineral is an inorganic substance. It was not made by living
organisms. Organic substances contain carbon. Some types of organic
substances are proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. Everything else is
inorganic. In a few cases, living organisms make inorganic materials.
The calcium carbonate shells made by marine animals are inorganic.

#### Definite Composition {#4.html#x-ck12-RGVmaW5pdGUgQ29tcG9zaXRpb24._1-vw5}

All minerals have a definite chemical makeup. A few minerals are made of
only one kind of element. Silver is a mineral made only of silver atoms.
Diamond and graphite are both made only of the element carbon.

Minerals that are not just a single element are made of chemical
compounds. For example, the mineral quartz is made of the compound
silicon dioxide, or SiO ~2~ . This compound has one atom of the element
silicon for every two atoms of the element oxygen.

Each mineral has its own unique chemical formula. For example, the
mineral hematite has two iron atoms for every three oxygen atoms. The
mineral magnetite has three iron atoms for every four oxygen atoms. Many
minerals have very complex chemical formulas that include several
elements. However, even in more complicated compounds, the elements
occur in definite ratios.

#### Solid Crystals {#4.html#x-ck12-U29saWQgQ3J5c3RhbHM._1-tbh}

Minerals must be solid. For example, ice and water have the same
chemical composition. Ice is a solid, so it is a mineral. Water is a
liquid, so it is not a mineral.

Some solids are not crystals. Glass, or the rock obsidian, are solid.
However, they are not crystals. In a **crystal** , the atoms are
arranged in a pattern. This pattern is regular and it repeats. The image
below shows how the atoms are arranged in halite (table salt) (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTAxMDMtMDI.) ). Halite
contains atoms of sodium and chlorine in a pattern. Notice that the
pattern goes in all three dimensions.

**Figure 4.3**

Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chloride ions (green balls) to form
halite crystals.

</div>

The pattern of atoms in all halite is the same. Think about all of the
grains of salt that are in a salt shaker. The atoms are arranged in the
same way in every piece of salt.

Sometimes two different minerals have the same chemical composition. But
they are different minerals because they have different crystal
structures. Diamonds are very valuable as gemstones because they are
very pretty and very hard. Graphite is the “lead” in pencils. It's not
hard at all! Amazingly, both are made just of carbon. Compare the
diamond with the pencil lead ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMy1DYXJib25fY29tcG9zaXRl) ). Why are they
so different? The carbon atoms in graphite bond to form layers. The
bonds between each layer are weak. The carbon sheets can just slip past
each other. The carbon atoms in diamonds bond together in all three
directions. This strong network makes diamonds very hard.

#### Physical Properties {#4.html#x-ck12-UGh5c2ljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcw.._1-j2n}

The patterns of atoms affect a mineral's physical properties. A
mineral's crystal shape is determined by the way the atoms are arranged.
For example, you can see how atoms are arranged in halite ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTAxMDMtMDI.) ). Below, you can see how
salt crystals look under a microscope ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDMtVGFibGVfU2FsdA..) ). Salt crystals
are all cubes whether they're small or large.

**What would you do with this mineral?**

Imagine you are in charge of organizing more than 100 minerals for a
museum exhibit. You know that people learn more if they see the minerals
together in groups. So how would you group the minerals together in the
exhibit? What are some of the possibilities? Size? Shape? Color?

### Mineral Groups {#4.html#x-ck12-TWluZXJhbCBHcm91cHM._2-yl2}

**Mineralogists** are scientists who study minerals. They divide
minerals into groups based on chemical composition. Even though there
are over 4,000 minerals, most minerals fit into one of eight mineral
groups.

#### Silicate Minerals {#4.html#x-ck12-U2lsaWNhdGUgTWluZXJhbHM._2-tjw}

Silicates are the largest mineral group. About 1,000 silicate minerals
are known. Silicate minerals are also extremely common. They make up
over 90% of Earth's crust!

**Silicates** contain silicon atoms and oxygen atoms. One silicon atom
is bonded to four oxygen atoms. These atoms form a tetrahedron (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTAzLTAxLTA2) ). The silica
tetrahedron is the building block of silicate minerals. Most silicates
contain other elements. These elements include calcium, iron, and
magnesium.

**Figure 4.6**

</div>

Silicate minerals are divided into six smaller groups. In each group,
the silicate pyramids join together differently. The pyramids can stand
alone. They can form into connected circles called rings. Some pyramids
link into single and double chains. Others form large, flat sheets. Some
join in three dimensions.

Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicates. In beryl, the
silicate pyramids join together as rings. Biotite is mica. The silicate
pyramids come together to create thin, flexible sheets. Compare the
beryl and the biotite pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDMtU2lsaWNhdGVfY29tcG9zaXRl) ).

#### Native Elements {#4.html#x-ck12-TmF0aXZlIEVsZW1lbnRz_2-2pb}

**Native elements** contain only atoms of one type of element. They are
not combined with other elements. There are very few examples of these
types of minerals. Some native elements are rare and valuable. Gold,
silver, sulfur, and diamond are examples.

#### Carbonates {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uYXRlcw.._2-k67}

What do you guess **carbonate** minerals contain? If you guessed carbon,
you would be right! All carbonates contain one carbon atom bonded to
three oxygen atoms. Carbonates may include other elements. A few of
these are calcium, iron, and copper.

Carbonate minerals are often found where seas once covered the land.
Some carbonate minerals are very common. Calcite contains calcium,
carbon, and oxygen. Have you ever been in a limestone cave or seen a
marble tile? Calcite is in both limestone and marble. Azurite and
malachite are also carbonate minerals. They contain copper instead of
calcium. They are not as common as calcite. Malachite and azurite are
used in jewelry; as you can see, they are very colorful ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BenVyaXRlQW5kUmhvZG9jaHJvc2l0ZQ..) ).

#### Halides {#4.html#x-ck12-SGFsaWRlcw.._2-pyo}

Halide minerals are salts. They form when salt water evaporates. This
mineral class includes more than just table salt. Halide minerals may
contain the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Some halide
minerals combine with metal elements. Common table salt is a halide
mineral that contains the elements chlorine and sodium. Fluorite is a
type of halide that contains fluorine and calcium. Fluorite can be found
in many colors. If you shine an ultraviolet light on fluorite, it will
glow!

#### Oxides {#4.html#x-ck12-T3hpZGVz_2-6wm}

Earth’s crust contains a lot of oxygen. The oxygen can combine with
other elements to create oxide minerals. **Oxides** contain one or two
metal elements combined with oxygen. Oxides are different from
silicates, because they do not contain silicon. Many important metals
are found as oxides. For example, hematite and magnetite are both oxides
that contain iron. Hematite (Fe ~2~ O ~3~ ) has a ratio of two iron
atoms to three oxygen atoms. Magnetite (Fe ~3~ O ~4~ ) has a ratio of
three iron atoms to four oxygen atoms. Notice that the word “magnetite”
contains the word “magnet." Magnetite ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDMtMDItMTMtTWFnbmV0aXRl) ) is a magnetic
mineral.

Magnetite is one of the most distinctive oxides since it is magnetic.

</div>

#### Phosphates {#4.html#x-ck12-UGhvc3BoYXRlcw.._2-qnv}

Phosphate minerals have a structure similar to silicates. In silicates,
an atom of silicon is bonded to oxygen. In **phosphates** , an atom of
phosphorus, arsenic, or vanadium is bonded to oxygen. There are many
types of phosphate minerals, but phosphate minerals are rare. The
composition of phosphates is complex. For example, turquoise contains
copper, aluminum, and phosphorus ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy0zLTMtVHVycXVvaXNl) ).

is not as rare as some minerals and is commonly used for jewelry.

</div>

#### Sulfates {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VsZmF0ZXM._2-nq6}

**Sulfate** minerals contain sulfur atoms bonded to oxygen atoms. Like
halides, they can form in places where salt water evaporates. Many
minerals belong in the sulfate group, but there are only a few common
sulfate minerals. Gypsum is a common sulfate mineral that contains
calcium, sulfate, and water. Gypsum is found in various forms. For
example, it can be pink and look like it has flower petals. However, it
can also grow into very large white crystals. Gypsum crystals that are
11-meters-long have been found. That is about as long as a school bus!
Gypsum forms at the Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HeXBzdW1JbkhvdFNwcmluZ3M.)
).

#### Sulfides {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VsZmlkZXM._2-k2y}

**Sulfides** contain metal elements combined with sulfur. Sulfides are
different from sulfates. They do not contain oxygen. Pyrite is a common
sulfide mineral ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy0zLTMtUHlyaXRl) ). It contains iron
combined with sulfur. Pyrite is also known as “fool’s gold.” Gold miners
have mistaken pyrite for gold because pyrite has a greenish gold color.

**How do you identify a mineral?**

You're in a competition getting ready to go onstage. You discover that
you forgot your shirt! You call your mom and ask her (nicely) to bring
it to you right away. But first you need to let her know which shirt it
is. What would you tell her? You might describe the color, the way the
fabric feels, and the length of the sleeves. These are all physical
properties of your shirt. If you do a good job describing the shirt your
mom will bring the right one. Minerals also have physical properties
that are used to identify them.

### How are Minerals Identified? {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IGFyZSBNaW5lcmFscyBJZGVudGlmaWVkPw.._3-qtm}

Imagine you were given a mineral sample similar to the pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmVlbkFjdGlub2xpdGU.) ).
You can use a mineral’s properties to identify what type it is. How
would you try to identify your mineral? You can observe some properties
by looking at the mineral. For example, you can see that its color is
green. The mineral has a needle-like, fibrous structure. But you can't
see all mineral properties. You need to do simple tests to determine
some properties. One common one is how hard the mineral is. The
mineral’s physical properties are determined by its chemical composition
and crystal structure.

#### Color, Streak, and Luster {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29sb3IsIFN0cmVhaywgYW5kIEx1c3Rlcg.._3-y1c}

Diamonds have many valuable properties. Diamonds are translucent and
extremely hard. The most valuable diamonds are large, well-shaped and
sparkly. Some are not as pretty and are used for industrial purposes.
Turquoise is another mineral that is used in jewelry because of its
striking greenish-blue color. Many minerals have interesting
appearances. Specific terms are used to describe the appearance of
minerals.

#### Color {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29sb3I._3-jur}

Color is probably the easiest property to observe. Unfortunately, you
can rarely identify a mineral only by its color. Sometimes, different
minerals are the same color. For example, you might find a mineral that
is a golden color and think it is gold. But it might actually be pyrite,
or “fool's gold,” which is made of iron and sulfide. It contains no gold
atoms.

A certain mineral may form in different colors. For example, pictured
below are four samples of quartz ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1RdWFydHpWYXJpZXRpZXM.) shows),
including one that is colorless and one that is purple. The purple color
comes from a tiny amount of iron. Iron is not normally found in quartz.
When it is, it is a chemical impurity. Many minerals are colored by
chemical impurities. Other factors can also affect a mineral’s color.
Weathering changes the surface of a mineral. Because color alone is
unreliable, geologists rarely identify a mineral just on its color. To
identify most minerals, they use several properties.

#### Streak {#4.html#x-ck12-U3RyZWFr_3-xaf}

**Streak** is the color of the powder of a mineral. To do a streak test,
you scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate. The plate is
harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of
powder on the plate. The color of the streak often differs from the
color of the larger mineral sample ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaW5lcmFsU3RyZWFrUGxhdGU.) ).
Yellow-gold pyrite has a blackish streak. This blackish streak tells you
that the mineral is not gold, because gold has a gold-colored streak.

Hematite has a reddish-brown streak.

</div>

Streak is more reliable than color to identify minerals. Different
minerals that are the same color may have a different color streak. For
example, samples of hematite and galena are both dark gray. They can be
told apart because hematite has a red streak and galena has a gray
streak.

#### Luster {#4.html#x-ck12-THVzdGVy_3-au3}

**Luster** describes the way light reflects off of the surface of the
mineral. You might describe diamonds as sparkly or pyrite as shiny. But
mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. They first divide
minerals into metallic and non-metallic luster. Minerals that are opaque
and shiny, like pyrite, are said to have a “metallic” luster. Minerals
with a “non-metallic” luster do not look like metals. There are many
types of non-metallic luster. Six are described below ( **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6bWluZXJhbHNfbm9ubWV0YWxsaWM.) ).

  **Non-Metallic Luster**   **Appearance**
  ------------------------- -------------------------------
  Adamantine                Sparkly
  Earthy                    Dull, clay-like
  Pearly                    Pearl-like
  Resinous                  Like resins, such as tree sap
  Silky                     Soft-looking with long fibers
  Vitreous                  Glassy

Can you match the minerals ( **Figure**

#### Density {#4.html#x-ck12-RGVuc2l0eQ.._3-eov}

You are going to visit a friend. You fill one backpack with books so you
can study later. You stuff your pillow into another backpack that is the
same size. Which backpack will be easier to carry? Even though the
backpacks are the same size, the bag that contains your books is going
to be much heavier. It has a greater density than the backpack with your
pillow.

**Density** describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space.
Substances that have more matter packed into a given space have higher
densities. The water in a drinking glass has the same density as the
water in a bathtub or swimming pool. All substances have characteristic
densities, which does not depend on how much of a substance you have.

Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of
space an object takes up is described by its volume. The density of an
object depends on its mass and its volume. Density can be calculated
using the following equation:

![\\text{Density}\\; =\\;
\\text{Mass}/\\text{Volume}](ck12_math_images_dir/9e616a18cd4ac8d96732d40a53451c14.png)

Samples that are the same size but have different densities, will have
different masses. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm ^3^ . Pyrite has a
density of only about 5 g/cm ^3^ . Quartz is even less dense than pyrite
and has a density of 2.7 g/cm ^3^ . If you picked up a piece of pyrite
and a piece of quartz that were the same size, the pyrite would seem
almost twice as heavy as the quartz.

Specific gravity is used to identify minerals. **Specific gravity**
measures how heavy the mineral is relative to the same volume of water.

#### Hardness {#4.html#x-ck12-SGFyZG5lc3M._3-d2j}

**Hardness** is a mineral’s ability to resist being scratched. Minerals
that are not easily scratched are hard. You test the hardness of a
mineral by scratching its surface with a mineral of a known hardness.
Mineralogists use the Mohs Hardness Scale ( **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TW9oc19TY2FsZQ..) ), as a reference for
mineral hardness. The scale lists common minerals in order of their
relative hardness. You can use the minerals in the scale to test the
hardness of an unknown mineral.

#### Mohs Hardness Scale {#4.html#x-ck12-TW9ocyBIYXJkbmVzcyBTY2FsZQ.._3-1te}

As you can see, diamond is a 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. Diamond is
the hardest mineral; no other mineral can scratch a diamond. Quartz is a
7. It can be scratched by topaz, corundum, and diamond. Quartz will
scratch minerals that have a lower number on the scale. Fluorite is one.
Suppose you had a piece of pure gold. You find that calcite scratches
the gold. Gypsum does not. Gypsum has a hardness of 2 and calcite is a
3. That means the hardness of gold is between gypsum and calcite. So the
hardness of gold is about 2.5 on the scale. A hardness of 2.5 means that
gold is a relatively soft mineral. It is only about as hard as your
fingernail.

#### Cleavage and Fracture {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2xlYXZhZ2UgYW5kIEZyYWN0dXJl_3-1is}

Different types of minerals break apart in their own way. Remember that
all minerals are crystals. This means that the atoms in a mineral are
arranged in a repeating pattern. This pattern determines how a mineral
will break. When you break a mineral, you break chemical bonds. Because
of the way the atoms are arranged, some bonds are weaker than other
bonds. A mineral is more likely to break where the bonds between the
atoms are weaker.

#### Cleavage {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2xlYXZhZ2U._3-sfl}

**Cleavage** is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes.
When a mineral breaks along a plane, it makes a smooth surface. Minerals
with different crystal structures will break or cleave in different ways
( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DbGVhdmFnZUNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) ). Halite
tends to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica tends to form sheets.
Fluorite can form octahedrons.

Minerals can form various shapes. Polygons are pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaW5lcmFsU3RydWN0dXJlcw..)
). The shapes form as the minerals are broken along their cleavage
planes. Cleavage planes determine how the crystals can be cut to make
smooth surfaces. People who cut gemstones follow cleavage planes.
Diamonds and emeralds can be cut to make beautiful gemstones.

</div>

#### Fracture {#4.html#x-ck12-RnJhY3R1cmU._3-w0l}

**Fracture** describes how a mineral breaks without any pattern. A
fracture is uneven. The surface is not smooth and flat. You can learn
about a mineral from the way it fractures. If a mineral splinters like
wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, fracture to form
smooth, curved surfaces. Pictured below is a mineral that broke forming
a smooth, curved surface ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PYnNpZGlhbkNsZWF2YWdl) ).

#### Other Identifying Characteristics {#4.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgSWRlbnRpZnlpbmcgQ2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNz_3-o4r}

Minerals have other properties that can be used for identification. For
example, a mineral’s shape may indicate its crystal structure. Sometimes
crystals are too small to see. Then a mineralogist may use a special
instrument to find the crystal structure.

Some minerals have unique properties. These can be used to the minerals.
Listed below are some of these properties ( **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U3BlY2lhbF9NaW5fUHJvcA..) ); an example
of a mineral that has each property is also listed.

  Radioactivity   Mineral gives off radiation that can be measured with Geiger counter   Uraninite
  Reactivity      Bubbles form when mineral is exposed to a weak acid                    Calcite
  Smell           Some minerals have a distinctive smell                                 Sulfur (smells like rotten eggs)

**Can you watch minerals forming?**

Sure! Some kids get crystal growing kits. They mix up a solution and
evaporate off the water. Mineral crystals are left behind. This is
similar to the way halite and some other minerals form. These minerals
evaporate from salt water.

### Mineral Formation {#4.html#x-ck12-TWluZXJhbCBGb3JtYXRpb24._4-lbz}

Minerals form in a variety of ways. Some minerals form from very hot
fluids. Some form from cool fluids. Some form when solid minerals
rearrange.

#### Formation from Magma and Lava {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIGZyb20gTWFnbWEgYW5kIExhdmE._4-2xc}

You are on vacation at the beach. You take your flip-flops off so you
can go swimming. The sand is so hot it hurts your feet. You have to run
to the water. Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt.

Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts. Melted rock inside
the Earth is called magma. **Magma** can be hotter than 1,000 ^o^ C.
When magma erupts onto Earth’s surface, it is known as **lava** (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Mb3dTaWxpY2FMYXZh) ).
Minerals form when magma and lava cool. Some minerals crystallize at
hotter temperatures. These minerals form first. Other minerals form at
cooler temperatures. These minerals form later.

#### Formation from Solutions {#4.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIGZyb20gU29sdXRpb25z_4-wrs}

Most water on Earth, like the water in the oceans, contains elements.
The elements are mixed evenly through the water. Water plus other
substances makes a solution. The particles are so small that they will
not come out when you filter the water. But the elements in water can
form solid mineral deposits.

#### Minerals from Salt Water {#4.html#x-ck12-TWluZXJhbHMgZnJvbSBTYWx0IFdhdGVy_4-dgp}

Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements. Salt water
contains many more dissolved elements. Water can only hold a certain
amount of dissolved substances. When the water evaporates, it leaves
behind a solid layer of minerals ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTAzMDMtMDQ.) ). At this time, the
particles come together to form minerals. These solids sink to the
bottom. The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved
in the water. Seawater is salty enough for minerals to precipitate as
solids. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utah's Great
Salt Lake, can also precipitate salts.

Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Nb25vTGFrZVR1ZmE.) ). The limestone
towers pictured below are made mostly of the mineral calcite. The
calcite was deposited in the salty and alkaline water of Mono Lake, in
California. Calcium-rich spring water enters the bottom of the lake. The
water bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The calcite “tufa” towers form.
When the lake level drops, the tufa towers are revealed.

#### Minerals from Hot Underground Water {#4.html#x-ck12-TWluZXJhbHMgZnJvbSBIb3QgVW5kZXJncm91bmQgV2F0ZXI._4-ycb}

Underground water can be heated by magma. The hot water moves through
cracks below Earth’s surface. Hot water can hold more dissolved
particles than cold water. The hot, salty solution has chemical
reactions with the rocks around it. The water picks up more dissolved
particles. As it flows through open spaces in rocks, the water deposits
solid minerals. When a mineral fills cracks in rocks, the deposits are
called **veins** . Pictured below is a white quartz vein ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1RdWFydHpDb21wb3NpdGU.) ). When the
minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow. These rocks
are called geodes. Pictured below is a *geode* that was formed when
amethyst crystals grew in an open space in a rock ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1RdWFydHpDb21wb3NpdGU.) ).

**Will this rock be there forever?**

Rocks may seem permanent, but they're not. Over time a rock will change
into another type of rock. How this happens is known as the **rock
cycle** . There are three main types of rocks. There are several
processes that can change one type into another. First we need to learn
what the rocks types and processes are.

### What is a Rock? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIFJvY2s__5-ots}

A **rock** is a naturally formed, non-living Earth material. Rocks are
made of minerals. The minerals may be so tiny that you can only see them
with a microscope. The minerals may be really large. A rock may be made
of only one type of mineral. More often rocks are made of a mixture of
different minerals. A few types of rocks are made from materials that
are not minerals. For example, coal is organic so it is not a mineral,
nor is it made of minerals. Yet coal is a rock.

\(A) Granite has large crystals because it cools slowly. (B) Basalt has
very small crystals because it cools quickly. (C) Coal is made up of

</div>

Rocks are named for the combinations of minerals they are made of and
the ways those minerals came together. Remember that different minerals
form under different environmental conditions. So the minerals in a rock
contain clues about the conditions in which the rock formed ( **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Sb2NrQ29tcG9zaXRl) ).

### Rock Types {#4.html#x-ck12-Um9jayBUeXBlcw.._5-ldo}

Geologists group rocks based on how they form. There are three major
rock types. Each will be described in more detail in the coming
concepts.

-   **Igneous rocks** form when magma cools below Earth’s surface or
    lava cools at the surface.

<!-- -->

-   **Sedimentary rocks** form when sediments are compacted and
    cemented together. **Sediments** are pieces of rock. They may be
    gravel, sand, silt, or clay. Some sedimentary rocks form the solid
    minerals left behind after a liquid evaporates.

<!-- -->

-   **Metamorphic rocks** form when an existing rock is changed by heat
    or pressure. The minerals in the rock change but do not melt. The
    rock experiences these changes within the Earth.

Rocks can change from one type to another. The rock cycle describes how
this happens.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-c1x}

-   Nearly all rocks are made of minerals. A few are made of materials
    that do not fit the definition of minerals.
-   Igneous rocks form from cooled magma or lava.
-   Metamorphic rocks form as an existing rock is altered by high
    temperature or pressure.
-   Sedimentary rocks form from sediments that are cemented
    and compacted.

**Have you seen igneous rocks in the field?**

Igneous rocks are everywhere! One of the most common igneous rocks that
make up the crust is granite. Many mountain ranges are made of granite.
The spectacular features of Yosemite Valley, like Half Dome, are
granitic. Volcanoes are made of igneous rocks, such as basalt. Igneous
rocks are also found where you can't see them. Oceanic crust is mostly
basalt and gabbro. The mantle is peridotite.

### Igneous Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-SWduZW91cyBSb2Nrcw.._6-wkh}

Igneous rocks form when **magma** cools and forms crystals. Magma is
melted rock. What an igneous rock looks like is determined by two
things. One is the composition of the magma. The other is how fast the
magma cools. The rate of cooling determines the texture of the rock.

#### Composition {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG9zaXRpb24._6-sfz}

Different igneous rocks contain minerals with different compositions.
**Mafic** igneous rocks contain mafic minerals. Mafic minerals are dense
and dark in color. They typically contain iron and magnesium; they are
low in silica. Olivine and pyroxene are mafic minerals.

**Figure 4.25**

Olivine is the green mineral, pyroxene is the black mineral.

</div>

**Felsic** igneous rocks contain felsic minerals. They typically contain
aluminum and sodium; they are high in silica. Quartz and potassium
feldspar are felsic minerals. Minerals and rocks with a composition in
between mafic and felsic are called intermediate.

**Are these both igneous rocks?**

These rocks don't even look like they're the same type! They are, at
least in the same way that fish and mice are both vertebrates. They both
cooled from magma, but the similarities end there. Can you tell what's
different?

### Cooling {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29vbGluZw.._7-cbz}

Igneous rocks cool from magma. The appearance of the rock is created by
the composition of the magma. It is also determined by the rate that the
magma cools. If the magma cools deep underground, it cools slowly. If
the magma cools at or very near the surface, it cools quickly. This
results in two different rock types. The rock types can be told apart by
the size of their crystals. The size of the crystals creates the texture
of the rock.

#### Intrusive Igneous Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-SW50cnVzaXZlIElnbmVvdXMgUm9ja3M._7-7hv}

**Intrusive** igneous rocks cool underground. Deep in the crust, magma
cools slowly. Slow cooling gives crystals a chance to grow. Intrusive
igneous rocks have relatively large crystals that are easy to see.
Intrusive igneous rocks are also called plutonic. A **pluton** is an
igneous rock body that forms within the crust.

Granite is the most common intrusive igneous rock. Pictured below are
four types of intrusive rocks ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JZ25lb3VzUm9ja0NvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) ).

#### Extrusive Igneous Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-RXh0cnVzaXZlIElnbmVvdXMgUm9ja3M._7-ntu}

**Extrusive** igneous rocks form above the surface. The lava cools
quickly as it pours out onto the surface ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FeHRydXNpdmVJZ25lb3VzQ29tcG9zaXRl) ).
Extrusive igneous rocks cool much more rapidly than intrusive rocks. The
rapid cooling time does not allow time for large crystals to form. So
igneous extrusive rocks have smaller crystals than igneous intrusive
rocks. Extrusive igneous rocks are also called **volcanic rocks** .

Some extrusive igneous rocks cool so rapidly that crystals do not
develop at all. These form a glass, such as obsidian. Others, such as
pumice, contain holes where gas bubbles were trapped in the lava. The
holes make pumice so light that it actually floats in water. The most
common extrusive igneous rock is basalt. It is the rock that makes up
the ocean floor. Shown below are three types of extrusive igneous rocks

**Is this igneous rock intrusive or extrusive?**

You can't really tell from this view. A close up view would show small
crystals in a dark colored rock. This indicates rapid cooling from a
basalt lava. The most interesting feature you can see are the hexagonal
"posts." For them to form, cooling must not have been too rapid. This
amazing feature is Devil's Tower in Wyoming.

### Igneous Rock Classification {#4.html#x-ck12-SWduZW91cyBSb2NrIENsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u_8-nzw}

Igneous rocks are classified by composition and texture. The composition
can be felsic, intermediate, mafic, or ultramafic. The composition
depends on the minerals the rock includes. A felsic rock will contain
felsic minerals.

The mineral compositions are listed in the **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6aWduZW91c19wcm9wZXJ0aWVz) . The table
includes examples of minerals.

  **Composition**   **Color**      **Density**    **Minerals**
  ----------------- -------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------
  Felsic            Light          Low            Quartz, orthoclase feldspar
  Intermediate      Intermediate   Intermediate   Plagioclase feldspar, biotite, amphibole
  Mafic             Dark           High           Olivine, pyroxene
  Ultramafic        Very dark      Very high      Olivine

Texture indicates how the magma cooled. Magma that cools rapidly has
small or no visible crystals. Magma that cools slowly has large
crystals; reference the **Table**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6aWduZW91c19wcm9wZXJ0aWVz) for the type of
rock, the amount of silica it has, and examples.

first pair is two rocks that formed from a felsic magma. The rhyolite
cooled rapidly, and the granite cooled slowly. The second pair is two
rocks that formed from mafic magma. The basalt cooled rapidly, and the
gabbro cooled slowly. The color of the rocks and sizes of the crystals
are your clues. There are other rock pairs that you could find listed

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-xhb}

-   Igneous rocks are classified first by composition. Categories go
    from from felsic to ultramafic. Color can indicate composition.
-   Texture is second when classifying igneous rocks. Texture indicates
    how a rock cooled.
-   Igneous rocks are categorized in pairs. The two rocks in a pair have
    the same composition but different textures: gabbro-basalt,
    diorite-andesite, and granite-rhyolite.

**Where can you go to see sediments?**

Sediments are everywhere! One of the most fun places to see sediments is
on a beach. Squishing sand between your toes is a great way to
experience sediments first hand (or foot).

### Sedimentary Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-U2VkaW1lbnRhcnkgUm9ja3M._9-tm3}

Most sedimentary rocks form from sediments. The sediments must be packed
together to form a rock. Sedimentary rocks also form as minerals
precipitate from saline water. Sedimentary rock formation is described
in the next concept.

#### Sediments {#4.html#x-ck12-U2VkaW1lbnRz_9-ewu}

**Sediments** are small fragments of rocks and minerals. Pebbles, sand,
silt, and clay are examples of sediments. Sedimentary rocks may include
fossils. **Fossils** are materials left behind by once-living organisms.
Fossils can be pieces of the organism, like bones. They can also be
traces of the organism, like footprints.

#### Transport {#4.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNwb3J0_9-gyc}

Sediments are transported by water, wind, ice, or gravity. These agents
move them from the place where they formed. The sediments are then
deposited in a location.

#### Deposition {#4.html#x-ck12-RGVwb3NpdGlvbg.._9-rfj}

Sediments will eventually settle out of water ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1CZWFjaFNlZGltZW50cw..) ). For example,
rivers carry lots of sediment. Where the water slows, it dumps these
sediments along its banks, into lakes and the ocean.

**Figure 4.33**

Cobbles, pebbles, and sands are the sediments that are seen on this
beach.

</div>

When sediments settle out of water, they form horizontal layers. A layer
of sediment is deposited. Then the next layer is deposited on top of
that layer. So each layer in a sedimentary rock is younger than the
layer under it ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmFuZENhbnlvblN0cmF0YQ..) ).

**Figure 4.34**

The rock layers at the Grand Canyon are horizontal. We know that layers
at the bottom are older than layers at the top.

</div>

Sediments are deposited in many different types of environments. Beaches
and deserts collect large deposits of sand. Sediments also end up at the
bottom of the ocean and in lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and swamps.
Avalanches produce large piles of sediment. The environment where the
sediments are deposited determines the type of sedimentary rock that can
form.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-x4r}

-   Sediments range in size from tiny bits of silt or clay to

**What steps led to this rock formation?**

What do you see? The rock is a sandstone, so first there were rocks that
weathered and eroded. The cross-bedding indicates that the sand was
deposited in a dune. The sand was then buried deeply enough that it
turned into rock. This concept will explore how something like sand
could become a rock.

### Sedimentary Rock Formation {#4.html#x-ck12-U2VkaW1lbnRhcnkgUm9jayBGb3JtYXRpb24._10-x1s}

There are two main types of sedimentary rocks: clastic and chemical.
Clastic rocks are made of sediments, which are sometimes called clasts.
Creating rocks from sediments is called **lithification** . Chemicals
precipitate from liquid to form chemical sedimentary rocks.

#### Clastic Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3RpYyBSb2Nrcw.._10-dtf}

Over time, deposited sediments may harden into rock. First, the
sediments are **compacted** . That is, they are squeezed together by the
weight of sediments on top of them. Next, the sediments are **cemented**
together. Minerals fill in the spaces between the loose sediment
particles. These cementing minerals come from the water that moves
through the sediments. Sedimentary rocks that form from sediments are
called “clastic rocks.“ Clastic rocks are rock fragments that are
compacted and cemented together ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DbGFzdGljQ29tcG9zaXRl) ).

#### Chemical Sedimentary Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgU2VkaW1lbnRhcnkgUm9ja3M._10-pva}

Chemical sedimentary rocks form when crystals precipitate out from a
liquid. The mineral halite, also called rock salt, forms this way. You
can make halite! Leave a shallow dish of salt water out in the Sun. As
the water evaporates, salt crystals form in the dish. There are other
chemical sedimentary rocks, like gypsum ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HeXBzdW1Qcm9wZXJ0aWVz) ).

**Can you tell which type of rock these are?**

If you look up close, you would be able to see grains of sand. From this
distance, you can see different layers from where the sand was laid
down. This rock is sandstone. The sand grains are cemented together to
make sandstone. Sandstone is a common type of sedimentary rock.

### Types of Sedimentary Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgU2VkaW1lbnRhcnkgUm9ja3M._11-rpw}

The main types of sedimentary rocks are clastic or chemical. Some
sedimentary rocks are a third type, organic. Clastic sedimentary rocks
are made of sediments. The sediments differ in size. Chemical
sedimentary rocks are made of minerals that precipitate from saline
water. Organic sedimentary rocks are made from the bodies of organisms.

#### Clastic Sedimentary Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3RpYyBTZWRpbWVudGFyeSBSb2Nrcw.._11-6ut}

**Clastic sedimentary rocks** are grouped by the size of the sediment
they contain. Conglomerate and breccia are made of individual stones
that have been cemented together. In conglomerate, the stones are
rounded. In breccia, the stones are angular. Sandstone is made of
sand-sized particles. Siltstone is made of smaller particles. Silt is
smaller than sand but larger than clay. Shale has the smallest grain
size. Shale is made mostly of clay-sized particles and hardened mud.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Rock**                 **Sediment Size**        **Other Features**
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
  Conglomerate             Large                    Rounded

  Breccia                  Large                    Angular

  Sandstone                Sand-sized               

  Siltstone                Silt-sized, smaller than 
                           sand                     

  Shale                    Clay-sized, smallest     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

When sediments settle out of calmer water, they form horizontal layers.
One layer is deposited first, and another layer is deposited on top of
it. So each layer is younger than the layer beneath it. When the
sediments harden, the layers are preserved.

#### Chemical Sedimentary Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgU2VkaW1lbnRhcnkgUm9ja3M._11-sqf}

Sedimentary rocks formed by the crystallization of chemical precipitates
are called **chemical sedimentary rocks** . Dissolved ions in fluids
precipitate out of the fluid and settle out, just like the halite
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDQtMDMtMjUtRXZhcG9yaXRlLWhhbGl0ZS1jb2JibGU.)

Living creatures can help chemicals become sedimentary rocks. Limestone
is an example.

#### Organic Sedimentary Rocks {#4.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5pYyBTZWRpbWVudGFyeSBSb2Nrcw.._11-yxd}

The bodies of organisms can make a sedimentary rock. Plant bodies are
lithified to become coal. When shells are cemented together they make a
type of limestone. So limestone can be considered chemical or organic.

**What is the history of this rock?**

The rock in this photo is a banded gneiss. The bands are made of
different minerals. The light bands are more felsic, and the dark bands
are more mafic. The minerals separated due to heat and pressure. The
waviness of the bands also shows how the rock was hot enough to alter.
It was not hot enough to melt all the way.

### Metamorphism {#4.html#x-ck12-TWV0YW1vcnBoaXNt_12-zc3}

Metamorphic rocks start off as some kind of rock. The starting rock can
be igneous, sedimentary, or even another metamorphic rock. Heat and/or
pressure then change the rock into a metamorphic rock. The change can be
physical, chemical, or both.

During metamorphism, a rock may change chemically. Ions move in or out
of a mineral. This creates a different mineral. The new minerals that
form during metamorphism are more stable in the new environment. Extreme
pressure may lead to physical changes. If pressure is exerted on the
rock from one direction, the rock forms layers. This is **foliation** .
If pressure is exerted from all directions, the rock usually does not
show foliation.

There are two main types of metamorphism: contact and regional.

#### Contact Metamorphism {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29udGFjdCBNZXRhbW9ycGhpc20._12-eom}

**Contact metamorphism** results when magma contacts a rock. The rock
changes because of the magma's extreme heat ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db250YWN0TWV0YW1vcnBoaXNtQ29tcG9zaXRl)
).

</div>

#### Regional Metamorphism {#4.html#x-ck12-UmVnaW9uYWwgTWV0YW1vcnBoaXNt_12-utg}

**Regional metamorphism** occurs over a wide area. Great masses of rock
are exposed to pressure from rock and sediment layers on top of it. The
rock may also be compressed by other geological processes. If the rock
is buried deeply, it may experience high temperatures.

**Figure 4.39**

\(A) Regional metamorphic rocks often display layering called foliation.
(B) Regional metamorphism with high pressures and low temperatures can

</div>

Metamorphism does not cause a rock to melt completely. It only causes
the minerals to change by heat or pressure. If the rock melts
completely, it will cool to become an igneous rock.

Hornfels is a rock with alternating bands of dark and light crystals.
Hornfels is a good example of how minerals rearrange themselves during
metamorphism ( **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SZWdpb25hbE1ldGFtb3JwaGlzbUNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..)
). The minerals in hornfels separate by density. The result is that the
rock becomes banded. Gneiss forms by regional metamorphism from
extremely high temperature and pressure.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-ict}

-   Any type of rock—igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic—can become a
    metamorphic rock.
-   Contact metamorphism occurs when a rock is altered by heat from a
    nearby magma.

**What's the difference in these two rocks?**

The rock on the left was the sedimentary rock shale. Now it's the
metamorphic rock slate. Slate looks very similar to shale, but harder
and more platy. The rock on the right is gneiss. The light and dark
minerals have separated into bands. Gneiss is produced by higher
temperature metamorphism. The original rock was different in both cases.

**Is this what geologists mean by the rock cycle?**

Okay, maybe not. The rock cycle shows how any type of rock can become
any other type of rock. The three rock types are joined together by the
processes that change one to another.

### The Rock Cycle {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJvY2sgQ3ljbGU._14-ns5}

You learned about the three rock types: igneous, sedimentary, and
metamorphic. You also learned that all of these rocks can change. In
fact, any rock can change to become any other type of rock. These
changes usually happen very slowly. Some changes happen below Earth’s
surface. Some changes happen above ground. These changes are all part of
the rock cycle. The **rock cycle** describes each of the main types of
rocks, how they form, and how they change.

The figure below shows how the three main rock types are related to each
other ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDQtMDEtOC1Sb2NrLWN5Y2xl) ). The arrows
within the circle show how one type of rock may change to rock of
another type. These are the processes that change one rock type to
another rock type.

The Rock Cycle.

</div>

#### Processes of the Rock Cycle {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvY2Vzc2VzIG9mIHRoZSBSb2NrIEN5Y2xl_14-ia0}

There are three main processes that can change rock:

-   Cooling and crystallization. Deep within the Earth, temperatures can
    get hot enough to create magma. As magma cools, crystals grow,
    forming an igneous rock. The crystals grow larger if the magma cools
    slowly, as it does if it remains deep within the Earth. If the magma
    cools quickly, the crystals will be very small. When crystals form
    from magma it is called **crystallization** .

<!-- -->

-   Weathering and erosion. Water, wind, ice, and even plants and
    animals all act to wear down rocks. Over time they can break larger
    rocks into sediments. Rocks break down by the process called
    **weathering** . Moving water, wind, and glaciers then carry these
    pieces from one place to another. This is called **erosion** . The
    sediments are eventually dropped, or **deposited** , somewhere. This
    process is called **sedimentation** . The sediments may then be
    compacted and cemented together. This forms a sedimentary rock. This
    whole process can take hundreds or thousands of years.

<!-- -->

-   Metamorphism. This long word means “to change form.“ A rock
    undergoes metamorphism if it is exposed to extreme heat and pressure
    within the crust. With **metamorphism** , the rock does not melt all
    the way. The rock changes due to heat and pressure. A metamorphic
    rock may have a new mineral composition and/or texture.

An interactive rock cycle diagram can be found here:
[http://www.classzone.com/books/earth\_science/terc/content/investigations/es0602/es0602page02.cfm?chapter\_no=investigation](es0602page02.cfm?chapter_no=investigation)

The rock cycle really has no beginning or end. It just continues. The
processes involved in the rock cycle take place over hundreds,
thousands, or even millions of years. Even though for us rocks are solid
and unchanging, they slowly change all the time.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-3kh}

-   The three main rock types are igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary.
-   The three processes that change one rock to another are
    crystallization, metamorphism, and erosion and sedimentation.
-   Any rock can transform into any other rock by passing through one or
    more of these processes. This creates the rock cycle.

## Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-zdc}

All matter is made of tiny particles. Protons, neutrons, and electrons
form atoms that bond together to create molecules. Atoms are the
smallest units that have the properties of an element. Molecules are the
smallest units of a compound. Chemical bonds hold molecules together.
Molecules form the different types of minerals. The silicates make up
most of Earth's crust. Minerals come together to create the three major
rock types. They are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous
rocks form from cooled magma. Sedimentary rocks form from compacted or
cemented sediments. Metamorphic rocks are those that have been altered
by heat and pressure. These three rock types are the material part of
the rock cycle. They are connected by different processes. Different
processes convert any type of rock into any other type of rock. These
processes are weathering and erosion, crystallization, and burial and
pressure, among others. Each rock contains a story of how it formed. For
most rocks it is possible to know what it formed from.

**Is the theory of plate tectonics an example of how a theory comes to
be?**

Scientific ideas do not come to a scientist fully formed. They usually
start as observations. Somewhere along the way the scientist develops a
hypothesis. The scientist finds evidence to support or refute the
hypothesis. If the evidence is in support, the idea evolves into
something bigger. By the time an idea is a theory it is extremely
complex. A theory has a tremendous amount of data to support it. Nothing
substantial refutes it. It probably is extremely important in the area
it addresses. Plate tectonics provides a tremendous example of how a
theory comes to be. In this section we will follow the development of
the theory of plate tectonics. It begins as an observation on how South
America and Africa fit together. And becomes the framework on which much
of geology hangs.

**What does a scientist do with an interesting observation?**

Alfred Wegener made an observation. From that observation, he made a
hypothesis. He collected evidence that would support or refute his
hypothesis. What did that process look like?

### Wegener’s Idea {#5.html#x-ck12-V2VnZW5lcuKAmXMgSWRlYQ..-zou}

**Alfred Wegener** , born in 1880, was a meteorologist and explorer. In
1910, he noticed that South America and Africa appeared to fit together
like puzzle pieces. He was certainly not the first person to notice
this. But he was intrigued by the idea and thought a lot about it. He
wondered if the two continents were once joined and then moved apart? He
set out to find evidence to support or refute this idea.

### Wegener’s Evidence {#5.html#x-ck12-V2VnZW5lcuKAmXMgRXZpZGVuY2U.-qsr}

Here is the main evidence that Wegener and his supporters collected for
his continental drift hypothesis:

#### Fit of the Continents {#5.html#x-ck12-Rml0IG9mIHRoZSBDb250aW5lbnRz-kei}

The continents appear to fit together, and not just South America and
Africa. If the continental margins are included, the fit is even better.

**Figure 5.1**

This figure shows the evolution of the continents, from the
super-continent Pangaea to the way they look now.

#### Distribution of Fossils {#5.html#x-ck12-RGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uIG9mIEZvc3NpbHM.-hdq}

Wegener found fossil evidence that the continents were once joined (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMDc.) ). The same type of
plant and animal fossils are found on continents that are now widely
separated. These organisms would not have been able to travel across the
oceans. So how did the fossils get so far apart?

Fossils of the seed fern Glossopteris are found across all of the
southern continents. These seeds are too heavy to be carried across the
ocean by wind. Mesosaurus fossils are found in South America and South
Africa. Mesosaurus could swim, but only in fresh water. Cynognathus and
Lystrosaurus were reptiles that lived on land. Both of these animals
were unable to swim at all. Their fossils have been found across South
America, Africa, India, and Antarctica.

Wegener thought that all of these organisms must have lived side by
side. The lands later moved apart so that the fossils are separated.

**Figure 5.2**

Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift
hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are
now far apart. Wegener suggested that when the organisms were alive, the
lands were joined and the organisms were living side-by-side.

</div>

#### Distribution of Rocks and Structures {#5.html#x-ck12-RGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uIG9mIFJvY2tzIGFuZCBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVz-lps}

Wegener found rocks of the same type and age on both sides of the
Atlantic Ocean. He thought that it could not be a coincidence! He said
that the rocks must have formed side by side. These rocks then drifted
apart on separate continents.

Wegener also matched up mountain ranges across the Atlantic Ocean. The
Appalachian Mountains were just like mountain ranges in eastern
Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway. Wegener concluded that
they formed as a single mountain range. This mountain range broke apart
as the continents split up. The mountain range separated as the
continents drifted.

#### Climate Zones {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZSBab25lcw..-aux}

Climate is found in zones around the planet. Warm tropical climates are
mostly found near the Equator. Glaciers are mostly found nearer the
poles. Wegener assumed that these things were true in the ancient past.

#### Glaciers {#5.html#x-ck12-R2xhY2llcnM.-9f1}

Wegener looked at evidence from ancient glaciers. Glaciers are found in
very cold climates near the poles. The evidence left by some ancient
glaciers is very close to the Equator. Did glaciers once exist near the
poles? Wegener knew that this was extremely unlikely! However, if the
continents had moved, the glaciers would have been centered close to the
South Pole.

#### Tropics {#5.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGljcw..-gll}

Coral reefs are found only in warm water. Coal swamps are also found in
tropical and subtropical environments. Wegener discovered ancient coal
seams and coral reef fossils in areas that are much too cold today.
Wegener thought that ancient coral and coal plants existed at about the
same latitude where they are found today. He again stated that it was
the continents that moved. An animation showing that Earth’s climate
belts remain in roughly the same position while the continents move is
seen here: [http://www.scotese.com/paleocli.htm](paleocli.htm) .

    Were the continents once joined and then they drifted apart?
-   Wegener collected a great deal of evidence to support his idea.
    Wegener’s evidence included the fit of the continents, the
    distribution of ancient fossils, the placement of similar rocks and
    structures on the opposite sides of oceans, and indicators of
    ancient climate found in locations where those climates do not
    exist today.

**What is continental drift?**

Wegener put together a tremendous amount of evidence that the continents
had been joined. He advanced a great idea. But other scientists didn't
accept it.

### Wegener’s Continental Drift Hypothesis {#5.html#x-ck12-V2VnZW5lcuKAmXMgQ29udGluZW50YWwgRHJpZnQgSHlwb3RoZXNpcw.._1-ocv}

Wegener put his idea and his evidence together in his book, *The Origin
of Continents and Oceans* . The book was first published in 1915. He
included evidence that the continents had been joined. New editions of
the book containing additional evidence were published later.

In his book he said that around 300 million years ago, the continents
had all been joined. They created a single landmass he called Pangaea,
meaning “all earth” in ancient Greek. The supercontinent later broke
apart. Since then the continents have been moving into their current
positions. He called his hypothesis **continental drift** .

### The Problem with the Hypothesis {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByb2JsZW0gd2l0aCB0aGUgSHlwb3RoZXNpcw.._1-0t6}

Wegener had a lot of evidence to support his hypothesis. But he had a
problem. The problem was that he could not explain how the continents
could move through the oceans. He suggested that continental drift
occurred like an icebreaker plows through sea ice ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1JY2VicmVha2Vy) ). He thought the
continents could cut through the ocean floor.

</div>

Other scientists didn't buy his idea. They thought that the continents
would be much more deformed than they are.

Wegener believed that Africa and South America had once been joined. He
had the evidence. But very few scientists accepted his idea. He needed a
mechanism that they would accept.

Alfred Wegener died in 1930 on an expedition on the Greenland icecap.
The continental drift hypothesis was put to rest for a few decades. It
was when technology could provide even more evidence for continental
drift that scientists looked into the idea again. Technology also helped
scientists to develop a mechanism for how continents could drift.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-5iz}

-   Alfred Wegener said that the continents had been joined as a single
    landmass, which he called Pangaea.
-   Wegener thought that Pangaea was together about 300 million
    years ago.
-   Wegener could not develop a mechanism for continents moving through
    oceanic crust that other scientists would accept.

**How did technology play a role in developing Wegener's idea?**

After Wegener's death, the continental drift idea was pretty much dead.
It would have remained that way except for the development of
technology. Using technology, scientists would find more evidence that
continents had drifted. They would also be able to find the mechanism.
This type of magnetometer was one of their important tools.

### Magnetic Polarity {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0aWMgUG9sYXJpdHk._2-0zr}

Some important evidence for continental drift came after Wegener's
death. The following is the magnetic evidence: Earth's magnetic field
surrounds the planet from pole to pole. If you have ever been hiking or
camping, you may have used a compass to help you find your way. A
compass points to the magnetic North Pole. The compass needle aligns
with Earth’s magnetic field.

Some rocks contain little compasses too! As lava cools, tiny iron-rich
crystals line up with Earth’s magnetic field. These crystals are
**magnetite** crystals. Anywhere lavas have cooled, these magnetite
crystals point to the magnetic poles. The little magnets point to where
the North Pole was when the lava cooled. A **magnetometer** is a device
capable of measuring the magnetic field. A magnetometer can be used on
land. A magnetometer also can be dragged behind a ship.

#### Evidence for Continental Drift {#5.html#x-ck12-RXZpZGVuY2UgZm9yIENvbnRpbmVudGFsIERyaWZ0_2-aj6}

Geologists used magnetometers to look at rocks on land. They wanted to
know which direction magnetite crystals pointed. This would tell them
where magnetic north was at the time the rocks cooled. This is what they
learned:

-   Magnetite crystals in fresh volcanic rocks point to the current
    magnetic north pole ( **Figure**
    [below](#5.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDYtMTQtTm9ydGgtcG9sZS1tYWduZXRpYw..) ).

pole](ck12_5_files/20150911025702208326.jpeg "Location of the Earth's current north magnetic pole")

**Figure 5.4**

Earth’s current north magnetic pole is in northern Canada.

</div>

-   Older rocks that are the same age and are on the same continent
    point to the same location. However, the location they point to is
    not the current north magnetic pole.
-   Older rocks that are different ages and are on the same continent do
    not point to the same location. None of them point to the current
    magnetic north pole.
-   Rocks on different continents that are the same age point to
    different locations. Only recent rocks point to the current north
    magnetic pole.

How did the geologists explain this? There is only one logical
explanation. There was almost certainly only one north magnetic pole
through Earth's history. The north magnetic pole is very likely in the
same spot it has always been. If these two things are true, then the
continents have moved.

#### Support for Wegener's Idea {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VwcG9ydCBmb3IgV2VnZW5lcidzIElkZWE._2-ons}

Geologist tested the idea that the pole remained fixed but the
continents moved. They fitted the continents together as Wegener had
done. They moved them into the positions where they had been at the time
the magnetite crystals cooled. The magnetite crystals pointed to the
current north magnetic pole ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA2MDItMDU.) ). The magnetic pole seemed
to have moved, but had not. They named the phenomenon **apparent polar
wander** .

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-s2a}

-   Magnetite is a magnetic mineral found in lava. The magnetite points
    to the magnetic north pole when it cools.

    had been when magnetite crystals cooled.
-   Magnetite crystals of different ages and on different continents
    pointed to different spots. The simplest explanation is that the
    continents have moved.

**How can war further science?**

Oddly, the thing that was needed to further Wegener's continental drift
idea was World War II. U.S. Navy ships cruised the seas. They carried
instruments that helped scientists to locate the mechanism for moving
continents.

### Echo Sounders {#5.html#x-ck12-RWNobyBTb3VuZGVycw.._3-grs}

During World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders.
Their goal was to locate enemy submarines ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMDk.) ). Echo sounders produce sound
waves that travel outward in all directions. The sound waves bounce off
the nearest object and then return to the ship. Scientists know the
speed of sound in seawater. They then can calculate the distance to the
object that the sound wave hit. Most of these sound waves did not hit
submarines. They instead were used to map the ocean floor.

**Figure 5.6**

A ship sends out sound waves to create a picture of the seafloor below
it. The echo sounder pictured has many beams, and, as a result, it
creates a three dimensional map of the seafloor beneath the ship. Early
echo sounders had only a single beam and created a line of depth
measurements.

</div>

### Features of the Seafloor {#5.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgdGhlIFNlYWZsb29y_3-nzq}

Scientists expected the seafloor to be flat and featureless. So they
were shocked by what they saw: tremendous topographical features like
mountain ranges, rifts, and trenches. Oceanographic research vessels
continue to map the seafloor as they sail across the seas today. The map
below is a modern map with data from several decades.

The major features of the ocean basins and their colors on the map
include:

-   **mid-ocean ridges** : A long chain of mountains that rises up high
    above the deep seafloor. An example is the light blue gash in middle
    of Atlantic Ocean. Light blue is higher elevation than dark blue.
-   rift zones: In the middle of the mid-ocean ridges is a rift zone.
    The rift cuts the ridge into pieces. It is lower in elevation than
    the mountains of the mid-ocean ridge.
-   deep sea **trenches** : Trenches are found in the sea. Some are near
    the edges of continents. Trenches are found near chains of
    active volcanoes. An example is the line of the very deepest blue,
    off of western South America.
-   **abyssal plains** : Flat areas that may be dotted with
    volcanic mountains. An example is the consistent blue off of
    southeastern South America.
-   **guyots** : Flat topped mountains that appear to have been eroded.
    Yet these mountains are thousands of feet below sea level.
-   **continental margin** : The transition from the land to the
    deep sea. The continental margin is made of continental crust. More
    than one-quarter of the ocean basin is continental margin.

See if you can identify each of these features on the map (( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA2MDMtMDI.) )) below.

</div>

Of course the first scientists to observe these features wondered how
they had formed. It turns out that they were crucial for fitting
together ideas about seafloor spreading. And seafloor spreading would
turn out to be the mechanism for continental drift.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-n0r}

-   Echo sounders were used to search for enemy submarines during World
    War II. The depths they recorded allowed scientists to piece
    together bathymetric maps of the seafloor. Multi-beam sounders work
    on research vessels today.
-   These maps revealed amazing features like mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea
    trenches, and abyssal plains.
-   The features of the seafloor helped scientists to discover the
    mechanism for continental drift.

**What causes the strange stripes on the seafloor?**

Magnetometers in the oceans discovered strange patterns. This pattern of
stripes is like what they discovered on the seafloor. In this image,
there is a dusky purple stripe in the center. Other colored stripes are
symmetrical about the dusky purple stripe. In the oceans, magnetic
stripes are symmetrical about a mid-ocean ridge axis. What does this
have to do with continental drift?

### Seafloor Magnetism {#5.html#x-ck12-U2VhZmxvb3IgTWFnbmV0aXNt_4-cdj}

Warships also carried magnetometers. Like the echo sounders, the
magnetometers were used to search for submarines. The magnetometers also
revealed a lot about the magnetic properties of the seafloor.

#### Polar Reversals {#5.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgUmV2ZXJzYWxz_4-rvs}

Looking at the magnetism of the seafloor, scientists discovered
something astonishing. Many times in Earth’s history, the magnetic poles
have switched positions. North becomes south, and south becomes north!
When the north and south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists
say it is **normal polarity** . When they are in the opposite position,
they say that it is **reversed polarity** .

#### Magnetic Stripes {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0aWMgU3RyaXBlcw.._4-ucv}

Scientists were even more surprised to discover a pattern of magnetism
on the seafloor. There are stripes with different magnetism. Some
stripes have normal polarity and some have reversed polarity. These
stripes surround the mid-ocean ridges. There is one long stripe with
normal magnetism at the top of the ridge. Next to that stripe are two
long stripes with reversed magnetism. One is on either side of the
normal stripe. Next come two normal stripes and then two reversed
stripes, and so on across the ocean floor. The magnetic stripes end
abruptly at the edges of continents. Sometimes the stripes end at a deep
sea trench ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTE.) ).

**Figure 5.8**

Scientists found that magnetic polarity in the seafloor was normal at
mid-ocean ridges but reversed in symmetrical patterns away from the
ridge center. This normal and reversed pattern continues across the
seafloor.

</div>

Magnetometers are still towed behind research ships. They continue to
map the magnetism of the seafloor.

### Seafloor Ages {#5.html#x-ck12-U2VhZmxvb3IgQWdlcw.._4-uw8}

Different seafloor magnetic stripes equal different ages. By using
geologic dating techniques, scientists could figure out what these ages
are. They found that the youngest rocks on the seafloor were at the
mid-ocean ridges. The rocks get older with distance from the ridge
crest. Scientists were surprised to find that the oldest seafloor is
less than 180 million years old. This may seem old, but the oldest
continental crust is around 4 billion years old.

Scientists discovered another way to tell the approximate age of
seafloor rocks. The rocks at the mid-ocean ridge crest are nearly
sediment free. The crust is also very thin there. With distance from the
ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker. This also supports the
idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis, and that the rocks
get older with distance away from the ridge ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTI.) ). This is because the crust is
new at the ridge, and so it is thin and has no sediment. The crust gets
older away from the ridge crest. It has cooled and has more sediment.

**Figure 5.9**

Seafloor is youngest near the mid-ocean ridges and gets progressively
older with distance from the ridge. Orange areas show the youngest
seafloor. The oldest seafloor is near the edges of continents or deep
sea trenches.

</div>

This leads to an important idea: some process is creating seafloor at
the ridge crest. Somehow the older seafloor is being destroyed. Finally,
we get to the mechanism for continental drift.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-mjt}

-   Data from magnetometers dragged behind ships looking for enemy
    submarines in WWII discovered amazing magnetic patterns on
    the seafloor.
-   The magnetic pole reverses from time to time. The north pole becomes
    the south pole, and the south pole becomes the north pole.
-   Rocks of normal and reversed polarity are found in stripes
    symmetrically about the mid-ocean ridge axis.
-   The seafloor is youngest at the ridge crest and oldest far away from
    the ridge crest. The oldest seafloor rocks are about 180 million
    years, much younger than the oldest continental rocks.

**How do the continents move?**

Harry Hess was a geology professor and a naval officer. He commanded an
attack transport ship during WWII. Hess was intrigued by the seafloor
maps produced with the ship's echo sounder. He thought about all of the
evidence for continental drift. He thought about all of the unusual
features of the seafloor. And he found the mechanism to explain them
all.

### The Evidence Comes Together {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEV2aWRlbmNlIENvbWVzIFRvZ2V0aGVy_5-q4f}

World War II allowed scientists to make some puzzling observations. The
observations came from seafloor bathymetry and magnetism. These
observations are:

-   The seafloor has a large mountain range running through it. Deep
    trenches are found far from the ridges. Guyots have eroded tops that
    are deep below sea level.
-   The magnetic polarity of the seafloor changes. The center of the
    ridge is of normal polarity. Stripes of normal and reverse polarity
    are found symmetrical on both sides of the ridge.
-   The youngest seafloor is at the ridge. The oldest is farthest from
    the ridge. The oldest seafloor is much younger than the
    oldest continent.

Scientists needed to explain these observations.

### Mantle Convection {#5.html#x-ck12-TWFudGxlIENvbnZlY3Rpb24._5-36h}

Not long after Wegener's death, scientists recognized that there is
convection in the mantle. Deeper material is hotter and so it rises.
Near the surface, it becomes cooler and denser so it sinks. This creates
a **convection cell** in the mantle.

### Seafloor Spreading {#5.html#x-ck12-U2VhZmxvb3IgU3ByZWFkaW5n_5-mid}

After the war, Harry Hess put together the ideas and evidence he needed.
Hess resurrected Wegener's continental drift hypothesis. He reviewed the
mantle convection idea. He thought about the bathymetric features and
the patterns of magnetic polarity on the seafloor. In 1962, Hess
published a new idea that he called **seafloor spreading** .

Hess wrote that hot magma rises up into the rift valley at the mid-ocean
ridges. The lava cools to form new seafloor. Later more lava erupts at
the ridge. The new lava pushes the seafloor horizontally away from the
ridge axis ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDYtMjEtTWFnbWEtc2VhZmxvb3ItY3JlYXRpb24.)
). The seafloor moves!

Magnetite crystals in the lava point in the direction of the magnetic
north pole. The different stripes of magnetic polarity reveal the
different ages of the seafloor.

In some places, the oceanic crust comes up to a continent. The moving
crust pushes that continent away from the ridge axis as well. If the
moving oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, the crust sinks into the
mantle. The creation and destruction of oceanic crust is the reason that
continents move.

These animations show the creation of magnetic stripes of normal and
reversed polarity at a mid-ocean ridge:

[http://www.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/animate/A55.gif](A55.gif) .

-   As oceanic crust moves away from the ridge crest, it pushes a
    continent away from the ridge axis.
-   If the oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, it sinks into
    the trench.
-   The oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest in the ocean.

The flat topped guyots were once active volcanoes that were above sea
level. They were eroded at their tops. As the seafloor moved away from
the ridge, the crust sank deeper. The tops of the guyots went below sea
level.

### The Mechanism for Continental Drift {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1lY2hhbmlzbSBmb3IgQ29udGluZW50YWwgRHJpZnQ._5-8jt}

Seafloor spreading is the mechanism that Wegener was looking for!
Convection currents within the mantle drive the continents. The
continents are pushed by oceanic crust, like they are on a conveyor
belt. Over millions of years the continents move around the planet’s
surface. The spreading plate takes along any continent that rides on it.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-nmj}

-   Seafloor spreading is a mixture different ideas and data.
    Continental drift and mantle convection are supported by bathymetric
    and magnetic data from the seafloor.
-   Harry Hess called his idea “an essay in geopoetry." This could be
    because so many ideas fit together so well. It could also be
    because, at the time, he didn’t have all the seafloor data he needed
    for evidence.
-   Seafloor spreading is the mechanism for the drifting continents.

**What do you get when you combine continental drift and seafloor
spreading?**

Plate tectonics! In the next two concepts, we will analyze those words.
What is a plate? What is tectonics? Then we put it together. Alfred
Wegener, who died on the Greenland ice sheet at the age of 50, didn't
live to.

### What is a Plate? {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIFBsYXRlPw.._6-0so}

What portion of Earth makes up the “plates” in plate tectonics? Again,
the answer came about in part due to war. In this case, the Cold War.
The scientists set up seismometer networks during the 1950s and early
1960s. The purpose was to see if other nations were testing atomic
bombs. Since **seismometers** measure ground shaking, they also recorded
earthquakes.

#### Using Earthquakes {#5.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRWFydGhxdWFrZXM._6-xed}

The seismographs located earthquake epicenters. The **epicenter** is the
point on Earth’s surface directly above the place where an earthquake
occurs.

When earthquake epicenters are put on a map, they outline the **plates**
. This is because the earthquakes where the plates come into contact
with each other. Earthquakes are found primarily in lines around the
edges of some continents. They are also found through the centers of
some oceans. Some occur in patches in some land areas.

#### Lithospheric Plates {#5.html#x-ck12-TGl0aG9zcGhlcmljIFBsYXRlcw.._6-rvb}

If you look at the map pictured below, you will see that the lithosphere
is divided into plates ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTQ.) ). There are a dozen major and
several minor plates. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean
basin it contains. Some plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere. A
few are all continental lithosphere. But most plates are made of a
combination of both. Notice the locations where the most earthquake
epicenters are found.

**Figure 5.11**

</div>

Plates of lithosphere sink into the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere,
which is part of the upper mantle, is solid but can flow. If a weight is
added to a plate, like a glacier, the plate will sink into the mantle.
If the weight is taken away, like when the glacier melts, the plate will
rise. This happens slowly over long periods of time.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-dzu}

-   A plate is a large chunk of lithosphere. There are a dozen major
    plates and several minor plates.
-   A plate can carry continental crust, oceanic crust, or some of each.
-   Plates can be identified by the locations of earthquake epicenters.

**What is tectonics?**

Dividing the lithosphere into plates is one thing. Having the plates
move around on the planet is another! A conveyor belt is a good analogy
for how a plate moves. How the plates move and where they move is the
"tectonics" part of plate tectonics.

### Plate Motions {#5.html#x-ck12-UGxhdGUgTW90aW9ucw.._7-alu}

Scientists have determined the direction that each plate is moving (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTU.) ). Plates move
around the Earth’s surface at a rate of a few centimeters a year. This
is about the same rate that fingernails grow.

the plate is moving.

</div>

### How Plates Move {#5.html#x-ck12-SG93IFBsYXRlcyBNb3Zl_7-8uv}

Convection within the Earth’s mantle causes the plates to move. Mantle
material is heated above the core. The hot mantle rises up toward the
surface ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTY.) ). As the
mantle rises, it cools. At the surface, the material moves horizontally
away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. The material continues to cool. It
sinks back down into the mantle at a deep sea trench. The material sinks
back down to the core. It moves horizontally again, completing a
**convection cell** .

**Figure 5.13**

Plates move for two reasons. Upwelling mantle at the mid-ocean ridge
pushes plates outward. Cold lithosphere sinking into the mantle at a
subduction zone pulls the rest of the plate down with it.

**Seafloor spreading** takes place as plates move apart from each other
at a mid-ocean ridge. Mantle convection drives seafloor spreading.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-1in}

**What would Wegener think?**

Like any great theory, plate tectonics makes a tremendous amount of
sense. The whole story fits together so perfectly. Wegener had so much
evidence that the continents had once been joined. Seafloor spreading is
a perfect mechanism for moving those continents. It's really too bad
that Alfred Wegener is not here to learn about the theory of plate
tectonics. It seems certain that he would be ecstatic!

### Plate Tectonics Theory {#5.html#x-ck12-UGxhdGUgVGVjdG9uaWNzIFRoZW9yeQ.._8-hdr}

The theory of plate tectonics is what brings together continental drift
and seafloor spreading. Plates are made of lithosphere topped with
oceanic and/or continental crust. The plates are moved around on Earth's
surface by seafloor spreading. Convection in the mantle drives seafloor
spreading. Oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges. The crust moves
outward from the ridge over time. The crust may eventually sink into the
mantle and be destroyed. If a continent sits on a plate with a mid-ocean
ridge, the continent will be pushed along.

### Plate Boundaries {#5.html#x-ck12-UGxhdGUgQm91bmRhcmllcw.._8-jes}

Two plates meet at a **plate boundary** . There are three types of plate
boundaries since there are three ways that plates can meet. Plates can
move away from each other. They can move toward each other. Finally,
they can slide past each other. The three types of plate boundaries are
divergent, convergent, and transform. They are described in the
following three concepts.

Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. This activity
includes volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building. The activity
occurs as plates interact. Giant slabs of lithosphere moving around can
create a lot of activity! The features seen at a plate boundary are
determined by the direction of plate motion and by the type of crust
found at the boundary.

### What the Theory Explains {#5.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCB0aGUgVGhlb3J5IEV4cGxhaW5z_8-ryc}

The theory of plate tectonics explains most of the features of Earth’s
surface. It explains why earthquakes, volcanoes and mountain ranges are
where they are. It explains where to find some mineral resources. Plate
tectonics is the key that unlocks many of the mysteries of our amazing
planet. Plate tectonics theory explains why:

-   Earth's geography has changed over time and continues to
    change today.
-   some places are prone to earthquakes while others are not.
-   certain regions may have deadly, mild, or no volcanic eruptions.
-   mountain ranges are located where they are.
-   many ore deposits are located where they are.
-   living and fossil species of plants and animals are found where
    they are.
-   some continental margins have a lot of geological activity, and some
    have none.

Plate tectonic motions affect Earth’s rock cycle, climate, and the
evolution of life.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-tsz}

-   The theory of plate tectonics brings together continental drift and
    seafloor spreading.
-   At a plate boundary, two plates can be moving apart, together or
    past each other.
-   Plate tectonics theory explains many things in geology, such as
    where volcanoes, earthquakes, mountain ranges, ore deposits, and
    other features are located.

**Why a photo of a bridge with some bleak looking rock?**

In Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is above sea level. It's the only
place we can see a mid-ocean ridge out of the water. The Midlina Bridge
connects two plates. On the west side is the North American plate. On
the east side is the Eurasian plate. A mid-ocean ridge is where new
crust is created. Eventually this spot will be beneath the Atlantic
Ocean.

### Divergent Plate Boundaries {#5.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJnZW50IFBsYXRlIEJvdW5kYXJpZXM._9-vz4}

Plates move apart at a **divergent plate boundary** . This happens in
the oceans at mid-ocean ridges. It happens on land in continental rift
zones.

#### Mid-ocean Ridges {#5.html#x-ck12-TWlkLW9jZWFuIFJpZGdlcw.._9-cr6}

In the oceans, plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Lava rises upward,
erupts, and cools. Later, more lava erupts and pushes the original
seafloor outward. This is seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading forms
new oceanic crust. The rising magma causes the ridge to be buoyant. This
is why there is a mountain range running through the oceans. The plates
pulling apart cause earthquakes.

Most mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea. The island of
Iceland sits right on the Mid-Atlantic ridge ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTc.) ).

#### Continental Rifting {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50YWwgUmlmdGluZw.._9-bhr}

A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is
called **continental rifting** . Magma rises beneath the continent. The
crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart. This first produces a rift
valley. The East African Rift is a rift valley. Eastern Africa is
splitting away from the African continent. Eventually, as the
continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust will form. This is how the
Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-2rw}

-   Divergent plate boundaries in the ocean create mid-ocean ridges.
    This is where new seafloor is created by upwelling magma.
-   Divergent plate boundaries rift a continent apart. Eventually a new
    ocean will form between the two continents.
-   Iceland is a location where we can see a mid-ocean ridge above
    sea level.

**What does a transform plate boundary look like?**

In the dry part of central California, it looks like this. On one side
is the Pacific Plate. On the other side is the North American Plate.
Before plate tectonics theory, people thought the San Andreas was just a
fault. Now it's known to be a plate boundary!

### Transform Plate Boundaries {#5.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNmb3JtIFBsYXRlIEJvdW5kYXJpZXM._10-d2n}

Two plates may slide past each other in opposite directions. This is
called a **transform plate boundary** . The plates meet at a **transform
fault** . As you might imagine, plates do not slide past each other
easily. These plate boundaries experience massive earthquakes. The
world’s best known transform fault is the San Andreas Fault in
California ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMjY.) ). At
this fault, the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other.
Transform plate boundaries are common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges.
They are very small compared to transform faults on land.

Transform plate boundaries are different from the other two types of
plate boundaries. At divergent plate boundaries, new oceanic crust is
formed. At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed. But at
transform plate boundaries, crust is neither created nor destroyed.

**What do you see when oceanic lithosphere subducts?**

At a convergent plate boundary, when one plate is oceanic, there are
large volcanoes. These volcanoes are found in lines that outline the
subduction zone. Earthquakes also happen in these zones. The Aleutian
Islands that border southern Alaska are an island arc. In this winter
image from space, the volcanoes are covered with snow.

### Convergent Plate Boundaries {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29udmVyZ2VudCBQbGF0ZSBCb3VuZGFyaWVz_11-jx2}

A **convergent plate boundary** forms where two plates collide. That
collision can happen between a continent and oceanic crust, between two
oceanic plates, or between two continents. Oceanic crust is always
destroyed in these collisions.

#### Ocean-Continent Convergence {#5.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4tQ29udGluZW50IENvbnZlcmdlbmNl_11-azt}

Oceanic crust may collide with a continent. The oceanic plate is denser,
so it undergoes **subduction** . This means that the oceanic plate sinks
beneath the continent. This occurs at an ocean trench ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMTk.) ). **Subduction zones** are
where subduction takes place.

**Figure 5.16**

Subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate forms a line
of volcanoes known as a continental arc and causes earthquakes.

</div>

As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting oceanic plate melts
as it reenters the mantle. The magma rises and erupts. This creates a
volcanic mountain range near the coast of the continent. This range is
called a **continental arc** . The Andes Mountains, along the western

#### Ocean-Ocean Convergence {#5.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4tT2NlYW4gQ29udmVyZ2VuY2U._11-cqg}

Two oceanic plates may collide. In this case, the older plate is denser.
This plate subducts beneath the younger plate. As the subducting plate
is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts. The magma this creates rises
and erupts. This forms a line of volcanoes, known as an **island arc** (
**Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMjI.) ). Japan, Indonesia,
the Philippine Islands, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are examples
of island arcs ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1KYXBhbkFyYw..) ).

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-kht}

-   When two plates come toward each other, they create a convergent
    plate boundary.
-   If at least one plate is oceanic, there will be subduction.
-   Subduction of a plate leads to melting and volcanism.
-   An island arc is a line of volcanoes on an oceanic plate. A
    continental arc is a line of volcanoes on a continental plate.

**What do you see at a continent-continent convergent plate boundary?**

Big mountains! The best place to see two continental plates converging
is in the Himalaya Mountains. These mountains are the highest above sea
level on Earth. They are very popular with mountain climbers.

### Continent-Continent Convergence {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50LUNvbnRpbmVudCBDb252ZXJnZW5jZQ.._12-1ae}

Another type of **convergent plate boundary** is when two continental
plates collide. Continental lithosphere is low in density and very
thick. Continental lithosphere cannot subduct. So when two continental
plates collide, they just smash together. This is just like what happens
if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your
hands together. The material has nowhere to go but up ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMjQ.) )! Earthquakes and metamorphic
rocks result from the tremendous forces of the collision. But the crust
is too thick for magma to get through. As a result, there are no
volcanoes at continent-continent collision zones.

**Figure 5.20**

When two plates of continental crust collide, the material pushes
upward. This forms a high mountain range. The remnants of subducted
oceanic crust remain beneath the continental convergence zone.

</div>

### Mountain Building {#5.html#x-ck12-TW91bnRhaW4gQnVpbGRpbmc._12-n3q}

Continent-continent convergence creates some of the world’s largest
mountains ranges. The Himalayas ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1LYXJha29yYW1SYW5nZQ..) ) are the
world's tallest mountains. They are forming as two continents collide.
The Appalachian Mountains are the remnants of a larger mountain range.
This range formed from continent-continent collisions in the time of
Pangaea.

-   Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct.
-   When two continental plates converge, they smash together and
    create mountains.

**Can plate tectonics explain the differences in these beaches?**

Plate tectonics explains why some beaches have lots of cliffs and some
do not. A beach with lots of cliffs is near a plate boundary. A gentle
beach is not. There are exceptions to this rule, but it works in some
cases.

### Continental Margins {#5.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50YWwgTWFyZ2lucw.._13-r8c}

Think of a continent, like North America. Surrounding the continent are
**continental margins** . Continental crust grades into oceanic crust at
continental margins. Continental margins are under water. Almost all of
North America sits on the North American Plate ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OQW1lcmljYW5QbGF0ZQ..) ). Both sides
of the continent have continental margins, but each is very different.
One continental margin of North America is an active margin. The other
is a passive margin. Can you guess which is which?

#### Active Margins {#5.html#x-ck12-QWN0aXZlIE1hcmdpbnM._13-t7b}

If a continental margin is near a plate boundary, it is an **active
margin** . The continental margin of western North America is near a set
of plate boundaries. There are convergent boundaries, like where there
is subduction off of the Pacific Northwest. There is a transform
boundary, the San Andreas Fault. The small amount of the North American
continent that is not on the North American Plate is across the San
Andreas Fault. It is on the Pacific Plate. Western North America has a
lot of volcanoes and earthquakes. Mountains line the region. California,
with its volcanoes and earthquakes, is an important part of this active
margin ( **Figure** [below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DYWxpQmVhY2g.) ).

#### Passive Margins {#5.html#x-ck12-UGFzc2l2ZSBNYXJnaW5z_13-0j6}

There are no volcanoes and very few earthquakes on the eastern edge of
North America. The continental margin is a smooth transition from
continental to oceanic lithosphere. The continental margin there becomes
oceanic lithosphere, but both are on the North American Plate. There is
no plate boundary. The far eastern edge of the North American Plate is
the mid-Atlantic Ridge. The portion of a plate that does not meet
another plate has no geological activity. It is called a **passive
margin** ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy00LTE0LURheXRvbmEtYmVhY2g.) ).

**Is this Earth?**

The existence of Wegener’s supercontinent Pangaea is completely accepted
by geologists today. The movements of continents explain so much about
the geological activity we see. But did it all begin with Pangaea? Or
were there other supercontinents that came before? What does the future
of the continents hold?

### Pangaea {#5.html#x-ck12-UGFuZ2FlYQ.._14-rub}

Wegener had lots of evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. One
line of evidence was the similarity of the mountains on the west and
east sides of the Atlantic. Those mountains rose at convergent plate
boundaries. The continents on both sides of the ocean (where the
Atlantic is now) smashed together to create Pangaea. The proto-Atlantic
ocean shrank as the Pacific Ocean grew.

The Appalachian mountains of eastern North America formed at this
convergent plate boundary ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy0wNS0xNC0wMi1BcHBhbGFjaGlhbi1Nb3VudGFpbnM.)
). About 200 million years ago, they were probably as high as the
Himalayas.

Pangaea has been breaking apart since about 250 million years ago.
Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to
rift apart. The continents are still moving apart. The Pacific is
shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. The Appalachians ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BcHBhbGFjaGlhbnM.) ) are now on a
passive margin. The mighty mountains have weathered and eroded to what
they are today.

### The Supercontinent Cycle {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN1cGVyY29udGluZW50IEN5Y2xl_14-0fe}

Back before Pangaea, there were earlier supercontinents. Rodinia existed
750 million to 1.1 billion years ago. Columbia existed 1.5 to 1.8
billion years ago. If the continents continue in their current
directions, they will come together to create a supercontinent on the
other side of the planet in around 200 million years.

This is known as the **supercontinent cycle** . The continents smash
together on opposite side of the planet around every 500 million years.
The creation of supercontinents is responsible for most of the geologic
features that we see. It is responsible for many features that are long
gone.

This animation shows the movement of continents over the past 600
million years, beginning with the breakup of Rodinia:
[http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/teachers/t\_tectonics/p\_plate\_reconstruction\_blakey.html](p_plate_reconstruction_blakey.html)
.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-3zn}

-   Pangaea came together as a set of continent-continent convergent
    plate boundaries.
-   Pangaea is still breaking up as the continents move apart. The
    Atlantic Ocean is getting bigger, and the Pacific Ocean is
    getting smaller.
-   The continents come together and break apart about every 500
    million years. This is called the supercontinent cycle.

**How come some geological activity takes place away from plate
boundaries?**

The geological activity in these photos is not at plate boundaries. Is
plate tectonics wrong? Of course not! This activity can also be
explained. It's the result of hotspots. Two hotspot locations are Hawaii
and Yellowstone.

### Intraplate Activity {#5.html#x-ck12-SW50cmFwbGF0ZSBBY3Rpdml0eQ.._15-fck}

Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some
activity does not. Much of this **intraplate activity** is found at hot
spots. **Hotspots** are plumes of hot material that rise through the
mantle. Hotspot volcanoes erupt when the hot material melts to create
magma.

Many hotspots appear to be fixed in the mantle. This means that they do
not move relative to each other. Plates move above the hotspots, but the
hotspots stay in the same spot. This feature is a very useful tool for
scientists.

#### Hotspots in the Oceans {#5.html#x-ck12-SG90c3BvdHMgaW4gdGhlIE9jZWFucw.._15-lzc}

A chain of volcanoes form as an oceanic plate moves over a hotspot. This
is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is
moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts
again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is next to the first.
Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above
the hotspot. The oldest is the farthest away ( **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMjg.) ).

</div>

The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot.
The Hawaiian Islands formed most recently. Kilauea volcano is currently
erupting. It is over the hotspot. The Emperor Seamounts are so old they
no longer reach above sea level. The oldest existing of the Emperor
Seamounts is about to subduct into the Aleutian trench off of Alaska.
Older ones may already be in the trench. Geologists can get age dates
from the volcanic rocks that erupt at these hotspots. So they use
hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving.

**Figure 5.28**

Yellowstone Lake lies at the center of a giant caldera. This hole in the
ground was created by enormous eruptions at the Yellowstone hotspot. The
hotspot lies beneath Yellowstone National Park.

</div>

Hotspots are also found under the continental crust. Since it is more
difficult for magma to make it through the thick crust, they are much
less common. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot ( **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDYtMjk.) ). This hotspot is very active.
In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions. Now its
activity is best seen in the region’s famous geysers.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-kcr}

-   Not all geological activity is found at plate boundaries. Activity
    within a plate is called intraplate activity. Most intraplate
    activity occurs at hotspots.
-   Hotspot volcanoes erupt mostly on oceanic crust. A few hotspots
    erupt on continental crust. The difference is due to the thickness
    of the crust.
-   Hotspots can be used to tell the speed and direction that a plate
    is moving.

## Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-72m}

In the early 20th century, Alfred Wegener noticed that Africa and South
America fit together like puzzle pieces. He was not the first person to
make this observation. But he was the first to pursue it. Wegener
gathered a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest that the continents
had once been joined. He proposed the hypothesis that continents move
around on Earth’s surface. He called his hypothesis continental drift.
Unfortunately, Wegener could not come up with a plausible mechanism that
explained how solid continents could plow through ocean basins. At least
not one other scientists would accept. Wegener’s idea was brought back
after World War II. Scientists started to put together data about the
seafloor. It was not flat, but had astonishing features! There was a the
strange pattern of rock ages across the seafloor. Scientists also
noticed a strange history of the magnetic north pole on land. In the
early 1960s, Harold Hess propose seafloor spreading as a mechanism for
drifting continents. The theory of plate tectonics is a combination of
continental drift and seafloor spreading. The theory explains what
happens as plates of Earth’s lithosphere move around on Earth's surface.

**What are the consequences of plate tectonics?**

Giant plates of lithosphere moving around on a sphere has consequences.
Big consequences. Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are due to
plate interactions. Mountains originate where plates interact. If
Earth's crust never moved, there would be a lot fewer natural disasters!

**When people have too much stress they may break. What happens if a
rock gets too much stress?**

Lithospheric plates do a lot of moving on Earth's surface. Slabs of
lithosphere smash into each other. They move sideways past each other
along faults. Where conditions are right, magma rises through solid
rock. It's no wonder that rocks experience stress! Rocks respond
differently to different types of stress and under different conditions.

### Types of Stress {#6.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgU3RyZXNz-hg8}

**Stress** is the force applied to a rock. Plates experience stress when
they collide, move apart, or slide past each other. Plates moving on a
rounded surface experience stress. Stress happens to rocks on a smaller
scale, too. Local movements can cause stress in rocks.

There are four types of stresses that affect rocks:

-   **Confining stress** comes from the weight of all the
    overlying rock. This weight pushes down on a deeply buried rock. The
    rock is being pushed in from all sides, which compresses it. The
    rock will not deform because there is no place for it to move.
-   **Compression** stress squeezes rocks together. Compression causes
    rocks to fold or fracture ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NYXJpbkhlYWRsYW5kc0NB) ). When two
    cars collide, compression causes them to crumple. Compression is the
    most common stress at convergent plate boundaries.

</div>

-   **Tension** stress pulls rocks apart. Tension causes rocks to
    lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress found
    at divergent plate boundaries.
-   **Shear** stress happens when forces slide past each other in
    opposite directions ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMDItYXN5bW1ldHJpYy1zaGVhcg..) ).
    This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries.

This rock has undergone shearing. The pencil is pointing to a line.
Stresses forced rock on either side of that line to go in opposite
directions.

</div>

### Responses to Stress {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVzcG9uc2VzIHRvIFN0cmVzcw..-dzj}

The amount of stress on a rock may be greater than the rock’s strength.
In that case, the rock will undergo **strain** or **deformation** (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA3MDEtMDM.) ). Deep within
the Earth, the pressure is very great. A rock behaves like a stretched
rubber band. When the stress stops, the rock goes back to its original
shape. If more stress is applied to the rock, it bends and flows. It
does not return to its original shape. Near the surface, if the stress
continues, the rock will **fracture** (rupture) and break.

-   Stress is the force applied to an object. Stresses can be confining,
    compression, tension, or shear.
-   Rocks under stress may show strain or deformation. Deformation can
    be elastic or plastic, or the rock may fracture.
-   Rocks respond to stress differently under different conditions.

**What is the pattern of the Grand Canyon rock layers?**

If you go to the Grand Canyon, you'll see layers of sedimentary rocks.
These rocks are extremely well exposed for viewing. Some people call
this "layer cake geology." It looks like a layer cake, but not as tasty.
Just like a cake, the bottom layer is put down first. Subsequent layers
are deposited next. Where the layers are not horizontal, there was
deformation.

### Sedimentary Rock Rules {#6.html#x-ck12-U2VkaW1lbnRhcnkgUm9jayBSdWxlcw.._1-cei}

Sedimentary rocks follow certain rules.

1.  Sedimentary rocks form with the oldest layers on the bottom and the
    youngest on top.
2.  Sediments are deposited horizontally so sedimentary rock layers are
    originally horizontal.
3.  Sedimentary rock layers that are not horizontal are deformed.

Sedimentary rocks start out horizontal with the oldest on the bottom.
Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal must be deformed. This
deformation produces geologic structures such as folds, joints, and
faults that are caused by stresses. We can look at the deformation and
structures out the deformation history of the rock.

### Geologic Structures {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VvbG9naWMgU3RydWN0dXJlcw.._1-iyq}

Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers. This is magnificently
displayed around the southwestern United States. The arid climate allows
rock layers to be well exposed ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMDQtR3JhbmQtU3RhaXJjYXNl) ). The
lowest layers are the oldest, and the higher layers are younger. This
concept is called **superposition** since it deals with the positions of
rock layers.

Layers of different types of rocks are exposed in this photo from Grand

Folds, joints, and faults are caused by stresses. If a sedimentary rock
is tilted or folded, we know that stresses have changed the rock.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-n7g}

-   Sedimentary rocks are laid down horizontally with the oldest at
    the bottom.
-   Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal have been deformed.
-   Sedimentary rocks are very useful for determining the deformation
    history of an area.

**What folds can you see?**

Moving around the desert Southwest, we see a lot of folds. This view is
near the Valley of the Gods in Utah. Can you see all of the types of
folds mentioned below? All of the folds mentioned in the text below are
found in the arid Southwestern U.S.

### Folds {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9sZHM._2-65p}

Deep within the crust, as plates collide, rocks crumple into **folds** .
You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a
piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. Your hands moving toward
each other creates compressive stress. In sedimentary rocks, you can
easily trace the folding of the layers ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMDYtc2VkaW1lbnRhcnktcm9jay1mb2xkcw..)
). In the image below, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They
tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are folded,
they do not return to their original shape.

This is a geologic cross section of the Grand Staircase in Utah. Where

</div>

There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines.

#### Monocline {#6.html#x-ck12-TW9ub2NsaW5l_2-lnw}

A **monocline** is a simple “one step“ bend in the rock layers (
**Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmFuZHZpZXdQaGFudG9tTW9ub2NsaW5l) ).
In a monocline, the oldest rocks are at the bottom, and the youngest are
at the top.

**Figure 6.6**

The rock layers in the center left are tilted in one direction, forming
a monocline.

</div>

#### Anticline {#6.html#x-ck12-QW50aWNsaW5l_2-0rx}

An **anticline** is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from
the center of the fold ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbnRpY2xpbmVDb21wb3NpdGU.) ). The
oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks
are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding
rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a **dome** .
If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at
the center.

#### Syncline {#6.html#x-ck12-U3luY2xpbmU._2-ser}

A **syncline** is a fold that bends downward ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-RmlndXJlLTA3LTA4LVN5bmNsaW5l) ). In a syncline,
the youngest rocks are at the center. The oldest rocks are at the
outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is
called a **basin** . If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at
the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin.

**Why is this lake so long and straight?**

The photo is of Crystal Springs Reservoir near the San Francisco Bay
Area. The water has collected in a low point in the land. The reason for
the low point is a fault, the San Andreas Fault. On one side of the
reservoir is the Pacific Plate. On the other side is the North American
Plate. Would this be a good place to build a home?

### Fractures {#6.html#x-ck12-RnJhY3R1cmVz_3-uzs}

A rock under enough stress will fracture. There may or may not be
movement along the fracture. If there is not movement, the fracture is a
joint. If there is movement, the fracture is a fault.

#### Joints {#6.html#x-ck12-Sm9pbnRz_3-pdz}

If there is no movement on either side of a fracture, the fracture is
called a **joint** . Basalt rocks in Asia show horizontal and vertical
joints ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db2x1bW5hckpvaW50aW5nQXNpYQ..) ).
These joints formed as the lava cooled and contracted.

</div>

#### Faults {#6.html#x-ck12-RmF1bHRz_3-ahq}

If the rocks on one or both sides of a fracture move, the fracture is
called a **fault** ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1GYXVsdGVkWm9uZU1vYWI.) ). Faults can
occur alone or in clusters. A cluster of faults creates a **fault zone**
. Earthquakes happen when rocks break and move suddenly. The energy
released causes an earthquake.

#### Dip-Slip Fault {#6.html#x-ck12-RGlwLVNsaXAgRmF1bHQ._3-orz}

**Slip** is the distance rocks move along a fault, as one block of rock
moves past the other. The angle of a fault is called the fault’s **dip**
. If the fault dips at an angle, the fault is a **dip-slip fault** (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1EaXBTbGlwRmF1bHQ.) ).

Imagine you are standing on a road looking at the fault. The hanging
wall is the rock that overlies the fault. The footwall is beneath the
fault. If you are walking along a fault, the hanging wall is above you.
The footwall is where your feet would be. Miners often extract mineral
resources along faults. They used to hang their lanterns above their
heads. That is why these layers were called the hanging wall.

#### Normal Faults {#6.html#x-ck12-Tm9ybWFsIEZhdWx0cw.._3-sdz}

In **normal faults** , the hanging wall drops down relative to the
footwall. Normal faults are caused by tension that pulls the crust
apart. This causes the hanging wall to slide down. Normal faults can
build huge mountain ranges in regions experiencing tension ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FYXN0ZXJuU2llcnJhTmV2YWRhcw..) ).

#### Thrust Faults {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhydXN0IEZhdWx0cw.._3-wis}

When compression squeezes the crust into a smaller space, the hanging
wall pushes up relative to the footwall. This creates a **reverse
fault** . A **thrust fault** is a type of reverse fault. With a thrust
fault the angle of the fault is close to horizontal. Rocks can slip many
miles along thrust faults ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Mb29uUG9pbnRUaHJ1c3Q.) ).

#### Strike-Slip Faults {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RyaWtlLVNsaXAgRmF1bHRz_3-8nt}

A **strike-slip fault** is a dip-slip fault where the dip of the fault
plane is vertical. Strike-slip faults result from shear stresses. If you
stand with one foot on each side of a strike-slip fault, one side will
be moving toward you while the other side moves away from you. If your
right foot moves toward you, the fault is known as a right-lateral
strike-slip fault. If your left foot moves toward you, the fault is a
left-lateral strike-slip fault ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdHJpa2VTbGlwRmF1bHQ.) ).

#### San Andreas Fault {#6.html#x-ck12-U2FuIEFuZHJlYXMgRmF1bHQ._3-onz}

The San Andreas Fault in California is a right-lateral strike slip fault
( **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyc2NpLTA3LTAyLTA1) ). It is also
a transform fault because the San Andreas is a plate boundary. Unlike
what some people think, California will not fall into the ocean someday.
The land west of the San Andreas Fault is moving northeastward, while
the North American plate moves southwest. Someday, millions of years
from now, Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco!

**How do plate motions create mountains?**

Plate tectonic processes create some of the world's most beautiful
places. The North Cascades Mountains in Washington State are a
continental volcanic arc. The mountains currently host some glaciers.
There are many features left by the more abundant ice age glaciers.
Changes in altitude make the range a habitable place for many living
organisms.

### Stress and Mountain Building {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RyZXNzIGFuZCBNb3VudGFpbiBCdWlsZGluZw.._4-b7o}

Many processes create mountains. Most mountains form along plate
boundaries. A few mountains may form in the middle of a plate. For
example, hotspot volcanoes.

#### Continent-Continent Convergence {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50LUNvbnRpbmVudCBDb252ZXJnZW5jZQ.._4-0mq}

Most of the world’s largest mountains form as plates collide at
convergent plate boundaries. Continental crust is too buoyant to get
pushed down into the mantle. So when the plates smash together, the
crust crumples upward. This creates mountains. Folding and faulting in
these collision zones makes the crust thicker.

The world’s highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India
collides with Eurasia. About 80 million years ago, India was separated
from Eurasia by an ocean ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMTYtaW5kaWEtbW92ZW1lbnQ.) ). As the
plates collided, pieces of the old seafloor were forced over the Asian
continent. This old seafloor is now found high in the Himalayas (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMTctaGltYWxheWFz) ).

#### Oceanic Plate Subduction {#6.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5pYyBQbGF0ZSBTdWJkdWN0aW9u_4-pl5}

Volcanic mountain ranges form when oceanic crust subducts into the
mantle at convergent plate boundaries. The Andes Mountains are a chain
of coastal volcanic mountains. They are forming as the Nazca plate
subducts beneath the South American plate ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMTgtQ290b3BheGk.) ).

#### Rifting {#6.html#x-ck12-UmlmdGluZw.._4-wcg}

Mid-ocean ridges form at divergent plate boundaries. As the ocean floor
separates an enormous line of volcanoes is created.

Continents can also rift apart; a process called **continental rifting**
. When continental crust is pulled apart, it breaks into blocks. These
blocks of crust are separated by normal faults. This is known as **block
faulting** . The blocks slide up or down. The result is alternating
mountain ranges and valleys. This topography is known as basin-and-range
( **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ib3JzdEFuZEdyYWJlbg..) ).
The area near Death Valley, California is the center of a classic
basin-and-range province ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjAtZGVhdGgtdmFsbGV5) ).

**What causes the greatest damage in an earthquake?**

This photo shows the Mission District of San Francisco burning after the
1906 earthquake. The greatest damage in earthquakes is usually not from
the ground shaking. The greatest damage is caused by the effects of that
shaking. In this earthquake, the shaking broke the gas mains and the
water pipes. When the gas caught fire, there was no way to put it out.
Fire causes the greatest damage in many earthquakes.

### Earthquake! {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZSE._5-b4w}

An **earthquake** is sudden ground movement. This movement is caused by
the sudden release of the energy stored in rocks. An earthquake happens
when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks break. An
earthquake’s energy is transmitted by seismic waves.

### Causes of Earthquakes {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIEVhcnRocXVha2Vz_5-jta}

Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate
boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the
plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses
build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was
stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake.
During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely,
they may move as much as a few meters. **Elastic rebound theory**
describes how earthquakes occur ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjEtZWxhc3RpYy1yZWJvdW5k) ).

Elastic rebound theory. Stresses build on both sides of a fault. The
rocks deform plastically as seen in Time 2. When the stresses become too
great, the rocks return to their original shape. To do this, the rocks
move, as seen in Time 3. This movement releases energy, creating an
earthquake.

### Focus and Epicenter {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9jdXMgYW5kIEVwaWNlbnRlcg.._5-qby}

The two important words used to describe an earthquake's location are
focus and epicenter.

#### Focus {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9jdXM._5-rqn}

The point where the rock ruptures is the earthquake’s **focus** . The
focus is below the Earth’s surface. A shallow earthquake has a focus
less than 70 kilometers (45 miles). An intermediate-focus earthquake has
a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus
earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About 75% of
earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles)
of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage. This is because
the focus is near the Earth's surface, where people live.

#### Epicenter {#6.html#x-ck12-RXBpY2VudGVy_5-72c}

The area just above the focus, on the land surface, is the earthquake’s
**epicenter** ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjItZXBpY2VudGVy) ). The towns or
cities near the epicenter will be strongly affected by the earthquake.

**Figure 6.22**

The focus of an earthquake is where the ground breaks. The epicenter is
the point at the surface just above the focus.

</div>

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-nfg}

-   A sudden release of energy stored in rocks causes an earthquake.
-   The focus is where the rocks rupture. The epicenter is the point on
    the ground directly above the focus.
-   Most earthquakes are shallow. Shallow earthquakes do the
    most damage.

**What caused the earthquake in Angol, Chile in 2010?**

Angol, Chile experienced a huge 8.8 magnitude earthquake in February
2010. The earthquake was due to subduction of the Nazca plate beneath
South America. This subduction zone is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.

### Annual Earthquakes {#6.html#x-ck12-QW5udWFsIEVhcnRocXVha2Vz_6-wkc}

In a single year, on average, more than 900,000 earthquakes are
recorded. About 150,000 of them are strong enough to be felt. Each year
about 18 earthquakes are major, with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9,
and on average one earthquake has a magnitude of 8 to 8.9.

Magnitude 9 earthquakes are rare. The United States Geological Survey
lists five since 1900 ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2ljLTA3MDMtMDQ.) and **Table**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TWFnOUVRcw..) ). All but the Great Indian
Ocean Earthquake of 2004 occurred somewhere around the Pacific Ocean
basin.

### Earthquake Zones {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZSBab25lcw.._6-ljc}

Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of
plate boundaries.

-   About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin
    because it is lined with convergent and transform boundaries (
    **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDctMjMtRWFydGhxdWFrZXMtOC4wLWdyZWF0ZXI.) ).
    The region around the Pacific is called the Pacific **Ring of Fire**
    due to its earthquakes and volcanoes.
-   About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt. Convergence
    is causing the Indian Plate to run into the Eurasian Plate.
-   The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries. A few
    earthquakes take place away from plate boundaries. These are
    intraplate earthquakes.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-zrs}

-   Small earthquakes are extremely common, but the largest earthquakes
    are extremely rare.
-   The vast majority of earthquakes happen at plate boundaries.
-   The Pacific Ocean basin has the most earthquakes due to convergent
    and transform plate boundaries. The Himalaya region has the second
    most due to the convergence of India and Asia.

**What does the future of San Francisco hold?**

The last large earthquake along the San Andreas Fault in the San
Francisco area stuck in 1906. The city was devastated. Studies show that
big quakes occur every 125 years or more. Small quakes seem to precede
large ones, and there have been some small ones in recent years. What do
you think the future holds for San Francisco?

### Transform Plate Boundaries {#6.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNmb3JtIFBsYXRlIEJvdW5kYXJpZXM._7-wfo}

Transform plate boundaries produce enormous and deadly earthquakes.
These quakes at transform faults are shallow focus. This is because the
plates slide past each other without moving up or down.

The San Andreas Fault that runs through much of California is an
enormous transform plate boundary. It is the plate boundary between
Pacific and North American plates. The largest earthquake in recorded
history on the San Andreas Fault occurred in 1906. The quake's epicenter
was just north of in San Francisco. About 3,000 people died and 28,000
buildings were lost, mostly in the fire that followed the earthquake.

There are many other faults spreading off the San Andreas, to take up
the plate motion. In total the San Andreas Fault system produces around
10,000 earthquakes a year ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjQtQmF5LUFyZWEtRmF1bHQtTGluZXM.) ).
While most of those earthquakes cannot even be felt by people nearby,
occasionally one is very strong. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the
Hayward Fault was the site of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 1868.

Other significant earthquakes in California include the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake near Santa Cruz ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjMtTG9tYS1QcmlldGE.) ) and the 1994

Although California is prone to many natural hazards, including volcanic
eruptions at Mt. Shasta or Mt. Lassen, and landslides on coastal cliffs,
the natural hazard the state is linked with is earthquakes. In this
video, the boundaries between three different tectonic plates and the
earthquakes that result from their interactions are explored.

New Zealand also has a transform fault with strike-slip motion, causing
about 20,000 earthquakes a year! Only a small percentage of those are
large enough to be felt. A 6.3 quake in Christchurch in February 2011
killed about 180 people.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-cch}

-   Transform fault earthquakes have shallow focus because the plates
    meet near the surface.
-   The San Andreas Fault is actually a fault zone made up of a number
    of other active faults.
-   New Zealand also has a transform plate boundary.

**What damage is done to people's lives by earthquakes?**

In a large earthquake hundreds or thousands of people may die. Many more
may lose their homes and livelihoods. After a large quake, the world's
attention turns to help the victims. But soon there is another disaster
in the news, and the world's attention turns. People may be left
homeless due to an earthquake for many years.

### Convergent Plate Boundaries {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29udmVyZ2VudCBQbGF0ZSBCb3VuZGFyaWVz_8-hkd}

Earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the location of the
subducting lithosphere. The motion of the lithosphere as it plunges
through the mantle causes the quakes ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDctMjAtRWFydGhxdWFrZS1lcGljZW50ZXJz) ).
At greater depths, the plate heats up enough to deform plastically.

Convergent plate boundaries produce earthquakes most of the way around
the Pacific Ocean basin.

#### Ocean-Ocean: Japan {#6.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4tT2NlYW46IEphcGFu_8-sgj}

Earthquakes in Japan are caused by ocean-ocean convergence. In this part
of the Pacific Ocean, oceanic crust subducts beneath oceanic crust. This
creates as many as 1,500 earthquakes every year.

In March 2011, the 9.0 magnitude Tōhoku earthquake struck off of
northeastern Japan. Damage from the quake was severe. Even more severe
was the damage from the tsunami generated by the quake ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy0yMDExVG9ob2t1RWFydGhxdWFrZURhbWFnZQ..)
and **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyc2NpLTA3LTAyLTA4) ). A
**tsunami** is an enormous ocean wave or set of waves generated by an
underwater earthquake. In all, 25,000 people were known dead or missing.

#### Ocean-Continent: Cascades {#6.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4tQ29udGluZW50OiBDYXNjYWRlcw.._8-7uw}

The Pacific Northwest of the United States is at risk from a potentially
massive earthquake. The subduction of three small plates beneath North
America produces active volcanoes, the Cascades. The region also
experiences earthquakes. However, large earthquakes only hit every 300
to 600 years. The last was in 1700. That quake had an estimated
magnitude of around 9. A quake of that magnitude today could produce an
incredible amount of destruction and untold fatalities.

An image of earthquake epicenters beneath the Pacific Northwest and the
depth to the epicenter is shown here: [http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/91/]() .

Elastic rebound at a subduction zone generates an earthquake in this

.

#### Continent-Continent: Asia {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50LUNvbnRpbmVudDogQXNpYQ.._8-z5k}

The collision of two continents also creates massive earthquakes. Many
earthquakes happen in the region in and around the Himalayan Mountains.
The 2001 Gujarat, India earthquake is responsible for about 20,000
deaths, with many more people injured or made homeless ( **Figure**

**When can you go up in the Washington Monument again?**

An earthquake in August 2011 in Virginia cracked the top of the
Washington Monument. After 32 months of repair, the monument reopened to
the public. Other sites in Washington, D.C., like the National
Cathedral, were also damaged.

### Intraplate Earthquakes {#6.html#x-ck12-SW50cmFwbGF0ZSBFYXJ0aHF1YWtlcw.._9-uge}

About 5% of earthquakes take place within a plate, away from plate
boundaries. These **intraplate earthquakes** are caused by stresses
within a plate. Since plates move over a spherical surface, zones of
weakness are created. Intraplate earthquakes happen along these zones of
weakness. The earthquakes may take place along ancient faults or rift
zones.

#### 2011 Virginia Earthquake {#6.html#x-ck12-MjAxMSBWaXJnaW5pYSBFYXJ0aHF1YWtl_9-l4d}

In August 2011, the eastern seaboard of the U.S. was rocked by a
magnitude 5.8 earthquake. While not huge, most of the residents had
never experienced an earthquake. Many didn't know what had happened!

This region is no longer part of an active plate boundary. But a few
hundred million years ago, at the end of the Paleozoic, things were
different. Continent-continent convergence was bringing Pangaea
together. This region was being uplifted into the ancestral Appalachian
mountains. There are still ancient faults that sometimes reactivate.

#### New Madrid Earthquake {#6.html#x-ck12-TmV3IE1hZHJpZCBFYXJ0aHF1YWtl_9-vfi}

In 1812, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck near New Madrid, Missouri.
The earthquake was strongly felt over approximately 50,000 square miles.
The quake even altered the course of the Mississippi River. Because very
few people lived in the area at the time, only 20 people died. Many more
people live there today ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1OZXdNYWRyaWQ.) ). A similar earthquake
today would undoubtedly kill many people and cause a great deal of
property damage. The New Madrid Seismic Zone continues to be active.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-knk}

-   Intraplate earthquakes occur because solid lithosphere travels on a
    round planet.
-   Intraplate earthquakes hit reactivated ancient faults.
-   Intraplate earthquakes are not usually as large as quakes along
    plate boundaries. Still, they can do a great deal of damage.

**Are seismic waves like ocean waves?**

Yes, in some ways. Ocean waves travel at the interface between the sea
surface and the atmosphere. They have all the features that all waves
have. Some seismic waves also travel at an interface. Which ones?

### Seismic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-U2Vpc21pYyBXYXZlcw.._10-mtf}

Seismic waves are the energy from earthquakes. Seismic waves move
outward in all directions away from their source. Each type of seismic
wave travels at different speeds in different materials. All seismic
waves travel through rock, but not all travel through liquid or gas.
Geologists study seismic waves to learn about earthquakes and the
Earth’s interior.

#### Wave Structure {#6.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZSBTdHJ1Y3R1cmU._10-xki}

Seismic waves are just one type of wave. Sound and light also travel in
waves. Every wave has a high point called a **crest** and a low point
called a **trough** . The height of a wave from the center line to its
crest is its **amplitude** . The horizontal distance between waves from
crest to crest (or trough to trough) is its **wavelength** ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjctc2Vpc21pYy13YXZlcw..) ).

this diagram.

</div>

#### Types of Seismic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgU2Vpc21pYyBXYXZlcw.._10-yg1}

There are two major types of seismic waves. **Body waves** travel
through the Earth’s interior. **Surface waves** travel along the ground
surface. In an earthquake, body waves are responsible for the sharp
jolts. Surface waves are responsible for the rolling motions that do
most of the damage in an earthquake.

#### Body Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-Qm9keSBXYXZlcw.._10-xmu}

**Primary waves (P-waves)** and **secondary waves (S-waves)** are the
two types of body waves ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjgtYm9keS13YXZlcw..) ). Body waves
move at different speeds through different materials.

P-waves are faster. They travel at about 6 to 7 kilometers (about 4
miles) per second. Primary waves are so named because they are the first
waves to reach a seismometer. P-waves squeeze and release rocks as they
travel. The material returns to its original size and shape after the
P-wave goes by. For this reason, P-waves are not the most damaging
earthquake waves. P-waves travel through solids, liquids, and gases.

S-waves are slower than P-waves. They are the second waves to reach a
seismometer. S-waves move up and down. They change the rock’s shape as
they travel. S-waves are about half as fast as P-waves, at about 3.5 km
(2 miles) per second. S-waves can only move through solids. This is
because liquids and gases don’t resist changing shape.

**Figure 6.34**

Love waves and Rayleigh waves are the two types of surface waves.

</div>

Surface waves travel along the ground outward from an earthquake’s
epicenter. Surface waves are the slowest of all seismic waves. They
travel at 2.5 km (1.5 miles) per second. There are two types of surface
waves. **Love waves** move side-to-side, much like a snake. **Rayleigh
waves** produce a rolling motion as they move up and backward (
**Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMjktc3VyZmFjZS13YXZlcw..)
). Surface waves cause objects to fall and rise. They also cause objects
to sway back and forth. These motions cause damage to rigid structures
during an earthquake.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-r6z}

-   Body waves travel through the body of a planet. Surface waves travel
    along the surface.
-   There are two types of body waves: P-waves travel fastest and
    through solids, liquids, and gases; S-waves only travel
    through solids.
-   Surface waves are the slowest, but they do the most damage in
    an earthquake.

**What if you could predict an earthquake?**

What would make a good prediction? Knowing where, when, and the
magnitude of the quake would make it possible for people to evacuate. If
you were right, you would be famous! But if you were wrong, many people
would be angry with you.

### Earthquake Prediction {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZSBQcmVkaWN0aW9u_11-oqs}

Scientists are a long way from being able to predict earthquakes. A good
prediction must be detailed and accurate. Where will the earthquake
occur? When will it occur? What will be its approximate magnitude? With
a good prediction, authorities could get people to evacuate. But if the
prediction were wrong, a lot of money would be lost as people closed
businesses and skipped work. Plus people would be unlikely to believe
the authorities the next time.

#### Predicting Where {#6.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGljdGluZyBXaGVyZQ.._11-t9w}

Where an earthquake will occur is the easiest feature to predict. How
would you predict this? Scientists know that earthquakes take place at
plate boundaries. They tend to happen where they’ve happened before (
**Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMzctVVMtcXVha2UtaGF6YXJkLW1hcA..) ).

Fault segments behave consistently. A segment with frequent small
earthquakes will likely continue to have frequent small earthquakes. A
fault segment with infrequent huge earthquakes will likely have
infrequent huge earthquakes. The image below shows the probabilities of
earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area (

#### Predicting When {#6.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGljdGluZyBXaGVu_11-xpb}

When an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict. Stress
on a fault builds up at the same rate over time. So earthquakes should
occur at regular intervals. But, so far, scientists cannot predict when
quakes will occur even to within a few years. Around Parkfield,
California, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about every
22 years. So seismologists predicted that one would strike in 1993. But
that quake came in 2004—11 years late ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDctNDMtQXJvdW5kLVBhcmtmaWVsZA..) ).

### Earthquake Signs {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZSBTaWducw.._11-0vr}

There are sometimes signs that a large earthquake is coming. There may
be small quakes, called **foreshocks** . These can occur a few seconds
to a few weeks before a major quake. Unfortunately, foreshocks are not
very useful for predicting large earthquakes. Many quakes do not have
foreshocks. Also, small earthquakes are not necessarily followed by a
large earthquake.

There are other possible signs before an earthquake. The ground may
tilt. Ground tilting is caused by the buildup of stress in the rocks.
This may happen before a large earthquake, but it doesn't always. Water
levels in wells may fluctuate. This is because water may move into or
out of fractures before an earthquake. This is also an uncertain way to
predict an earthquake. The difference in arrival times of P-waves and
S-waves may decrease just before an earthquake occurs.

Folklore tells of animals behaving strangely just before an earthquake.
Most people tell stories of these behaviors after the earthquake.
Chinese scientists have actively studied the behavior of animals before
earthquakes to see if there is a connection. So far nothing concrete has
come of these studies.

Actions can reduce the damage once an earthquake has started.
Seismometers can detect P-waves a few seconds before more damaging
S-waves and surface waves arrive. In this time computers can shut down
gas mains and electrical transmission lines. They can initiate
protective measures in chemical plants, nuclear power plants, mass
transit systems, airports, and roadways. Just a few seconds can be
tremendously valuable.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-sm2}

-   A good prediction must indicate when and where an earthquake will
    take place.
-   Fault segments behave the same way over time.
-   Signs that an earthquakes may occur include foreshocks, ground
    tilting, water levels in wells, and the relative arrival times of P-
    and S-waves.

**Why should you pay attention in school?**

Eleven-year-old Tilly Smith and her family were walking along the beach
in Phuket, Thailand on December 26, 2004. Tilly noticed that the sea was
bubbling. She thought this was like a video she'd seen in geography
class two weeks earlier. The English schoolgirl insisted to her parents
that a tsunami was coming. Her warning saved the approximately 100
tourists and civilians who were on that beach.

### Tsunami {#6.html#x-ck12-VHN1bmFtaQ.._12-zdj}

Earthquakes can cause **tsunamis** . These deadly ocean waves may result
from any shock to ocean water. A shock could be a meteorite impact,
landslide, or a nuclear explosion. But most come from large underwater
earthquakes.

An underwater earthquake creates a tsunami this way: the movement of the
crust displaces water. The displacement forms a set of waves. The waves
travel at jet speed through the ocean. Since the waves have low
amplitudes and long wavelengths, they are unnoticed in deep water. As
the waves reach shore they compress. They are also pushed upward by the
shore. For these reasons, tsunamis can grow to enormous wave heights.
Tsunami waves can cause tremendous destruction and loss of life.
Fortunately, few undersea earthquakes generate tsunamis.

#### The Boxing Day Tsunami, 2004 {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJveGluZyBEYXkgVHN1bmFtaSwgMjAwNA.._12-5nu}

The Boxing Day Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004. The tsunami was
caused by one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded. The Indian Ocean
Earthquake registered magnitude 9.1. The quake struck near Sumatra,
Indonesia, where the Indian plate is subducting beneath the Burma plate.
It released about 550 million times the energy of the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima.

Several tsunami waves were created. The waves went around the Indian
Ocean and struck eight countries ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy0yMDA0SW5kb25lc2lhVHN1bmFtaU1hcA..) ).

About 230,000 people died. More than 1.2 million people lost their
homes. Many more lost their way of making a living. Fishermen lost their
boats, and businesspeople lost their restaurants and shops. Many marine
animals washed onshore, including dolphins, turtles, and sharks.

#### Japan Tsunami, 2011 {#6.html#x-ck12-SmFwYW4gVHN1bmFtaSwgMjAxMQ.._12-qwc}

The Japanese received a one-two punch in March 2011. The 2011 Tōhoku
earthquake offshore was a magnitude 9.0, and damage from the quake was
extensive. The earthquake generated massive tsunami waves which hit the
island nation. Waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet).

The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake. In the
photo of Sendai ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDctVG9ob2t1LWVhcnRocXVha2UtYWVyaWFs) ),
the black smoke is coming from an oil refinery. The refinery was set on
fire due to the earthquake. The tsunami prevented efforts to extinguish
the fire for several days.

Worst of all was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the
northeastern coast. Eleven reactors were automatically shut down. Power
and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant. This lead to
equipment failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials.
Cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many years.

### Tsunami Warning Systems {#6.html#x-ck12-VHN1bmFtaSBXYXJuaW5nIFN5c3RlbXM._12-ggk}

Most of the Indian Ocean tragedy could have been avoided if a warning
system had been in place ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMzItdHN1bmFtaS13YXJuaW5nLXN5c3RlbQ..)
). As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean now has a warning system.
Communities around the Pacific have had a tsunami warning system since
1948.

</div>

As in Japan, warning systems aren’t always helpful. People in
communities very close to the earthquake do not have enough time to move
out of the area. Farther away from the quake, evacuation of low-lying
areas saves lives.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-lp5}

-   Tsunamis have relatively low amplitude and long wavelengths. They
    are not noticeable until they move up a shore.

**Have you ever felt an earthquake?**

Small earthquakes are fairly common in some parts of the world.
Depending on the quake, the land, and the setting, people experience
them differently. You may wonder why your chair is moving, when you are
sitting still. You may think someone is running across the roof. In a
skyscraper, you may be swaying. Seismometers quantify this and record
the energy released in the quake.

### Measuring Seismic Waves {#6.html#x-ck12-TWVhc3VyaW5nIFNlaXNtaWMgV2F2ZXM._13-qhb}

Seismic waves are measured on a seismograph. Seismographs contain a lot
of information, and not just about earthquakes.

#### Seismometers {#6.html#x-ck12-U2Vpc21vbWV0ZXJz_13-ae8}

A **seismograph** is a machine that records seismic waves. In the past,
seismographs produced a **seismogram** . A seismogram is a paper record
of the seismic waves the seismograph received. Seismographs have a
weighted pen suspended from a stationary frame. A drum of paper is
attached to the ground. As the ground shakes in an earthquake, the pen
remains stationary but the drum moves beneath it. This creates the
squiggly lines that make up a seismogram ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TZWlzbW9ncmFwaFBpbmF0dWJv) ).

This seismograph records seismic waves.

</div>

Modern **seismometers** record ground motions using electronic motion
detectors. The data are then kept digitally on a computer.

#### What We Learn from Seismograms {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBXZSBMZWFybiBmcm9tIFNlaXNtb2dyYW1z_13-hge}

Seismograms contain a lot of information about an earthquake: its
strength, length, and distance. Wave height is used to determine the
magnitude of the earthquake. The seismogram shows the different arrival
times of the seismic waves ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMzQtc2Vpc21vZ3JhbS1QLVMtd2F2ZS1hcnJpdmFs)
). The first waves are P-waves since they are the fastest. S-waves come
in next and are usually larger than P-waves. The surface waves arrive
just after the S-waves. If the earthquake has a shallow focus, the
surface waves are the largest ones recorded.

**Figure 6.42**

These seismograms show the arrival of P-waves and S-waves.

</div>

A seismogram may record P-waves and surface waves, but not S-waves. This
means that it was located more than halfway around the Earth from the
earthquake. What does that mean? Earth's outer core is liquid. S-waves
cannot travel through liquid. So the liquid outer core creates an S-wave
shadow zone on the opposite side of the Earth from the quake.

Like most things, seismographs are now digital. Information from seismic
waves is fed into computers at seismic stations around the world.

This animation shows three different stations picking up seismic waves:

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-h8t}

-   A seismograph records seismic waves on a seismogram. A seismometer
    is a digital seismic wave recorder.
-   S-waves do not travel through liquids. So a seismogram with no
    S-waves is on the other side of the planet from the quake.
-   Seismographs yield a tremendous amount of information about
    an earthquake.

**Can you find an earthquake epicenter?**

The epicenter of the 2011 Japan earthquake was just offshore of Sendai.
This is where the Pacific Plate plunges into a subduction zone. The
earthquake had a relatively shallow depth of 20 miles (32 km). Remember
that shallow quakes typically cause the most damage. How do scientists
find an earthquake epicenter?

### Finding the Epicenter {#6.html#x-ck12-RmluZGluZyB0aGUgRXBpY2VudGVy_14-zlf}

One seismogram indicates the distance to the epicenter. This is
determined by the P-and S-wave arrival times. If a quake is near the
seismograph, the S-waves arrive shortly after the P-waves. If a quake is
far from the seismograph, the P-waves arrive long before the S-waves.
The longer the time is between the P-and S-wave arrivals, the further
away the earthquake was from the seismograph. First, seismologists
calculate the arrival time difference. Then they know the distance to
the epicenter from that seismograph. They can connect all the points
that are that distance from the seismic station. This makes a circle
around the station!

Next, the seismologists try to determine the location of the earthquake
epicenter. To do this they need the distances to the epicenter from at
least three seismographs. Let’s say that they know that an earthquake’s
epicenter is 50 kilometers from Kansas City. They draw a circle with a
50 km radius around that seismic station. They do this twice more around
two different seismic stations. The three circles intersect at a single
point. This is the earthquake’s epicenter ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMzUtZmluZGluZy1lcGljZW50ZXI.) ).

**How do scientists measure earthquakes?**

This 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile in 2010 caused over 500 deaths
and thousands of injuries. Earthquakes and the damage they cause can be
measured in a few different ways. One way is to describe the damage. The
other way is to measure the energy of the quake.

### Earthquake Intensity {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZSBJbnRlbnNpdHk._15-ibz}

The ways seismologists measure an earthquake have changed over the
decades. Initially, they could only measure what people felt and saw:
the intensity. For this, they used the Mercalli scale.

##### Mercalli Scale {#6.html#x-ck12-TWVyY2FsbGkgU2NhbGU._15-grb}

Early in the 20th century, earthquakes were described in terms of what
people felt and the damage that was done to buildings. The **Mercalli
intensity scale** describes earthquake intensity.

There are many problems with the Mercalli scale. The damage from an
earthquake is affected by many things. The type of ground a building
sits on is very important to what happens to that building in a quake.
Different people experience an earthquake differently. Using this scale,
comparisons between earthquakes were difficult to make. A new scale was
needed.

### Earthquake Magnitude {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZSBNYWduaXR1ZGU._15-pni}

For decades scientists have had equipment that can measure earthquake
magnitude. The earthquake magnitude is the energy released during the
quake.

#### The Richter Magnitude Scale {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJpY2h0ZXIgTWFnbml0dWRlIFNjYWxl_15-jgf}

Charles Richter developed the **Richter magnitude scale** in 1935. The
Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake's largest jolt of
energy. This is determined by using the height of the waves recorded on
a seismograph.

The Richter scale is logarithmic. The magnitudes jump from one level to
the next. The height of the largest wave increases 10 times with each
level. So the height of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake
is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake. A magnitude 5 is 100 times that
of a magnitude 3 quake. With each level, thirty times more energy is
released. A difference of two levels on the Richter scale equals 900
times more released energy.

The Richter scale has limitations. A single sharp jolt measures higher
on the Richter scale than a very long intense earthquake. Yet, this is
misleading because the longer quake releases more energy. Earthquakes
that release more energy are likely to do more damage. As a result,
another scale was needed.

#### The Moment Magnitude Scale {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1vbWVudCBNYWduaXR1ZGUgU2NhbGU._15-rev}

The **moment magnitude scale** is the favored method of measuring
earthquake magnitudes. It measures the total energy released by an
earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated by two things. One is the
length of the fault break. The other is the distance the ground moves
along the fault. Japan's Tōhoku earthquake in 2011 had a magnitude of
9.0 ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDctMzYtamFwYW4tdHN1bmFtaS1kYW1hZ2U.) ).

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-wfz}

-   Mercalli Intensity Scale depends on many factors other than the
    amount of energy released in the earthquake. These factors include
    the type of rock in the region. They also include the quality of the
    structures built in the area.
-   The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the largest
    jolt of energy released by an earthquake.
-   The moment magnitude scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the
    total amount of energy released by an earthquake.

**Is earthquake magnitude the most important factor in determining
damage?**

The type of construction has a tremendous effect on what happens during
an earthquake. Damage and deaths are directly affected by the
construction in an earthquake. For example, enormous damage was done in
the 2011 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquake. However, far less was
damaged in an earthquake of the same magnitude near the area in Iceland
seen above.

### Damage from Earthquakes {#6.html#x-ck12-RGFtYWdlIGZyb20gRWFydGhxdWFrZXM._16-bkl}

We know that earthquakes kill lots of people. However, the ground
shaking almost never kills people. Unlike in cartoons, the ground does
not swallow someone up! Deaths depend somewhat on an earthquake's size
and the type of ground people inhabit. But a very important factor is
the quality of the structures. People are killed when structures fall on
them. More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that
follow an earthquake. Of course, the number of deaths is different from
the property damage that a quake does.

#### What Makes an Earthquake Deadly? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBNYWtlcyBhbiBFYXJ0aHF1YWtlIERlYWRseT8._16-ql8}

What makes an earthquake deadly?

-   Population density. The magnitude 9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake, near
    Anchorage, of 1964 resulted in only 131 deaths. At the time few
    people lived in the area ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA3MDQtMDM.) ).

-   Size, but not size. No one dies in a magnitude 1.0 earthquake. But
    large quakes to not always kill a lot of people. Only about 2,000
    people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake. This was the
    largest earthquake ever recorded. The Indian Ocean earthquake of
    2004 was one of the largest ever. Still, most of the 230,000
    fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake.
-   Ground type. Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft sediments, so
    there is less damage on bedrock. Sometimes sediments become
    saturated with water. They then undergo **liquefaction** and become
    like quicksand ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA3MDQtMDI.) ). Soil on a hillside
    may become a landslide.

#### City Planning {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2l0eSBQbGFubmluZw.._16-lr1}

In earthquake-prone areas, city planners try to reduce hazards. They
look at both the likelihood of a quake and the damage one would do. For
example, in the San Francisco Bay Area, maps show how much shaking is
expected for different ground types ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA3MDQtMDE.) ). This allows planners to
locate new hospitals and schools more safely.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-aio}

-   Seismic waves rarely kill anyone. Structures falling on people and
    fires or tsunamis after the earthquake cause many more fatalities.
-   City planning can lessen the damage done by earthquakes.
-   Population density and ground type affect the number of fatalities.

**Why is California Memorial Stadium called a "tectonic time bomb"?**

The California Memorial Stadium is the home of football at the
University of California, Berkeley. The site probably looked flat and
easy to build on in 1922. But now scientists know that the Hayward Fault
passes directly beneath both end zones. The stadium has been renovated
in a \$321 million project. The renovation involved 10 miles of steel
cables, silicone fluid-filled shock absorbers, concrete piers, 3-feet of
sand, plastic sheeting, and stone columns. Go Bears!

### New Construction {#6.html#x-ck12-TmV3IENvbnN0cnVjdGlvbg.._17-jht}

New construction can be made safer in many ways:

-   Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be
    anchored to bedrock. Sometimes the bedrock lies hundreds of meters
    below the ground surface.
-   The correct building materials must be used. Houses should bend
    and sway. Wood and steel are better than brick, stone, and adobe,
    which are brittle and will break.
-   Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch
    nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal steel beams are used
    to hold down sway.
-   Large buildings can be placed on rollers so that they move with
    the ground.
-   Buildings may be placed on layers of steel and rubber to absorb the
    shock of the waves.
-   Connections, such as where the walls meet the foundation, must be
    made strong.
-   In a multi-story building, the first story must be well supported.

The Transamerica Building in San Francisco, pictured below, rests on a
52-foot deep steel and concrete foundation. Steel rods reinforce the
building internally and X-shaped trusses support it externally. In the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the building shook for more than a minute
and swayed more than 12 inches in each direction, but was not damaged.

### Retrofitting {#6.html#x-ck12-UmV0cm9maXR0aW5n_17-n10}

Older buildings can be made more earthquake safe by **retrofitting** .
Steel or wood can be used to reinforce a building's structure and its
connections. Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retrofitted so
that they do not collapse ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1CcmlkZ2VSZXRyb2ZpdA..) ).

### Preventing Fire Damage {#6.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBGaXJlIERhbWFnZQ.._17-2ce}

Fires often cause more damage than the earthquake. Fires start because
seismic waves rupture gas and electrical lines. Breaks in water mains
make it difficult to fight the fires ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDctNDktU0YtRWFydGhxdWFrZQ..) ). The
shapes of pipes can make a big difference. Straight pipes will break in
a quake. Builders zigzag pipes so that they bend and flex when the
ground shakes. In San Francisco, water and gas pipelines are separated
by valves. Areas can be isolated if one segment breaks.

##### Making Choices {#6.html#x-ck12-TWFraW5nIENob2ljZXM._17-ut8}

Strong, sturdy structures are expensive to build. Communities must
decide how safe to make their buildings. They must weigh how great the
hazard is, what different building strategies will cost, and how much
risk they are willing to take.

**How can you prepare for an earthquake?**

If you live in earthquake country, the actions you take before, during,
and after a quake could make the difference in your comfort for several
days, or even your survival.

### Protecting Yourself in an Earthquake {#6.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVjdGluZyBZb3Vyc2VsZiBpbiBhbiBFYXJ0aHF1YWtl_18-0r7}

There are many things you can do to protect yourself before, during, and
after an earthquake.

#### Before the Earthquake {#6.html#x-ck12-QmVmb3JlIHRoZSBFYXJ0aHF1YWtl_18-vgl}

-   Have an engineer evaluate the house for structural integrity. Make
    sure the separate pieces—floor, walls, roof, and foundation—are all
    well-attached to each other.
-   Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof.
-   Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places.
-   Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom.
-   Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges.
-   Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs
    to lessen fire risk.
-   Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so that
    they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should
    be well-secured.
-   Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line.
-   Prepare an earthquake kit with three days supply of water and food,
    a radio, and batteries.
-   Place flashlights all over the house and in the glove box of
    your car.
-   Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight
    small fires.
-   Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone should know basic first
    aid and CPR.
-   Plan in advance how you will evacuate and where you will go. Do not
    plan on driving, as roadways will likely be damaged.

#### During the Earthquake {#6.html#x-ck12-RHVyaW5nIHRoZSBFYXJ0aHF1YWtl_18-ueh}

-   If you are in a building, get beneath a sturdy table, cover your
    head, and hold on.
-   Stay away from windows, mirrors, and large furniture.
-   If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast
    as possible.
-   If you are outside, run to an open area away from buildings and
    power lines that may fall.
-   If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures
    that might collapse, such as overpasses, bridges, or buildings.

#### After the Earthquake {#6.html#x-ck12-QWZ0ZXIgdGhlIEVhcnRocXVha2U._18-dyn}

-   Be aware that **aftershocks** , smaller quakes that come after the
    main trembler, are likely.
-   Avoid dangerous areas like hillsides that may experience
    a landslide.
-   Turn off water and power to your home.
-   Call 911 only if there is a real emergency. Many people will be
    trying to get through to emergency services.
-   Be prepared to wait for help or instructions. Assist others
    as necessary.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-39r}

-   Before an earthquake, be sure that your home is secure. Be sure that
    you have supplies to last a few days.
-   During an earthquake, get to a safe place.
-   After an earthquake, avoid dangerous situations, wait for
    instructions, and assist as necessary.

**Is Earth the only planet to have volcanoes?**

On Earth, active volcanoes are found on all continents except Australia.
Volcanoes even erupt under the ice on Antarctica! Volcanoes are also
common elsewhere in the solar system. In fact, the biggest volcano is on
Mars. This image is of Olympus Mons, which is a shield volcano. Olympus
Mons is three times the height of Mt. Everest. But its slopes are very
gentle.

### Volcanoes {#6.html#x-ck12-Vm9sY2Fub2Vz_19-ysn}

A volcano is a vent from which the material from a magma chamber
escapes. This may include lava, rock fragments, ash, and gases. Volcanic
eruptions can come from many types of structures. Most people think of
volcanoes as large, peaky cones. But volcanoes can be large and broad,
or tiny little cones. Volcanic eruptions can come from fractured domes,
a vent in the ground, or from a giant hole in the ground.

### Where They Are {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgVGhleSBBcmU._19-chi}

Volcanoes are a vibrant manifestation of plate tectonics processes.
Volcanoes are common along convergent and divergent plate boundaries.
They are also found within lithospheric plates at hotspots. Wherever
mantle is able to melt, volcanoes are likely to be the result.

The Pacific Ocean basin is a good place to look for different types of
volcanoes. The light blue wavy line that goes up the right-center of the
diagram is the East Pacific Rise. The rise is made of volcanoes at a
divergent plate boundary. Trenches due to subduction are on the west and
east sides of the basin. Subduction creates island arcs that are seen in
the Western Pacific. Subduction also creates continental arcs seen along
Central and South America. Hawaii is the line of volcanoes trending
southeast-northwest near the center-top of the image ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMDItRWFzdC1QYWNpZmljLVJpc2U.) ). The
Hawaiian volcanoes are due to a hotspot.

**Figure 6.51**

Volcanoes at divergent plate boundaries are in the East Pacific Rise.
Convergent plate boundaries, where there are trenches, have volcanoes.
Hotspot volcanoes are in chains in the middle of the ocean basin.

</div>

### Creating Magma {#6.html#x-ck12-Q3JlYXRpbmcgTWFnbWE._19-lyq}

Volcanoes erupt because mantle rock melts. This is the first stage in
creating a volcano. How can rock melt? One way is if the temperature
rises. Another way is if the pressure on the rock decreases; this will
lower the rock's melting temperature. The melting temperature of a rock
also goes down if water is added. Every time there is a volcanic
eruption, one or more of these things happens. For each type of volcano
mentioned in these concepts, think about how and why melting occurs.

### Stages {#6.html#x-ck12-U3RhZ2Vz_19-fjc}

**Figure 6.52**

Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct.

</div>

Of all the volcanoes in the world, very few are erupting at any given
time. Scientists question whether a volcano that is not erupting will
ever erupt again and then describe it as active, dormant, or extinct.

-   **Active** : Currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon.
-   **Dormant** : No current activity, but has erupted recently.
-   **Extinct** : No activity for some time; will probably not
    erupt again.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-jn8}

-   Volcanoes are located along convergent and divergent
    plate boundaries. They can be found in the middle of plates at
    hot spots.
-   Magma can be created when temperature rises, pressure lowers, or
    water is added.
-   Volcanoes may be active, dormant, or extinct. This depends on
    whether there is the possibility of magma in their magma chambers.

**What good are plate boundaries?**

Plate boundaries create natural resources, such as gold. But plate
boundaries also create beautiful scenery like mountains. Volcanoes at
convergent plate boundaries can be beautiful to look at. They can also
be beautiful to visit or even climb!

### Convergent Plate Boundaries {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29udmVyZ2VudCBQbGF0ZSBCb3VuZGFyaWVz_20-wey}

Converging plates can be oceanic, continental, or one of each. If at
least one is oceanic, it will subduct. A subducting plate creates
volcanoes. Many of the world's volcanoes are the result of subduction at
a convergent plate boundary. A map of the world's active volcanoes is
pictured below ( **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDgtMDEtTWFw)
).

#### Melting {#6.html#x-ck12-TWVsdGluZw.._20-1f4}

Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature
rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and
(3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1
and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate
boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it
sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting
plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the
overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the
mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes
form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental
arc.

#### Pacific Rim {#6.html#x-ck12-UGFjaWZpYyBSaW0._20-6rx}

Convergent plate boundaries are found around much of the Pacific Ocean
basin. Trenches mark subduction zones. Volcanoes are found in an arc
above those subduction zones.

The Cascades ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1DYXNjYWRlVm9sY2FuaWNBcmM.) ) are a chain
of volcanoes at a convergent boundary. In this region, an oceanic plate
is subducting beneath a continental plate.

### Divergent plate boundaries {#6.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJnZW50IHBsYXRlIGJvdW5kYXJpZXM._20-9qt}

At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where
the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock rises, it goes from
higher to lower pressure. This is because there is no longer the weight
of all the rock above it. Lower pressure lowers the melting temperature
of the rock (2 in the previous section). This is why there is volcanism
at divergent plate boundaries. Lava erupts through long cracks in the
ground, or **fissures.**

#### Mid-Ocean Ridges {#6.html#x-ck12-TWlkLU9jZWFuIFJpZGdlcw.._20-r7b}

Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge.
Seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys. This type
of volcanism makes all of the ocean floor! Where a hotspot is located
along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to
create islands ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JY2VsYW5kVm9sY2Fubw..) ).

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-ai7}

-   Subduction at convergent plate boundaries leads to melting
    and volcanoes.
-   Convergent plate boundaries line the Pacific Ocean basin so that
    volcanic arcs line the region.
-   Melting at divergent plate boundaries is due to release of pressure.
-   At mid-ocean ridges seafloor is pulled apart and new seafloor
    is created. Rifting in a continent can create a new
    ocean eventually.

**What does an intraplate eruption look like?**

The Hawaiian Islands are formed from a hotspot beneath the Pacific
Ocean. Volcanoes grow above the hotspot. Lava flows down the hillsides,
and some of it reaches the ocean, causing the islands to grow. Too hot
now, but a great place in the future for beach lovers!

### Volcanic Hotspots {#6.html#x-ck12-Vm9sY2FuaWMgSG90c3BvdHM._21-08n}

Some volcanoes form over active **hotspots** . Scientists count about 50
hotspots on the Earth. Hotspots lie directly above a column of hot rock
called a **mantle plume** . Mantle plumes continuously bring hot rock up
from the mantle toward the crust ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMDMtbWFudGxlLXBsdW1lcw..) ). The rock
melts due to the release of pressure.

**Figure 6.58**

Mantle plumes are found all over the world, especially in the ocean
basins. The size of the eruptions is different at different plumes.

</div>

Hotspots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. They create
intraplate volcanoes.

#### Hotspots in the Oceans {#6.html#x-ck12-SG90c3BvdHMgaW4gdGhlIE9jZWFucw.._21-xq2}

Hotspots are much more common beneath ocean crust. This is because ocean
crust is thinner. The plume can more easily penetrate this crust. As the
tectonic plates move above a hotspot, they form a chain of volcanoes.
The islands of Hawaii formed over a hotspot in the middle of the Pacific
plate. The volcanoes are massive shield volcanoes that together create
the islands. The lavas are mafic and have low viscosity. These lavas
produce beautiful ropy flows of pāhoehoe and clinkery flows of a'a.
These lava types will be described in more detail in the concept
"Effusive Eruptions."

The Hawaii hotspot has been active for tens of millions of years. The
volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands formed at this hotspot. Older
volcanoes that formed at the hotspot have eroded below sea level. These
are called the Emperor Seamounts.

Loihi seamount is currently active beneath the water southeast of the
Big Island of Hawaii. One day, the volcano will rise above sea level.
Loihi will join the volcanoes of the island or create a new island (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMDQtTG9paGk.) ).

Hotspots may also be active at plate boundaries. This is especially
common at mid-ocean ridges. Iceland is formed by a hotspot along the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

#### Hotspots within Continents {#6.html#x-ck12-SG90c3BvdHMgd2l0aGluIENvbnRpbmVudHM._21-lsw}

Hotspots are found within continents, but not as commonly as within
oceans. They are not common because it takes a massive mantle plume to
penetrate the thick continental crust. Eruptions from these hotspots are
rare but massive. The Yellowstone hotspot is a famous example of a
continental hotspot.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-bqh}

-   Volcanoes grow above hotspots. A hotspot is a zone of melting above
    a mantle plume.
-   Hotspot volcanoes are better able to penetrate oceanic crust than
    continental crust. We see many more hotspot volcanoes in the oceans.
-   Shield volcanoes commonly form above hotspots in the oceans.

**Are all volcanic eruptions alike?**

The type of eruption a volcano has depends on the type of magma in its
chamber. Some eruptions are explosive. Some eruptions are quiet. All
eruptions are amazing!

### Magma {#6.html#x-ck12-TWFnbWE._22-y9w}

Magma forms deep beneath the Earth’s surface. Rock melts below the
surface under tremendous pressure and high temperatures. Molten rock
flows like taffy or hot wax. Most magmas are formed at temperatures
between 600 ^o^ C and 1300 ^o^ C ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NYWdtYUNoYW1iZXI.) ).

**Figure 6.60**

Magma beneath a volcano erupts onto the volcano’s surface. This image is
of a magma chamber underlying Yellowstone.

</div>

Magma collects in **magma chambers** beneath Earth’s surface. Magma
chambers are located where the heat and pressure are great enough to
melt rock. These locations are at divergent or convergent plate
boundaries or at hotpots.

The chemistry of a magma determines the type of igneous rock it forms.
The chemistry also determines how the magma moves. The higher the amount
of silica in the magma, the higher the viscosity. **Viscosity** is a
liquid's resistance to flow. Viscous magmas tend to stay below the
surface or erupt explosively. These are felsic magmas, which are high in
silica. When magma is fluid and runny, it is not viscous. This magma
often reaches the surface by flowing out in rivers of lava. These are
low-silica mafic magmas.

### Lava {#6.html#x-ck12-TGF2YQ.._22-fa2}

The way lava flows depends on what it is made of. Thick lava doesn’t
flow easily. It may block the vent of a volcano. If the lava traps a lot
of gas, the pressure builds up. After the pressure becomes greater and
greater, the volcano finally explodes. Ash and pyroclasts shoot up into
the air. Pumice, with small holes in solid rock, shows where gas bubbles
were when the rock was still molten.

Fluid lava flows down mountainsides. The rock that the flow becomes
depends on which type of lava it is and where it cools. The three types
of flows are a’a, pahoehoe, and pillow lava.

-   A’a lava is the thickest of the non-explosive lavas. A'a forms a
    thick and brittle crust, which is torn into rough, rubbly pieces.
    The solidified surface is angular, jagged, and sharp ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BQUZsb3c.) ). A'a can spread over
    large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath.

**Figure 6.61**

A'a flows can also be found in Hawaii and are much sharper and more
jagged than pahoehoe.

</div>

-   Pāhoehoe lava is thinner than a'a, and flows more readily. Its
    surface looks more wrinkly and smooth. Pāhoehoe lava flows in a
    series of lobes that form strange, twisted shapes and natural rock
    sculptures ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMTAtcGFob2Vob2UtZmxvdw..) ).
    Pāhoehoe lava can form lava tubes. The outer layer of the lava flow
    cools and solidifies. The inner part of the flow remains fluid. The
    fluid lava flows through and leaves behind a tube.

    water ( **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PY2VhbkJhc2FsdA..) ). Once in the
    water, the lava cools very quickly. The lava forms round rocks that
    resemble pillows. Pillow lava is particularly common along
    mid-ocean ridges.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-gc9}

-   Magmas differ in composition, which affects viscosity. Magma
    composition has a large effect on how a volcano erupts.
-   Felsic lavas are more viscous and erupt explosively or do not erupt.
    Mafic lavas are less viscous and erupt effusively.
-   Different lava types create different rock types, such as pahoehoe
    and a'a. Lavas that cool underwater become pillow lavas.

**What would cause a giant explosion like this one?**

The type of eruption a volcano has depends on the composition of the
magma. Silica-rich, felsic magma can trap a lot of gas. So these magmas
produce explosive eruptions. Silica-poor mafic magmas trap little gas.
These magmas produce quiet eruptions. Which type of eruption do you
think is safest to be near?

### Eruptions {#6.html#x-ck12-RXJ1cHRpb25z_23-1iz}

All volcanoes share the same basic features. First, mantle rock melts.
The molten rock collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers
(100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands. The hot
rock is less dense than the surrounding rock. The magma rises toward the
surface through cracks in the crust. A volcanic **eruption** occurs when
the magma reaches the surface. Lava can reach the surface gently or
explosively.

#### Explosive Eruptions {#6.html#x-ck12-RXhwbG9zaXZlIEVydXB0aW9ucw.._23-vkw}

An **explosive eruption** produces huge clouds of volcanic ash. Chunks
of the volcano fly high into the atmosphere. Explosive eruptions can be
tens of thousands of times as powerful as an atomic bomb ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JY2VsYW5kVm9sY2FubzI.) ). Hot magma
beneath the surface mixes with water. This forms gases. The gas pressure
grows until it must be released. The volcano erupts in an enormous
explosion.

**Figure 6.64**

Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland spewed ash into the atmosphere in
2010. This was a fairly small eruption, but it disrupted air travel
across Europe for six days.

</div>

Ash and particles shoot many kilometers into the sky. The material may
form a mushroom cloud, just like a nuclear explosion. Hot fragments of
rock, called **pyroclasts** , fly up into the air at very high speeds.
The pyroclasts cool in the atmosphere. Some ash may stay in the
atmosphere for years. The ash may block out sunlight. This changes
weather patterns and affects the temperature of the Earth. For a year or
two after a large eruption, sunsets may be especially beautiful
worldwide.

Volcanic gases can form poisonous, invisible clouds. The poisonous gases
may be toxic close to the eruption. The gases may cause environmental
problems like acid rain and ozone destruction.

#### Mt. St. Helens {#6.html#x-ck12-TXQuIFN0LiBIZWxlbnM._23-ucq}

In 1980, Mount St. Helens, located between Portland, Oregon and Seattle,
Washington, erupted explosively. The eruption killed 57 people,
destroyed 250 homes, and swept away 47 bridges. The volcano blew off its
top so that it lost over 400 meters (1,300 feet) of height. Mt. St.
Helens is still active ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMDUtTXQtc3QtaGVsZW5z) ). Within the
crater, a new lava dome formed.

acres of trees like they were toothpicks.

</div>

Much of the damage in the eruption was due to pyroclastic flows.
**Pyroclastic flows** of pyroclasts and ash knock down everything in
their path. The temperature inside a pyroclastic flow may be as high as
1,000°C (1,800°F). A pyroclastic flow at Montserrat volcano is seen in
this video:
[http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20files/PyroclasticFlow.MOV](PyroclasticFlow.MOV)
.

**Lahars** are mixtures of ash and water that travel down river valleys.
On Mount St. Helens, the eruption melted glaciers. The water mixed with
ash from the eruption and created tremendous lahars. The lahars raced
down valleys and knocked out many bridges.

Mt St. Helens was not a very large eruption for the Cascades. Mt. Mazama
blew itself apart in an eruption about 42 times more powerful than Mount
St. Helens in 1980. Today all that remains of that huge stratovolcano is
Crater Lake ( **Figure**

**Isn't this an explosive eruption?**

This is a strombolian eruption. This type of eruption was named for Mt.
Stromboli in Italy. Strombolian eruptions spew lava into the air. But
these eruptions do not have a massive explosion. They create lava flows.

### Effusive Eruptions {#6.html#x-ck12-RWZmdXNpdmUgRXJ1cHRpb25z_24-cdp}

Mafic magma creates gentler **effusive eruptions** . There is little or
no gas. The lava is thin and fluid so that it flows over the ground like
a river. Mafic magma pushes toward the surface through fissures.
Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1MYXZhUml2ZXI.) ). Effusive
eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas are mafic.

### Effusive Eruptions Damage {#6.html#x-ck12-RWZmdXNpdmUgRXJ1cHRpb25z_24IERhbWFnZQ..-p6y}

Effusive eruptions rarely kill anyone because they move slowly. People
can usually be evacuated before an effusive eruption. Still, effusive
eruptions can be destructive. There is not much anyone can do to stop a
lava flow from destroying a building or road ( **Figure**

**What is one of the deadliest science jobs?**

No one can predict exactly when a volcanic eruption will take place.
There are clues, but no one knows exactly when. Sometimes a volcano will
erupt when scientists are studying it. Volcanologists have a high
fatality rate among scientists because forecasting eruptions is so
difficult.

### Predicting Volcanic Eruptions {#6.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGljdGluZyBWb2xjYW5pYyBFcnVwdGlvbnM._25-acx}

Volcanic eruptions can be devastating, particularly to the people who
live close to volcanoes. Volcanologists study volcanoes to be able to
predict when a volcano will erupt. Many changes happen when a volcano is
about to erupt. Even so, eruptions are very difficult to predict.

#### History of Volcanic Activities {#6.html#x-ck12-SGlzdG9yeSBvZiBWb2xjYW5pYyBBY3Rpdml0aWVz_25-fia}

Scientists study a volcano’s history to try to predict when it will next
erupt. They want to know how long it has been since it last erupted.
They also want to know the time span between its previous eruptions.
Scientists watch both active and dormant volcanoes closely for signs
that show they might erupt.

**Figure 6.70**

Mount Rainier in Washington State is currently dormant. The volcano
could, and probably will erupt again.

</div>

#### Earthquakes {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGhxdWFrZXM._25-jkv}

Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an
eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the
result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion
causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground
shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano
is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and
strength of each earthquake.

#### Slope Tilt {#6.html#x-ck12-U2xvcGUgVGlsdA.._25-jgv}

All that magma and gas pushing upward can make the volcano’s slope begin
to swell. Ground swelling may change the shape of a volcano or cause
rock falls and landslides. Most of the time, the ground tilting is not
visible. Scientists detect it by using tiltmeters, which are instruments
that measure the angle of the slope of a volcano.

#### Gases {#6.html#x-ck12-R2FzZXM._25-qjv}

Scientists measure the gases that escape from a volcano to predict
eruptions. Gases like sulfur dioxide (SO ~2~ ), carbon dioxide (CO ~2~
), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and water vapor can be measured at the site.
Gases may also be measured from satellites. The amounts of gases and the
ratios of gases are calculated to help predict eruptions.

#### Remote Monitoring {#6.html#x-ck12-UmVtb3RlIE1vbml0b3Jpbmc._25-vjf}

Satellites can be used to monitor more than just gases ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMTQtcmVtb3RlLW1vbml0b3Jpbmc.) ).
Satellites can look for high temperature spots or areas where the
volcano surface is changing. This allows scientists to detect changes
accurately and safely.

### Costs and Benefits of Predictions {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29zdHMgYW5kIEJlbmVmaXRzIG9mIFByZWRpY3Rpb25z_25-jdb}

No scientist or government agency wants to announce an eruption and then
be wrong. There is a very real cost and disruption to society during a
large-scale evacuation. If the scientists are wrong, people would be
less likely to evacuate the next time scientists predicted an eruption.
But if scientists predict an eruption that does take place, it could
save many lives.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-jkd}

-   Volcanologists use several lines of evidence to try to forecast
    volcanic eruptions.
-   Magma moving beneath a volcano will cause earthquakes and
    slope deformation. Gases may be released from the magma out of the
    volcano vent.
-   Deciding whether to call for an evacuation is very tricky.

**What does an active volcano look like?**

Climbing up Mount St. Helens and looking into the crater at the steaming
dome is an incredible experience. The slope is steep and the landscape
is like something from another planet. Nothing's alive up there, except
maybe a bird. When you're standing on the top, you can see other
Cascades volcanoes: Mt. Adams, Rainier, Hood, Jefferson, and sometimes
more.

### Volcanoes {#6.html#x-ck12-Vm9sY2Fub2Vz_26-7jg}

A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a
magma chamber. Volcanoes differ in many features, such as height, shape,
and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones, and others are just
cracks in the ground ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NdEZ1amk.) ). As you might expect, the
shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma. The three
types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones.

#### Composite Volcanoes {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG9zaXRlIFZvbGNhbm9lcw.._26-4df}

Mt. Fuji is a well-known composite volcano.

</div>

**Figure** [above](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NdEZ1amk.) shows Mt. Fuji,
a classic example of a composite volcano. **Composite volcanoes** have
broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater
at the top. The crater was created during the volcano's last eruption.

Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because
they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash (
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdHJhdG92b2xjYW5v) ). The
magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep
sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick
magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into
the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This
creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. The composition of magma
that erupts at composite volcanoes is usually felsic (rhyolite) or
intermediate (andesite).

**Figure 6.73**

Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a
tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed
for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite
volcanoes.

**Shield volcanoes** look like a huge ancient warrior’s shield laid
down. Pictured above is Mauna Kea Volcano ( **Figure**
[above](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1LaWxhdWVhU2hpZWxk) ) taken from Mauna
Loa Volcano. Both volcanoes are part of the Big Island of Hawaii. A
shield volcano has a very wide base. It is much flatter on the top than
a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is
relatively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, flat
volcano, layer by layer. The composition of lava at shield volcanoes is
mafic. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa
Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The
volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of
nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its
base on the seafloor.

Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also
form at hotspots, like Hawaii. Shield volcano eruptions are
non-explosive.

This *Volcanoes 101* video from National Geographic discusses where
volcanoes are found and what their properties come from:

#### Cinder Cones {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2luZGVyIENvbmVz_26-1xx}

**Cinder cones** are the smallest and most common type of volcano.
Cinder cones have steep sides like composite volcanoes. But they are
much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height. Cinder cones
usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small
fragments of rock, called cinders. The cinders are piled on top of one
another. The cinders can be mafic, intermediate, or felsic in
composition. These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava.
Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes. Most composite and shield
volcanoes have nearby cinder cones.

Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly. They only erupt for a short
time. Many only produce one eruption. For this reason, cinder cones do
not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMTktY2luZGVyLWNvbmU.) ).

**Is this a supervolcano?**

Lake Toba in Indonesia is 100 km (62 mi) by 30 km (19 mi). The water
fills a giant caldera created by a supervolcano. The eruption took place
about 75,000 years ago, Earth's largest eruption in the past 25 million
years. So much material was ejected into space that there was a 6- to
10-year volcanic winter. Some scientists think that only 10,000 humans
survived worldwide. The numbers of other mammals also plummeted.

### Calderas {#6.html#x-ck12-Q2FsZGVyYXM._27-dt2}

During a massive eruption, all of the material may be ejected from a
magma changer. Without support, the mountain above the empty chamber may
collapse. This produces a huge **caldera** . Calderas are generally
round, bowl-shaped formations ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMjAtY2FsZGVyYQ..) ).

### Supervolcanoes {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJ2b2xjYW5vZXM._27-yh0}

**Supervolcano** eruptions are extremely rare in Earth's history. It’s a
good thing because they are unimaginably large. A supervolcano must
erupt more than 1,000 cubic km (240 cubic miles) of material. Imagine
how large that is compared with 1.2 km ^3^ for Mount St. Helens. Mount
Pinatubo, a large eruption in the Philippines in 1991, erupted only 25

dangerous type of volcano.

#### Supervolcano Eruptions {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJ2b2xjYW5vIEVydXB0aW9ucw.._27-wvs}

The exact cause of supervolcano eruptions is still debated. However,
scientists think that a very large magma chamber erupts entirely in one
catastrophic explosion. This creates a caldera into which the surface
collapses ( **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA4MDMtMDY.) ).
The composition of the eruption is felsic or highly felsic.

#### Yellowstone Caldera {#6.html#x-ck12-WWVsbG93c3RvbmUgQ2FsZGVyYQ.._27-ywn}

The largest supervolcano in North America is beneath Yellowstone
National Park in Wyoming. Much of the national park lies within the
enormous Yellowstone Caldera. It is so large that you can stand on one
rim and not see the other side.

What would cause such a giant caldera?

</div>

Yellowstone sits above a hotspot that has erupted catastrophically three
times: 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 640,000 years ago. Yellowstone has
produced many smaller (but still enormous) eruptions more recently (
**Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDgtMzEtWWVsbG93c3RvbmUtQ2FsZGVyYQ..) ).
Fortunately, current activity at Yellowstone is limited to the region’s
famous geysers. No one knows when the supervolcano will erupt again.

### Supervolcano Eruptions and Life on Earth {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJ2b2xjYW5vIEVydXB0aW9ucyBhbmQgTGlmZSBvbiBFYXJ0aA.._27-yhe}

A supervolcano could change life on Earth as we know it. Ash could block
sunlight so much that photosynthesis would be reduced and global
temperatures would plummet. Volcanic eruptions could have contributed to
some of the mass extinctions in our planet’s history. No one knows when
the next super eruption will be.

Interesting volcano videos are seen on National Geographic Videos,
Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Earthquakes:
[http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/environment/]() . The
video, “Mammoth Mountain,” is particularly interesting; it explores Hot
Creek and the volcanic area it is a part of in California.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-vgf}

-   A caldera forms after a massive eruption. The top of the volcano
    collapses, forming a basin.
-   Supervolcano eruptions are rare but massive and deadly.
-   Yellowstone Caldera is a supervolcano that has erupted
    catastropically three times.
-   Supervolcano eruptions can change the course of life on Earth.

**Why does this massive rock stick out like this?**

Shiprock in New Mexico is visible for many miles around. Shiprock is the
neck of an old volcano. The magma cooled into a rock that was harder
than the surrounding volcano. So the volcano eroded away and left the
neck. The peak is on the land of the Navajo Nation, for whom it has
great religious significance.

### Landforms from Lava {#6.html#x-ck12-TGFuZGZvcm1zIGZyb20gTGF2YQ.._28-imw}

Extrusive igneous rocks cool at the surface. Volcanoes are one type of
feature that forms from extrusive rocks. Several other interesting
landforms are also extrusive features. Intrusive igneous rocks cool
below the surface. These rocks do not always remain hidden. Rocks that
formed in the crust are exposed when the rock and sediment that covers
them is eroded away.

#### Volcanoes and Vents {#6.html#x-ck12-Vm9sY2Fub2VzIGFuZCBWZW50cw.._28-gx1}

The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes. These are
mostly cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes.
Eruptions also take place through other types of vents, commonly from
fissures ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDgtMzMtZmlzc3VyZS1lcnVwdGlvbg..) ). The
eruptions that created the entire ocean floor are essentially fissure
eruptions.

#### Lava Domes {#6.html#x-ck12-TGF2YSBEb21lcw.._28-weo}

When lava is thick, it flows slowly. If thick lava makes it to the
surface, it cannot flow far from the vent. It often stays right in the
middle of a crater at the top of a volcano. Here the lava creates a
large, round **lava dome** ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Nb25vQ3JhdGVy) ).

#### Lava Plateaus {#6.html#x-ck12-TGF2YSBQbGF0ZWF1cw.._28-nsz}

A **lava plateau** is made of a large amount of fluid lava. The lava
flows over a large area and cools. This creates a large, flat surface of
igneous rock. Lava plateaus may be huge. The Columbia Plateau covers
over 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles). It makes up parts
of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDgtMzYtQ29sdW1iaWEtUGxhdGV1YQ..) ).

#### Land {#6.html#x-ck12-TGFuZA.._28-x2f}

New land is created in volcanic eruptions. The Hawaiian Islands are
shield volcanoes. These volcanoes formed from fluid lava ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMjItSGF3YWlpYW4tSXNsYW5kcw..) ). The
island grows as lava is added on the coast. New land may also emerge
from lava that erupts from beneath the water. This is one way that new
land is created.

### Landforms from Magma {#6.html#x-ck12-TGFuZGZvcm1zIGZyb20gTWFnbWE._28-8xw}

Magma that cools underground forms **intrusions** ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDgtMjMtaW50cnVzaW9ucw..) ). Usually this
magma is very viscous felsic magma. This magma does not rise easily and
so cools slowly underground. Intrusions become land formations if they
are exposed at the surface by uplift and erosion.

**Hot spring, anyone?**

Hot water from underground can pool at hot springs. Even some animals
enjoy relaxing in nature's hot tubs. Care to join them?

### Hot Springs and Geysers {#6.html#x-ck12-SG90IFNwcmluZ3MgYW5kIEdleXNlcnM._29-fns}

Water sometimes comes into contact with hot rock. The water may emerge
at the surface as either a hot spring or a geyser.

#### Hot Springs {#6.html#x-ck12-SG90IFNwcmluZ3M._29-qdc}

When hot water gently rises to the surface, it creates a **hot spring**
. A hot spring forms where a crack in the Earth allows water to reach
the surface after being heated underground. Many hot springs are used by
people and animals as natural hot tubs ( **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1ZZWxsb3dzdG9uZVNwcmluZ0Jpc29u) ). Some
people believe that hot springs can cure illnesses. Hot springs are
found all over the world, even in Antarctica!

Even in winter, the water in this hot spring in Yellowstone doesn't
freeze. Bison move near hot springs to escape the extreme cold.

</div>

#### Geysers {#6.html#x-ck12-R2V5c2Vycw.._29-rut}

**Geysers** are also created by water that is heated beneath the Earth’s
surface. The water may become superheated by magma. It becomes trapped
in a narrow passageway. The heat and pressure build as more water is
added. When the pressure is too much, the superheated water bursts out
onto the surface. This is a **geyser** .

There are only a few areas in the world where the conditions are right
for the formation of geysers. Only about 1,000 geysers exist worldwide.
About half of them are in the United States. The most famous geyser is
Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park. The geyser erupts every 60 to
70 minutes, shooting hot water nearly 60 meters in the air. It is rare
for a geyser to erupt so regularly, which is why Old Faithful is famous.
Castle Geyser ( **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTA4MDQtMDY.)
) is another geyser at Yellowstone Park; however, it does not erupt as
frequently or predictably as Old Faithful.

-   When magma heats groundwater, it may come to the surface as a hot
    spring or a geyser.
-   Geysers erupt because the water is trapped. The water becomes
    superheated until finally the pressure builds enough for it to break

## Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-3oy}

Plate tectonic processes explain why we see many types of geological
activity where we do. Stresses build up in some locations. These
stresses may cause folding or faulting. Earthquakes strike along all
three types of plate boundaries. The most damaging earthquakes are
shallow focus. People in earthquake-prone regions must be aware of the
potential damage from earthquakes. Seismologists have scales for
measuring earthquake intensity and magnitude. Cities in earthquake zones
must build safe structures. They also have guidelines for being safe in
earthquakes. Earthquakes are often associated with volcanoes. Volcanoes
erupt at all types of plate boundaries except transform. Volcanic
eruptions can be quiet or explosive. Volcanoes have a variety of shapes.
The shapes range from large shields, to classic peaks, to small cones.
Supervolcano eruptions are rare but extremely deadly. Volcanic activity
creates unique landforms. Hot springs and geysers result when water
meets hot rock below ground. Some geological activity, both earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions, is located away from plate boundaries.

**How does Earth's water move?**

When astronauts see Earth from space, this is how it looks. Notice how
blue the planet appears. That’s because oceans cover much of Earth’s
surface. The water in those oceans is in constant motion. Water is also
found in the clouds that rise above the planet and travel across the
sky. The water may precipitate out as rain or snow. Water passes through
soil and into groundwater. Or it is taken up by the leaves of plants and
then enters the atmosphere. Water moves into and out of animals. Water
may remain as ice in a glacier for thousands of years. This chapter is
about Earth's most dynamic substance: water.

**Where is Earth's Water?**

Here's a photo of Earth from space again. It's pretty easy to see where
most of Earth's water is. It's in the oceans. Nearly all of Earth's
water is in the seas. Although it's extremely useful for ocean
ecosystems, it's not very useful for people. So where is the water that
we can use?

### Where Is Earth’s Freshwater? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgSXMgRWFydGjigJlzIEZyZXNod2F0ZXI_-h7l}

Most of Earth’s water is salt water in the oceans. As seen below, only 3
percent of Earth’s water is fresh ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDItV29ybGRzLVdhdGVyLURpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbg..)
). **Freshwater** is water that contains little or no dissolved salt.
Most freshwater is frozen in ice caps and glaciers. Glaciers cover the
peaks of some tall mountains. For example, the Cascades Mountains in
North America and the Alps Mountains in Europe are capped with ice. Ice
caps cover vast areas of Antarctica and Greenland. Chunks of ice
frequently break off ice caps. They form icebergs that float in the
oceans.

**Figure 7.1**

What percentage of Earth’s surface freshwater is water vapor in the air?

</div>

Only a tiny fraction of Earth’s freshwater is in the liquid state. Most
liquid freshwater is under the ground in layers of rock. Of freshwater
on the surface, the majority occurs in lakes and soil. What percentage
of freshwater on the surface is found in living things?

Water can remain in a particular location for a long time. This is known
as a **reservoir** . Reservoirs for water include oceans, glaciers,
ponds, or even the atmosphere. A water molecule may pass through a
reservoir very quickly or may remain for much longer. The amount of time
a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its **residence time** . The
residence time of water in the ocean is 3,200 years. Of course, not
every molecule stays that long. That number is an average for all
molecules.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-6pk}

-   Of Earth's water, 97% is in the oceans.
-   Of the remaining 3%, much is trapped in ice and glaciers.
-   A substance is stored in a reservoir. The amount of time it stays in
    that reservoir is its residence time.

**What are the three states of water in this photo?**

Water is present as liquid, solid, and gas in this photo. We take water
for granted here on Earth because there is a lot of it!

### The Water Molecule {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFdhdGVyIE1vbGVjdWxl_1-cxo}

A molecule of water ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1XYXRlck1vbGVjdWxl) ) is made of three
atoms bonded together. Two of these atoms are hydrogen and one atom is
oxygen. The hydrogen ions have a positive electrical charge. The oxygen
atom has a negative electrical charge. The hydrogen atoms are located on
one side and the oxygen atom on the other. This means that the side with
the hydrogen ions has a slightly positive charge. The other side, the
side without the hydrogen ions, has a slightly negative charge. The
water molecule is a **polar molecule** .

<div id="7.html#x-ck12-NjFhZmJhZmI1ZGYwYjQ3MjllMmNkYzRmODFiYjkxMWE.-tq7"

</div>

Water has remarkable properties. Water expands when it freezes, even
though all other substances contract. This means that in the winter ice
on a pond or lake will float. Water has high surface tension because
polar molecules tend to stick together. That's why drops stick together
or some bugs can walk on the surface of a pond. Without water, life
might not be able to exist on Earth. If it did exist, it would not be as
diverse or as complex.

### Three States of Matter {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhyZWUgU3RhdGVzIG9mIE1hdHRlcg.._1-wj7}

Water is the only substance on Earth that is present in all three states
of matter. This means that water is present as a solid, liquid, and gas.
Earth is the only planet where water is present in all three states. All
three phases may be present in a single location or in a region. The
three phases are solid (ice or snow), liquid (water), and gas ( **water
vapor** ). See ice, water, and clouds pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XYXRlclN0YXRlc0NvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) ).

**Where have these water molecules been?**

Did you ever wonder where the water molecules you drink came from? Were
some of the molecules trapped in a glacier? Flowing along the bottom of
the ocean? Up high in a thundercloud? Maybe a water molecule that you
drink today once quenched the thirst of a dinosaur. It's all entirely
possible.

### The Water Cycle {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFdhdGVyIEN5Y2xl_2-blh}

The **water cycle** ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDMtV2F0ZXItQ3ljbGU.) ) is the
movement of water through the oceans, atmosphere, land, and living
things. The water cycle is powered by energy from the Sun.

**Figure 7.4**

The water cycle has no beginning or end. Water just keeps moving along.

</div>

Water keeps cycling. The water cycle repeats over and over again. Each
water molecule has probably been around for billions of years. That’s
because Earth’s water is constantly recycled.

#### Processes in the Water Cycle {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJvY2Vzc2VzIGluIHRoZSBXYXRlciBDeWNsZQ.._2-9ab}

Water keeps changing state as it goes through the water cycle. This
means that it can be a solid, liquid, or gas. How does water change
state? How does it keep moving through the cycle? As seen above (
**Figure** [above](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDMtV2F0ZXItQ3ljbGU.) ),
several processes are involved.

-   **Evaporation** changes liquid water to water vapor. Energy from the
    Sun causes water to evaporate. Most evaporation is from the oceans
    because they cover so much area. The water vapor rises into
    the atmosphere.
-   **Transpiration** is like evaporation because it changes liquid
    water to water vapor. In transpiration, plants release water vapor
    through their leaves ( **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UcmFuc3BpcmF0aW9u) ). This water
    vapor rises into the atmosphere.

**Figure 7.5**

Liquid water is taken up by plant roots. The plant releases water vapor
into the atmosphere. This is transpiration.

</div>

-   **Condensation** changes water vapor to liquid water. As air rises
    higher into the atmosphere, it cools. Cool air can hold less water
    vapor than warm air. So some of the water vapor condenses into

A bottle that comes out of the refrigerator is cold. It cools the air
near the bottle. Cooler air can hold less water so water vapor condenses

-   **Precipitation** is water that falls from clouds to
    Earth’s surface. Water droplets in clouds fall to Earth when they
    become too large to stay aloft. The water falls as rain if the air
    is warm. If the air is cold, the water may freeze and fall as snow,
    sleet, or hail. Most precipitation falls into the oceans. Some falls
    on land.
-   **Runoff** is precipitation that flows over the surface of the land.
    This water may travel to a river, lake, or ocean. Runoff may pick up
    fertilizer and other pollutants and deliver them to a water body. In
    this way, runoff may pollute bodies of water.
-   **Infiltration** is the process by which water soaks into
    the ground. Some of the water may seep deep underground. Some may
    stay in the soil, where plants can absorb it with their roots.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-xvi}

-   The water cycle recognizes all of the reservoirs of water. It also
    describes the processes that carry water between the reservoirs.
-   Water changes state by evaporation, condensation, and sublimation.
-   Plants release water through their leaves by transpiration.

### Water Consumption {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgQ29uc3VtcHRpb24._3-efa}

Humans use six times as much water today as they did 100 years ago.
People living in developed countries use a far greater proportion of the
world’s water than people in less developed countries. What do people
use all of that water for?

### How We Use Water {#7.html#x-ck12-SG93IFdlIFVzZSBXYXRlcg.._3-s3s}

The image below shows how people use water worldwide ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjEtMDEtZ2xvYmFsLXdhdGVyLXVzZQ..) ). The
greatest use is for agriculture and then industry. Municipal use is
last, but it is also important. Municipal use refers to water used by
homes and businesses in communities.

**Figure 7.7**

In this global water use chart, see how much is used in agriculture. Why
do you think so much water is used in agriculture?

</div>

#### Agriculture {#7.html#x-ck12-QWdyaWN1bHR1cmU._3-vhy}

Many crops are grown where there isn’t enough rainfall for plants to
thrive. For example, crops are grown in deserts of the American
Southwest. How is this possible? The answer is irrigation.
**Irrigation** is any way of providing extra water to plants. Most of
the water used in agriculture is used for irrigation. Livestock also use
water, but they use much less.

Irrigation can waste a lot of water. The type of irrigation pictured
below ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PdmVyaGVhcmRJcnJpZ2F0aW9u) ) is the
most wasteful. The water is sprayed into the air and then falls to the
ground. But much of the water never reaches the crops. Instead, it
evaporates in the air or runs off the fields. Irrigation water may cause
other problems. The water may dissolve agricultural chemicals such as
pesticides. When the water soaks into the ground, the dissolved
chemicals do too. They may enter groundwater or run off into rivers or
lakes. Salts in irrigation water can also collect in the soil. The soil
may get too salty for plants to grow.

**Figure 7.8**

Overhead irrigation systems like this one are widely used to irrigate
crops on big farms. What are some drawbacks of irrigation?

</div>

#### Industry {#7.html#x-ck12-SW5kdXN0cnk._3-gyz}

Almost a quarter of the water used worldwide is used in industry.
Industries use water for many purposes. Chemical processes need a lot of
water. Water is used to generate electricity. An important way that
industries use water is to cool machines and power plants.

#### Household Uses {#7.html#x-ck12-SG91c2Vob2xkIFVzZXM._3-zy7}

Think about all the ways people use water at home. Besides drinking it,
they use it for cooking, bathing, washing dishes, doing laundry, and
flushing toilets. The water used inside homes goes down the drain. From
there it usually ends up in a sewer system. At the sewage treatment
plant, water is treated and prepared for reuse.

Households may also use water outdoors. If your family has a lawn or
garden, you may water them with a hose or sprinkler. You probably use
water to wash the car ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DYXJXYXNoaW5n) ). Much of the water
used outdoors evaporates or runs off into the gutter. The runoff water
may end up in storm sewers that flow into a body of water, such as the
ocean.

#### Fun {#7.html#x-ck12-RnVu_3-us7}

Fun wasn't on the pie chart ( **Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjEtMDEtZ2xvYmFsLXdhdGVyLXVzZQ..) ), but
it's important, too! There are many ways to use water for fun, from
white water rafting to snorkeling. When you do these activities, you
don’t actually use water. You are doing the activity on or in the water.
What do you think is the single biggest use of water for fun? Believe it
or not, it’s golf! Keeping golf courses green uses an incredible amount
of water. Since many golf courses are in sunny areas, much of the water
is irrigation water. Like any similar sprinkler system, much of this
water is wasted. It evaporates or runs off the ground.

#### Environment {#7.html#x-ck12-RW52aXJvbm1lbnQ._3-q3v}

It's important to leave some water for the environment. In some places,
water is used for wildlife habitat. Man-made lakes create places for
fish and water birds. Leaving water in the ecosystems keeps the
environment good for many species of plants and animals.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-2xo}

-   People use water for agriculture, industry, and consumption.
-   Water can also be used for fun and for the environment.
-   Some water must remain in the environment to support ecosystems.

**What do you have to do to get water?**

In the developed world, we just open a tap. Clean water is available all
the time. In many developing regions, women have to walk long distances
to get clean water. Sometimes there isn't a source of clean water, and
they just get what they can find. We take water for granted in the
developed world.

### Water Problems: Not Enough Water {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgUHJvYmxlbXM6IE5vdCBFbm91Z2ggV2F0ZXI._4-7yj}

Most Americans have plenty of fresh, clean water. But many people around
the world do not. In fact, water scarcity is the world’s most serious
resource problem. How can that be? Water is almost everywhere. But much
of it is unusable. What is usable is not always where it is needed.

#### Where Is All the Water? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgSXMgQWxsIHRoZSBXYXRlcj8._4-2px}

One problem is that only a tiny fraction of Earth’s water is fresh,
liquid water that people can use. More than 97 percent of Earth’s water
is salt water in the oceans. Just 3% is freshwater. Most of the
freshwater is frozen in ice sheets, icebergs, and glaciers ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbGFjaWVyQW5kQ3J1aXNlU2hpcA..) ).

</div>

#### Rainfall and the Water Supply {#7.html#x-ck12-UmFpbmZhbGwgYW5kIHRoZSBXYXRlciBTdXBwbHk._4-xil}

Rainfall varies around the globe. About 40% of the land gets very little
rain. About the same percentage of the world’s people don’t have enough
water. You can compare global rainfall with the worldwide freshwater
supply at the two URLs below. Drier climates generally have less water
for people to use. In some places, people may have less water available
to them for an entire year than many Americans use in a single day! How
much water is there where you live?

-   Freshwater supply:
    [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2006\_Global\_Water\_Availability.svg](File:2006_Global_Water_Availability.svg)

#### Wealth and the Water Supply {#7.html#x-ck12-V2VhbHRoIGFuZCB0aGUgV2F0ZXIgU3VwcGx5_4-hgy}

Richer nations can drill deep wells, build large dams, or supply people
with water in other ways. In these countries, just about everyone has
access to clean running water in their homes, and water is cheap and
easy to get. It’s no surprise that people in these countries use the
most water. In poorer nations, there is little money to develop water
supplies. Therefore, people get their water where they can.

#### Water Shortages {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgU2hvcnRhZ2Vz_4-teq}

Water shortages are common in much of the world. People are most likely
to run short of water during droughts. A **drought** is a period of
unusually low rainfall. Human actions have increased how often droughts
occur. One way people can help to bring on a drought is by cutting down
trees. Trees add a lot of water vapor to the air. With fewer trees, the
air is drier and droughts are more common.

We already use six times as much water today as we did a hundred years
ago. As the number of people rises, our need for water will grow. By the
year 2025, only half the world’s people will have enough clean water.
Water is such a vital resource that serious water shortages may cause
other problems.

-   Crops and livestock may die, so people will have less
    food available.
-   Other uses of water, such as industry, may have to stop. This
    reduces the jobs people can get and the products they can buy.
-   People and nations may fight over water resources.
-   In extreme cases, people may die from lack of water.

shows the global water situation in the 2030s with water stress and
water scarcity on the map.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-pgv}

-   Fresh water is not evenly distributed across the planet.
-   Many of the world's people live without access to enough
    clean water. That percentage is likely to increase as
    populations grow.
-   During a drought, life may become very hard for many people.

The Ganges River is sacred to the people of India. It is also a major
source of water for drinking and bathing for millions of people. An
estimated 400 million people are affected by pollution in the Ganges.

### Water Safety {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgU2FmZXR5_5-iro}

The water Americans get from their faucets is safe. This water has been
treated and purified. At least 20% of the world’s people do not have
clean drinking water always available. That's more than 1 billion
people. They must drink water from where they can get it. Maybe straight
from a river or pond ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjEtMDgtZHJpbmtpbmctd2F0ZXI.) ). Human
wastes may be in the water. If that's the case, the water will probably
contain pathogens. **Pathogens** are organisms that cause diseases.

The photos above are of water being wasted. Water being used for
irrigation with much flying into the air. A large fountain in the
desert. Excess water being used to wash a car. These sorts of waste
occur all the time. How can these activities be done without so much
waste? How can irrigation or car washing use less water? What can people
enjoy in the desert that doesn't involve so much water?

### Conserving Water {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmluZyBXYXRlcg.._6-x0a}

Conserving water means using less of it. Of course, this mostly applies
to people in the wealthy nations that have the most water and also waste
the most.

#### Saving Water in Irrigation {#7.html#x-ck12-U2F2aW5nIFdhdGVyIGluIElycmlnYXRpb24._6-jdk}

**Irrigation** is the single biggest use of water. Overhead irrigation
wastes a lot of water. **Drip irrigation** ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1EcmlwSXJyaWdhdGlvbg..) ) wastes a lot
less. Water pipes run over the surface of the ground. Tiny holes in the
pipes are placed close to each plant. Water slowly drips out of the
holes and soaks into the soil around the plants. Very little of the
water evaporates or runs off the ground.

The above is a drip irrigation system. Look at the soil in the photo.
It’s damp around each plant but dry everywhere else.

</div>

#### Rationing Water {#7.html#x-ck12-UmF0aW9uaW5nIFdhdGVy_6-tcs}

Some communities save water with rationing. Much rationing takes place
only during times of drought. During rationing, water may not be used
for certain things. For example, communities may ban lawn watering and
car washing. People may be fined if they use water in these ways. You
can do your part. Follow any bans where you live.

#### Saving Water at Home {#7.html#x-ck12-U2F2aW5nIFdhdGVyIGF0IEhvbWU._6-4de}

It’s easy to save water at home. If you save even a few gallons a day
you can make a big difference in the long run. The best place to start
saving water is in the bathroom. Toilet flushing is the single biggest
use of water in the home. Showers and baths are the next biggest use.
Follow the tips below to save water at home.

-   Install water-saving toilets. They use only about half as much water
    per flush. A single household can save up to 20,000 gallons a year
    with this change alone!
-   Remember what they say about bathroom flushing in California during
    rationing: If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it
    down!
-   Take shorter showers. You can get just as clean in five minutes as
    you can in 10. And you’ll save up to 50 gallons of water each time
    you shower. That’s thousands of gallons each year.
-   Use low-flow shower heads. They use about half as much water as
    regular shower heads. They save thousands of gallons of water.
-   Fix leaky shower heads and faucets. All those drips really add up.
    At one drip per second, more than 6,000 gallons go down the drain in
    a year—per faucet!
-   Don’t leave the water running while you brush your teeth. You could
    save as much as 10 gallons each time you brush. That could add up to
    7,000 gallons in a year.
-   Landscape your home with plants that need little water. This could
    result in a huge savings in water use. Look at the garden pictured
    below ( **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjEtMTktbG93LXdhdGVyLWdhcmRlbg..) );
    it shows that you don’t have to sacrifice beauty to save water.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-byj}

-   Drip irrigation uses much less water than other methods.
-   People can reduce water consumption by taking shorter showers,
    installing water-saving devices, and many other methods.
-   Communities sometimes ration water during times of drought.

**What makes this river so much fun to raft?**

Whitewater rafting is a popular recreational activity. The river is fast
because its in the mountains traveling downhill. There is a lot of water
from snow melt higher up. Sometimes water is added from springs. Did you
ever go whitewater rafting? It's fun!

### What Are Streams and Rivers? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgU3RyZWFtcyBhbmQgUml2ZXJzPw.._7-uxi}

A **stream** is a body of freshwater that flows downhill in a channel.
The channel of a stream has a bottom, or bed, and sides called banks.
Any size body of flowing water can be called a stream. Usually, though,
a large stream is called a **river** .

#### Features of Streams and Rivers {#7.html#x-ck12-RmVhdHVyZXMgb2YgU3RyZWFtcyBhbmQgUml2ZXJz_7-m96}

All streams and rivers have several features in common ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDUtUml2ZXItRmVhdHVyZXM.) ). The
place where a stream or river starts is its **source** . The source
might be a spring, where water flows out of the ground. Or the source
might be water from melting snow on a mountain top, like the stream
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbGFjaWVyTmF0aW9uYWxQYXJrUml2ZXI.) ).
A single stream may have multiple sources.

river](ck12_7_files/20150911025801775961.jpeg "Diagram of the features of a river")

**Figure 7.18**

Water in a stream flows along the ground from higher to lower elevation.
What force causes the water to keep flowing?

</div>

A stream or river probably ends when it flows into a body of water, such
as a lake or an ocean. A stream ends at its **mouth** . As the water
flows into the body of water, it slows down and drops the sediment it
was carrying. The sediment may build up to form a delta.

Several other features of streams and rivers are also shown above (
**Figure** [above](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDUtUml2ZXItRmVhdHVyZXM.)
).

-   Small streams often flow into bigger streams or rivers. The small
    streams are called **tributaries** . A river and all its tributaries
    make up a river system.
-   At certain times of year, a stream or river may overflow its banks.
    The area of land that is flooded is called the **floodplain** . The
    floodplain may be very wide where the river flows over a nearly
    flat surface.
-   A river flowing over a floodplain may wear away broad curves. These
    curves are called **meanders** . Pictured below is an example of
    this ( **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb3V0aENhcm9saW5hRXN0dWFyeQ..) ).

#### River Basins and Divides {#7.html#x-ck12-Uml2ZXIgQmFzaW5zIGFuZCBEaXZpZGVz_7-dt6}

All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or
**watershed** . One river system’s basin is separated from another river
system’s basin by a **divide** . The divide is created by the highest
points between the two river basins. Precipitation that falls within a
river basin always flows toward that river. Precipitation that falls on
the other side of the divide flows toward a different river. A
**continental divide** separates rivers that flow into different oceans.

Pictured below are the major river basins in the U.S. ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1VU1JpdmVyQmFzaW5z) ).

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-hnw}

-   A moving body of water of any size is a stream. A river is a
    large stream.
-   A tributary begins at its headwaters on one side of a divide. Two
    tributaries come together at a confluence.
-   A river ends at an estuary. If the river drops sediment, it may
    create a delta.

**Why are lakes important?**

Lakes are important habitats for lots of plants and animals. The slow
motions of the water are easier for organisms to live in than the water
from rapidly moving streams. Some animals live on land but get at least
part of their food from lakes or ponds. This eagle is fishing for its
meal. What would happen if lakes dried up?

### Ponds and Lakes {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9uZHMgYW5kIExha2Vz_8-nyd}

After a heavy rain, you may find puddles of water standing in low spots.
The same principle explains why water collects in ponds and lakes. Water
travels downhill, so a depression in the ground fills with standing
water. A **pond** is a small body of standing water. A **lake** is a
large body of standing water. Most lakes have freshwater, but a few are
salty. The Great Salt Lake in Utah is an example of a saltwater lake.

The water in a large lake may be so deep that sunlight cannot penetrate
all the way to the bottom. Without sunlight, water plants and algae
cannot live on the bottom of the lake. That’s because plants need
sunlight for photosynthesis.

#### Water in Ponds and Lakes {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgaW4gUG9uZHMgYW5kIExha2Vz_8-hky}

Ponds and lakes may get their water from several sources. Some falls
directly into them as precipitation. Some enters as runoff and some from
streams and rivers. Water leaves ponds and lakes through evaporation and
also as outflow.

#### How Lakes Form {#7.html#x-ck12-SG93IExha2VzIEZvcm0._8-udf}

The depression that allows water to collect to form a lake may come
about in a variety of ways. The Great Lakes, for example, are glacial
lakes. A glacial lake forms when a glacier scrapes a large hole in the
ground. When the glacier melts, the water fills the hole and forms a
lake. A kettle lake forms in the sediment left by a glacier when a block
of ice melts. Kettle lakes are found where continental glaciers once
covered the land ( *Figure* '
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1EZW5hbGlNb29zZQ..) ). Over time lakes
get water from rain, streams, and groundwater coming to the surface.

</div>

Other lakes are crater lakes or rift lakes ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDgtQ3JhdGVyLWFuZC1SaWZ0LUxha2Vz) ).
Crater lakes form when volcanic eruptions create craters that fill with
water. Rift lakes form when movements of tectonic plates create low
places that fill with water.

#### The Great Lakes {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdyZWF0IExha2Vz_8-4ej}

Large lakes are similar to oceans. They have tides and currents. Large
lakes can affect weather patterns. The Great Lakes ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDctVGhlLUdyZWF0LUxha2Vz) ) contain
22% of the world’s fresh surface water. The largest of them, Lake
Superior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day.
The Great Lakes cause “lake effect” snow. In the winter, a large amount
of snow may fall downwind of the relatively warm lakes. The Great Lakes
are home to countless species of fish and wildlife.

#### Reservoirs {#7.html#x-ck12-UmVzZXJ2b2lycw.._8-8gx}

Many lakes are not natural, but are human-made. People dam a stream in a
suitable spot. Water backs up behind the dam, creating a lake. These
lakes are "reservoirs" ( **Figure**

**Is the water cycle perfect?**

The amount of water Earth has doesn't change. So if the water cycle were
perfect, there would always be the right amount of water in each
reservoir. In winter, there would be the right amount of snow. The snow
would melt in the right amounts and at the right times in the spring. A
good amount of rain would fall. Not so little that there would be a
drought and not so much that there would be a flood. But the water cycle
is not perfect. Floods are all too common.

### Floods {#7.html#x-ck12-Rmxvb2Rz_9-sa8}

A **flood** occurs when so much water enters a stream or river that it
overflows its banks. Flood waters from a river are pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JbmRpYW5hRmxvb2Q.) ).

Flooding in Indiana.

</div>

Floods are a natural part of the water cycle, but they can cause a lot
of damage. Farms and homes may be lost, and people may die. In 1939,
millions of people died in a flood in China. Although freshwater is
needed to grow crops and just to live, too much freshwater in the same
place at once can be deadly.

#### Causes of Floods {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIEZsb29kcw.._9-3tg}

Floods may occur when deep snow melts quickly in the spring. More often,
floods are due to heavy rainfall. Floods happen when rain falls more
quickly than water can be absorbed into the ground or carried away by
rivers or streams.

Extremely heavy rains across the Midwestern U.S. in April 2011 led to
flooding of the rivers in the Mississippi River basin in May 2011 (

Madrid
Floodway](ck12_7_files/20150911025802558872.png "Flooding in 2011 of the Mississippi River, and the opening of the New Madrid Floodway")

**Figure 7.27**

Record flow in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers has to go somewhere.
Normal spring river levels are shown in 2010. The flooded region in the
image from May 3, 2011 is the New Madrid Floodway, where overflow water
is meant to go. 2011 is the first time since 1927 that this floodway was
used.

</div>

#### Buffers to Flooding {#7.html#x-ck12-QnVmZmVycyB0byBGbG9vZGluZw.._9-si0}

Heavily vegetated lands are less likely to experience flooding. Plants
slow down water as it runs over the land, giving it time to enter the
ground. If the ground is too wet to absorb more water, plants still slow
the water’s passage. Slower water keeps all the water from entering the
stream at once. Wetlands play a key role in minimizing the impacts of
floods. Wetlands act as a buffer between land and high water levels.
Flooding is often more severe in areas that have been recently logged.

#### Flood Protection {#7.html#x-ck12-Rmxvb2QgUHJvdGVjdGlvbg.._9-dt4}

People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations,
they use sandbags ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JbmRpYW5hU2FuZGJhZ3M.) ). Dams are
usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to
break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also
overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with **levees** to protect
against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its
banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes
problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force
the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a
different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be
allowed to flood.

Within the floodplain of the Nile, soils are fertile enough for
productive agriculture. Beyond this, infertile desert soils prevent

Amazingly, floods can be good. Flood waters carry nutrients that are
deposited on the floodplain. So floodplains are good places for farming.
In the past, the Nile River ( **Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OaWxlRmxvb2RwbGFpblNvaWw.) ) in Egypt
flooded each year. The flood waters brought much-needed nutrients in to
farms. In the 1960s Egypt built the Aswan Dam to protects crop and
settlements from the floods. However, after the dam was built, farmers
began to need fertilizers to feed their crops.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-ptx}

-   Too much water in a drainage will result in a flood.
-   Floods are made worse when vegetation is cleared, when the land is
    already soaked, or when hillsides have been logged.
-   People build dams and levees to protect from flooding. In an
    emergency, sandbags can be put out.
-   Floods are a source of nutrients on a floodplain.

**Can solid ice really move?**

Yes! This is the Hubbard Glacier in Alaska. As the glacier meets the
relatively warm seawater, it calves. Pieces of the glacier break off and
fall into the water. These icebergs may be as large as a ten-story
building.

### Where are the Glaciers? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgYXJlIHRoZSBHbGFjaWVycz8._10-oa0}

Nearly all glacial ice is in the polar regions. The largest ice sheets
are in Antarctica and Greenland. The remaining 1% of Earth's ice is
found elsewhere, like in the mountains, for example. At higher
altitudes, temperatures are colder. Snow is more likely to fall and not
melt. Except Australia, every continent has glaciers in the high
mountains.

### Types of Glaciers {#7.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgR2xhY2llcnM._10-vkt}

The types of glaciers are:

-   **Continental glaciers** are large ice sheets that cover relatively
    flat ground. These glaciers flow outward from where the greatest
    amounts of snow and ice accumulate.
-   **Alpine (valley) glaciers** flow downhill. Ice accumulates near the
    top of a mountain and then travels down existing valleys (
    **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy0wOC0wNy0wMC1Td2lzcy1HbGFjaWVy) ).

-   **Ice caps** are large glaciers that cover a larger area than just
    a valley. An ice cap can bury an entire mountain range or region (
    **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbnRhcmN0aWNhR2xvYmVWaWV3) ).
    Glaciers come off of ice caps into valleys.

### Glacial Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-R2xhY2lhbCBHcm93dGg._10-awd}

Glaciers are not static; they grow, they move and they shrink.
Currently, most glaciers are shrinking.

#### Formation {#7.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9u_10-fy9}

Glaciers grow when snowfall exceeds melting. Snow falls higher on the
glacier. Over time, the snow converts to granular ice known as firn. As
more snow and ice collect, the firn becomes denser. This is now glacial
ice.

Glaciers form only on land because water is too warm. When a glacier
flows into water, it usually breaks up into icebergs. Those icebergs
eventually melt into the water.

#### Movement {#7.html#x-ck12-TW92ZW1lbnQ._10-6z4}

How does an ice field become a glacier? In other words, why does the ice
move? Whether an ice field moves depends on the amount of ice. It also
depends on the steepness of the slope and the roughness of the ground
surface. Ice moves where the pressure is so great that the ice needs to
move away. Ice also slides at the bottom. Often the ground is lubricated
by water that melted from the glacier above. Under some conditions, a
glacier will move extremely fast. Under other conditions, the glacier
may not move and will become an ice sheet.

Because the ice is moving, glaciers have cracks called **crevasses** (
**Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ccmlrc2RhbHNicmVlbkdsYWNpZXI.) ).
There is a large crevasse at the top of an alpine glacier called a
**bergshrund** . Below the bergshrund, the ice is moving downhill. Above
the bergshrund, the ice is stuck to the mountain.

#### Shrinking {#7.html#x-ck12-U2hyaW5raW5n_10-xsa}

Glaciers are melting back in many locations around the world. When a
glacier no longer moves, it is called an ice sheet. This usually happens
when it is less than 0.1 km2 in area and 50 m thick.

In Glacier National Park ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1HcmlubmVsbEdsYWNpZXI.) ), many glaciers
have become ice sheets. In 1850, the park had 150 glaciers. There are
only about 25 today. The reason that there is so much melting is that
summer temperatures have risen. Scientists estimate that the park will
have no active glaciers as early as 2020.

This satellite image shows Grinnell Glacier, Swiftcurrent Glacier, and

1950. Gem Glacier is only 0.020 km ^2^ (5 acres) in area. This makes it
about one-fifth the size of the smallest active glaciers. Is Gem really
a glacier?

</div>

### Glaciers as a Resource {#7.html#x-ck12-R2xhY2llcnMgYXMgYSBSZXNvdXJjZQ.._10-e4r}

Melting glaciers in mountain regions provide an important source of
water in the summer. Organisms and nearby human populations may depend
on glacial melt water during long dry summers. People near the Andes in
South America are just some of the groups that rely on glacial meltwater
in the summer.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-mhl}

-   Glaciers are ice that moves.
-   Continental glaciers form in a central location with ice moving
    outward in all directions. Alpine glaciers form in high mountains
    and travel through valleys. Ice caps cover large areas.
-   Because glaciers move, they have characteristic features like
    crevasses and bergshrunds.

**What are these faucets tapping into?**

This certainly is an odd sight! We expect to see water at Earth's
surface, but coming out of solid rock? Amazingly, much of Earth's fresh
water is hidden from sight. It is present in rock and soil. In fact, 20
times more of Earth’s liquid freshwater is found below the surface than
on the surface.

### Groundwater {#7.html#x-ck12-R3JvdW5kd2F0ZXI._11-lpx}

Freshwater below Earth’s surface is called **groundwater** . The water
infiltrates, or seeps down into, the ground from the surface. How does
this happen? And where does the water go?

#### Porous and Impermeable Rock {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9yb3VzIGFuZCBJbXBlcm1lYWJsZSBSb2Nr_11-zpj}

Water infiltrates the ground because soil and rock may have air spaces
between the grains. These pores, or tiny holes, result in the rock's
**porosity** . If water can move through a rock, the rock is
**permeable** . Eventually, the water reaches a layer of rock that is
not porous. This rock is **impermeable** . Water stops moving downward
when it reaches an impermeable layer.

This animation shows porosity and permeability:
[http://www.nature.nps.gov/GEOLOGY/usgsnps/animate/POROS\_3.MPG](POROS_3.MPG)
. The water droplets are found in the pores between the sediment grains.
This is porosity. When the water can travel between pores, that’s
permeability.

The diagram below ( **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XZWxs)
) shows two layers of porous rock. The top layer is not saturated; it is
not full of water. The next layer is saturated. The water in this layer
has nowhere else to go. It cannot seep any deeper into the ground
because the rock below it is impermeable.

#### The Water Table {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFdhdGVyIFRhYmxl_11-gnx}

The top of the saturated rock layer above ( **Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XZWxs) ) is called the **water table**
. The water table isn’t like a real table. It doesn’t remain firmly in
one place. Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps
down from the surface. The water table is higher when there is a lot of
rain, and it is lower when the weather is dry.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-iuq}

-   Water infiltrates into the ground.
-   There is much more fresh water underground than on the surface.
-   A rock layer must be porous and permeable to be a good aquifer. An
    impermeable layer makes up the bottom of an aquifer.
-   The water table rises and falls with additions or subtractions to
    the groundwater system.

In some parts of the world, gathering water for the family is a process
that takes several hours. This is usually considered to be women's work.
What are you doing during the hours that girls your age might be helping

### Aquifer {#7.html#x-ck12-QXF1aWZlcg.._12-nfh}

An underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is
called an **aquifer** . A diagram of an aquifer is pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMTItQXF1aWZlcg..) ).
Aquifers are generally found in porous rock, such as sandstone. Water
infiltrates the aquifer from the surface. The water that enters the
aquifer is called **recharge** .

**Figure 7.35**

An aquifer is a layer of saturated porous rock. It lies below the water
table. An impermeable layer, such as clay, is below the aquifer.

</div>

#### Human Use of Aquifers {#7.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gVXNlIG9mIEFxdWlmZXJz_12-9eb}

Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by
people for fresh water. The closer to the surface an aquifer is, the
easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface
is also more likely to become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through
porous rock in recharge water.

An aquifer that is used by people may not be recharged as quickly as its
water is removed. The water table may lower and the aquifer may even run
dry. If this happens, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This is
likely to damage any homes or other structures built above the aquifer.

#### Wells {#7.html#x-ck12-V2VsbHM._12-j7p}

Most groundwater does not flow out of an aquifer as a spring or geyser.
So to use the water that's stored in an aquifer, people must go after
it. How? They dig a well. A **well** ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMTgtV2F0ZXItV2VsbA..) ) is a hole
that is dug or drilled through the ground down to an aquifer.

A well runs from the surface to a point below the water table. Why must
a well go lower than the water table?

</div>

People have depended on water from wells for thousands of years. To
bring water to the surface takes energy because the force of gravity
must be overcome. Today, many wells use electricity to pump water to the
surface. However, in some places, water is still brought to the surface
the old-fashioned way—with human labor. The well pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XYXRlcldlbGw.) ) is an
example of this type of well. A hand-cranked pulley is used to lift the
bucket of water to the surface.

**A sacred spring**

At Tampak Siring in Bali, Indonesia, spring water emerges into a temple.
The water is thought to have healing powers. Many Hindu people come to
the temple to emerge in the water and pray. They hope the water will
cure their diseases.

### Springs {#7.html#x-ck12-U3ByaW5ncw.._13-vnh}

The top of an aquifer may be high enough in some places to meet the
surface of the ground. This often happens on a slope. The water flows
out of the ground and creates a **spring** . A spring may be just a tiny
trickle, or it may be a big gush of water.

Water flowing out of the ground at a spring may flow downhill and enter
a stream. If the water from a spring can’t flow downhill, it may spread
out to form a pond or lake instead. In the desert, the only reliable
water may be from springs ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OZXZhZGFOYXR1cmFsU3ByaW5n) ). A spring
may allow wildlife to inhabit an uninhabitable area.

#### Artesian Spring {#7.html#x-ck12-QXJ0ZXNpYW4gU3ByaW5n_13-bzi}

Sometimes an aquifer is confined. A confined aquifer is trapped between
two impermeable rock layers. Pressure from the rock layer on top forces
the water out where the aquifer reaches the ground surface. Water that
flows up to the surface naturally is an **artesian spring** . If people
drill a well into a confined aquifer, the water may flow to the surface
without assistance. This is an artesian well ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HZXJtYW5XZWxs) ).

#### Mineral Springs and Hot Springs {#7.html#x-ck12-TWluZXJhbCBTcHJpbmdzIGFuZCBIb3QgU3ByaW5ncw.._13-bsi}

Some springs have water that contains minerals. Groundwater dissolves
minerals out of the rock as it seeps through the pores. The water in
some springs is hot because it is heated by hot magma. Many hot springs
are also mineral springs. That’s because hot water can dissolve more
minerals than cold water.

Springs in Yellowstone National Park are hot and contain dissolved
minerals. Morning Glory Pool ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1ZZWxsb3dzdG9uZU1vcm5pbmdHbG9yeVBvb2w.)
) has a bright green color from dissolved minerals. Along the edge are
thick orange mats of bacteria. The bacteria use the minerals in the hot
water to make food.

### Geysers {#7.html#x-ck12-R2V5c2Vycw.._13-uzk}

Heated groundwater may become trapped in spaces within rocks. Pressure
builds up as more water seeps into the spaces. When the pressure becomes
great enough, the water bursts out of the ground at a crack or weak
spot. This is called a **geyser** . When the water erupts from the
ground, the pressure is released. Then more water collects and the
pressure builds up again. This leads to another eruption.

Old Faithful ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PbGRGYWl0aGZ1bA..) ) is the best-known
geyser in the world. The geyser erupts faithfully every 90 minutes, day
after day. During each eruption, it may release as much as 30,000 liters
of water!

**What makes the desert bloom? Water!**

You hear a lot about making the desert bloom. Many plants do well in the
desert if they are given water. Since deserts do not have much water,
groundwater is used. In many desert locations, groundwater is being
pumped much faster than it is being recharged. What will happen in the
future?

### Human Use of Aquifers {#7.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gVXNlIG9mIEFxdWlmZXJz_14-lin}

Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by
people for freshwater. The closer to the surface an aquifer is, the
easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface
is also more likely to become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through
porous rock in recharge water.

People may use the water in an aquifer faster than it is recharged. When
this happens, the water table will lower. Wells may go dry. To get to
the water, the well will need to be dug deeper.

As the water table lowers, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This
is called **subsidence** . When the ground subsides, any homes or other
structures built above the aquifer will be damaged. The San Joaquin
Valley of California is one of the world’s major agricultural areas. So
much groundwater has been pumped that the land has subsided many tens of
feet.

#### The Ogallala Aquifer {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE9nYWxsYWxhIEFxdWlmZXI._14-0qb}

One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer. As you
can see below ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMTMtT2dhbGxhbGEtQXF1aWZlcg..) ), this
aquifer lies beneath parts of eight U.S. states. In some places, it is
less than a meter deep. In other places, it is hundreds of meters deep.
The water in the aquifer is mostly from the last ice age.

</div>

The Ogallala aquifer is an important source of freshwater in the
American Midwest. This is a major farming area, and much of the water is
used to irrigate crops. The water in this aquifer is being used up ten
times faster than it is recharged. If this continues, what might happen
to the Ogallala aquifer?

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-qle}

-   When water is pumped from an aquifer, the water table goes down.
    Wells must be drilled deeper to get water.
-   The Ogallala Aquifer was filled in the ice age. It is heavily used
    to irrigate Midwestern farms. The use rate is several times faster
    than the recharge rate.
-   Ground subsidence is a consequences of groundwater overuse.

**Do you live near water? Do you see pollution?**

Water pollution is a worldwide problem. Almost anything released into
the air or onto the land can end up in Earth’s water.

### Surface Water Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBXYXRlciBQb2xsdXRpb24._15-fwn}

Water pollution may come from one source. For example, chemicals from a
factory may empty into a stream. Water pollution may come from more than
one source, too. For example, chemicals may rain from the air into that
same stream. It is much more difficult to control pollution from more
than one source.

In the developed nations there are three main sources of water
pollution:

1.  Agriculture.
2.  Industry.
3.  Municipal, or community.

#### Agriculture {#7.html#x-ck12-QWdyaWN1bHR1cmU._15-ei3}

Chemicals that are applied to farm fields include fertilizers and
pesticides. Excess chemicals can be picked up by rainwater. The
chemicals can end up in streams, ponds, lakes, or the ocean. Dissolved
fertilizer causes tremendous numbers of water plants and algae to grow.
This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes or the
coastal oceans.

Waste from livestock can also pollute water. The waste contains
**pathogens** that can cause diseases. Many farms in the U.S. have
thousands of animals. These farms produce millions of gallons of waste.
The waste is stored in huge lagoons, like the one pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMTEtbWFudXJlLWxhZ29vbg..)
). Many leaks from these lagoons have occurred.

the picture for scale.

</div>

#### Industry {#7.html#x-ck12-SW5kdXN0cnk._15-p3j}

Factories and power plants may pollute water with harmful substances.

-   Many industries produce toxic chemicals.
-   Nuclear power plants produce **radioactive** wastes.
-   Oil tanks and pipelines can leak.

</div>

#### Municipal {#7.html#x-ck12-TXVuaWNpcGFs_15-cx9}

“Municipal” refers to the community. Households and businesses in a
community can pollute the water supply. Municipal pollution comes from
sewage, storm drains, septic tanks, boats, and runoff from yards. For
example:

-   People apply chemicals to their lawns. The excess can run off into
    surface waters.
-   People may dispose of harmful substances incorrectly. For example,
    motor oil must not be drained into a storm sewer.
-   Municipal sewage treatment plants dump treated wastewater into
    rivers or lakes. But the wastewater may not be treated for
    everything, or it may not be treated enough.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-brk}

-   Pollution enters water from municipal, industrial,
    agricultural sources.
-   Fertilizer runoff can create dead zones in the ocean.
-   People pollute water when they apply excess chemicals to their lawn.
    They may also dispose of pollutants incorrectly.

**How could a river burn?**

In the mid 1900s, rivers sometimes caught fire. The Cuyahoga River did
several times. The river was so full of oil and industrial waste that it
was flammable. Nothing could live in it. A fire on the Cuyahoga River in
1969 gained national attention. Something had to be done to protect the
water supply.

### Protecting the Water Supply {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVjdGluZyB0aGUgV2F0ZXIgU3VwcGx5_16-k6m}

The water supply can be harmed in two major ways. The water can be
polluted, and it can be overused. Protecting the water supply must
address both problems. We need to reduce how much pollution ends up in
the water supply—keeping water from being polluted is easier and cheaper
than cleaning it. We need to treat water that’s already polluted. We
need to conserve water by using less.

### Controlling Water Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbGxpbmcgV2F0ZXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_16-i8f}

Disasters, such as rivers burning, led to new U.S. laws to protect the
water. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was
established, and the Clean Water Act was passed. Now, water is routinely
tested. Pollution is tracked to its source, and polluters are forced to
fix the problem and clean up the pollution. They are also fined. These
consequences have led industries, agriculture, and communities to
pollute the water much less than before.

#### The Clean Water Act {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENsZWFuIFdhdGVyIEFjdA.._16-5az}

Keeping water clean often requires laws. Laws ensure that people behave
responsibly. The Clean Water Act regulates water pollution in the U.S.
The law allows the EPA to set standards for water quality. The EPA
regulates the pollutants that can enter waterways. The agency can
provide money for wastewater treatment plants. The law was passed in
1972.

International groups are trying to improve global water quality. The
United Nations and other groups provide the technology for treating
water. They educate people in how to protect and improve their water (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XYXRlclNhbXBsaW5n) ).

### Water Treatment {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgVHJlYXRtZW50_16-iwr}

Water treatment is a series of processes that remove unwanted substances
from water. The goal of water treatment is to make the water safe to
return to the natural environment or to the human water supply. Treating
water for other purposes may not include all the same steps. That’s
because water used in agriculture or industry may not have to be as
clean as drinking water.

Below, you can see how water for drinking is treated ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjEtMTctd2F0ZXItdHJlYXRtZW50LXBsYW50) ).
Treating drinking water requires at least four processes:

1.  Chemicals are added to untreated water. They cause solids in the
    water to clump together. This is called **coagulation** .
2.  The water is moved to tanks. The clumped solids sink to the bottom
    of the water. This is called **sedimentation** .
3.  The water is passed through filters that remove smaller particles
    from the water. This is called **filtration** .
4.  Chlorine is added to the water to kill bacteria and other microbes.
    This is called **disinfection** . Finally, the water is pure enough
    to drink.

### What Can You Do? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBDYW4gWW91IERvPw.._16-cfl}

What can individuals do to protect water quality?

-   Dispose of motor oil and household chemicals properly. Phone your
    community for instructions.
-   Use lawn, garden, and farm chemicals sparingly. Use them wisely.
    Excess chemicals will run off into the water supply.
-   Repair automobile or boat engine leaks immediately.
-   Keep litter, pet waste, leaves, and grass clippings out of street
    gutters and storm drains.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-ovk}

-   There are multiple levels of water treatment. Some water is cleaned
    enough for use on lawns. Some must be made safe for drinking.
-   Individuals can protect water by following some guidelines.
-   The Clean Water Act regulates pollutants and provides money for
    wastewater treatment plants to be built.
-   Keeping water from becoming polluted is easier, less expensive, and
    safer than cleaning it once it is polluted.

**Would you drink this water?**

Cleaning water is not easy. Cleaning groundwater is especially
difficult. If you want to drink clean water, groundwater must not become
polluted. Or it must be cleaned.

### Groundwater Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-R3JvdW5kd2F0ZXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_17-jxn}

Pollutants in surface water can filter into the ground and enter a
groundwater aquifer. Irrigation water can bring pesticides and other
chemicals. Water can seep through landfills. Tanks of gasoline stored
underground can leak.

Pollutants can be filtered out of water that travels through rock and
soil. Filtering is very effective, but it doesn't get out all of the
pollutants.

Pollutants that enter an aquifer spread outward from the source. They
spread in the direction the water is moving.

### Cleaning Groundwater {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xlYW5pbmcgR3JvdW5kd2F0ZXI._17-but}

It is a lot easier and cheaper not to pollute surface water than it is
to clean it. That is even truer for groundwater. To clean groundwater,
the water must be cleaned. Also, the rock and soil it travels through
must be cleaned. Then the toxic rock and soil must be put somewhere.
Cleaning polluted groundwater is expensive and can take years. Sometimes
it can't even be done.

### Stages of Groundwater Cleaning {#7.html#x-ck12-U3RhZ2VzIG9mIEdyb3VuZHdhdGVyIENsZWFuaW5n_17-9fd}

To clean groundwater you must:

-   Eliminate the pollution source: An underground tank must be pumped
    dry and then dug out from the ground. A factory must be required to
    stop releasing toxic chemicals. Farms must be more careful about the
    chemicals they put on their fields.
-   Monitor the extent of the pollutant: Scientists test water in wells.
    Sometimes they drill wells to test water. They learn how the
    groundwater is flowing: how fast and in what direction. They study
    the contaminants in the groundwater. Then they determine where the
    contaminant plume is going.

**Figure 7.48**

Test wells are drilled to monitor groundwater pollution.

</div>

-   Engage in remediation: A barrier is constructed in the aquifer. This
    isolates the contaminated groundwater from the rest of the aquifer.
    The contaminated groundwater must be treated. **Remediation** is
    correcting a problem.
    -   The cheapest and easiest way is to treat the water in
        the aquifer.
        -   **Bioremediation** is one way of treating the water in
            the aquifer. Microorganisms are bioengineered to eat
            the pollutant. The organisms are injected into the
            contaminated region. They consume the pollutant.
            Bioremediation is short for biological remediation.
        -   **Chemical remediation** can also treat water in
            the aquifer. A chemical is pumped into the aquifer. The
            chemical destroys the contaminant.
    -   It is much more difficult and expensive to remove the water from
        the aquifer and then treat it. The water is pumped to
        the surface. It is then cleansed using chemical or
        biological methods. It is re-injected into the aquifer. The
        contaminated rock and soil must be dug up and the
        pollutant destroyed. Then it is returned to the ground. This is
        done only in extreme cases.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-jic}

-   To clean groundwater: remove the pollutant source, monitor the
    pollutant, and perform remediation.
-   Scientists test the water in many wells to see where the
    contaminant is. They do this to tell where the contaminant is. Over
    time they can tell which direction the contaminant is moving.
-   Cleaning groundwater in an aquifer requires bioremediation or
    chemical remediation. Bioremediation uses microorganisms to consume
    a pollutant. Chemical remediation destroys the contaminant.

**What does this whale know about the oceans?**

People divide up the seas into five oceans. But they are really all
interconnected. Even so, they are all very different. This ocean is near
a shore and is obviously in a cold region. It appears to be a good
habitat for whales! No matter what, the oceans have a huge influence on
the planet, locally and as a whole.

### The Oceans’ Influence {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE9jZWFuc-KAmSBJbmZsdWVuY2U._18-8lp}

Oceans cover more than 70% of Earth's surface. Oceans hold 97% of the
planet's surface water. It’s no surprise that the oceans have a big
influence on the planet. The oceans affect the atmosphere, climate, and
living things.

#### Oceans and the Atmosphere {#7.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5zIGFuZCB0aGUgQXRtb3NwaGVyZQ.._18-s6n}

Oceans are the major source of water vapor in the atmosphere. Sunlight
heats water near the sea surface ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMDMtT2NlYW5zLWFuZC1BdG1vc3BoZXJlLUdhcy1FeGNoYW5nZQ..)
). As the water warms, some of it evaporates. The water vapor rises into
the air, where it may form clouds and precipitation. Precipitation
provides the freshwater needed by plants and other living things.

![Gas exchange between the oceans and the
atmosphere](ck12_7_files/20150911025804540116.jpeg "Gas exchange between the oceans and the atmosphere")

**Figure 7.49**

The oceans and atmosphere exchange gases. Why does water vapor enter the
atmosphere from the water?

</div>

Ocean water also absorbs gases from the atmosphere. The most important
are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is needed by living things in the
oceans. Much of the carbon dioxide sinks to the bottom of the seas.
Carbon dioxide is a major cause of global warming. By absorbing carbon
dioxide, the oceans help control global warming. At least as long as the
carbon dioxide stays in the seas.

#### Oceans and Climate {#7.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5zIGFuZCBDbGltYXRl_18-kl7}

Coastal areas have a milder climate than inland areas. They are warmer
in the winter and cooler in the summer. That’s because land near an
ocean is influenced by the temperature of the oceans. The temperature of
ocean water is moderate and stable. Why? There are two major reasons:

1.  Water is much slower to warm up and cool down than land. As a
    result, oceans never get as hot or as cold as land.
2.  Water flows through all the world’s oceans. Warm water from the
    Equator mixes with cold water from the poles. The mixing of warm and
    cold water makes the water temperature moderate.

Even inland temperatures are milder because of oceans. Without oceans,
there would be much bigger temperature swings all over Earth.
Temperatures might plunge hundreds of degrees below freezing in the
winter. In the summer, lakes and seas might boil! Life as we know it
could not exist on Earth without the oceans.

#### Oceans and Living Things {#7.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5zIGFuZCBMaXZpbmcgVGhpbmdz_18-zw5}

The oceans provide a home to many living things. In fact, a greater
number of organisms lives in the oceans than on land. Coral reefs (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db3JhbFJlZWY.) ) have more
diversity of life forms than almost anywhere else on Earth. Biological
diversity is shortened to **biodiversity** . Oceans contain the majority
of **biomass** on Earth.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-nwl}

-   Oceans are an important part of the water cycle. They absorb gases
    from the atmosphere. They evaporate and supply water vapor to
    the atmosphere.
-   Oceans moderate Earth's temperature by not changing
    temperature rapidly. Oceans also distribute heat around the planet.
-   Oceans have tremendous biodiversity. They also contain the majority
    of all biomass on Earth.

**What do you get when you evaporate seawater?**

Salt! Human bodies need salt to live. Nowadays most of this salt comes
from the oceans or saline lakes. Some salt comes from rocks that
evaporated from seawater.

### Makeup of Ocean Water {#7.html#x-ck12-TWFrZXVwIG9mIE9jZWFuIFdhdGVy_19-9mr}

You know that ocean water is salty. How salty is it? What is the
**salinity** of seawater? Average seawater is about 3.5% salt. The
amount is different if there is a nearby source of freshwater. It is
also different if there is a lot of evaporation in an area. How do you
think these things affect seawater salinity? Seawater also contains
other substances like sugars, acids, bases, and organic molecules.

#### Why Is Ocean Water Salty? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2h5IElzIE9jZWFuIFdhdGVyIFNhbHR5Pw.._19-yqs}

Ocean water is salty because water dissolves minerals out of rocks. The
ions enter the water. This happens whenever water flows over or through
rocks. Much of this water and its minerals end up in the oceans.
Minerals dissolved in water form salts. When the water evaporates, it
leaves the salts behind. As a result, ocean water is much saltier than
other water on Earth.

#### How Salty Is Ocean Water? {#7.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNhbHR5IElzIE9jZWFuIFdhdGVyPw.._19-esz}

Have you ever gone swimming in the ocean? If you have, then you probably
tasted the salts in the water. By mass, salts make up about 3.5% of
ocean water. The table below shows the most common minerals in ocean
water ( **Table** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-U2Vhd2F0ZXJfQ29tcG9zaXRpb24.)
). The main components are sodium and chloride. Together they form the
salt known as sodium chloride. You may know the compound as table salt
or the mineral halite.

  **Element**   **Percent**
  ------------- -------------
  Oxygen        85.84
  Hydrogen      10.82
  Chloride      1.94
  Sodium        1.08
  Magnesium     0.1292
  Sulfur        0.091
  Calcium       0.04
  Potassium     0.04
  Bromine       0.0067
  Carbon        0.0028

The amount of salts in ocean water varies from place to place. For
example, near the mouth of a river, ocean water may be less salty.
That’s because river water contains less salt than ocean water. Where
the ocean is warm, the water may be more salty. Can you explain why?
(Hint: More water evaporates when the water is warm.)

### Density {#7.html#x-ck12-RGVuc2l0eQ.._19-fly}

Seawater has lots of salts in it. This increases its **density** (mass
per volume) over fresh water. Temperature and pressure also affect
density.

Water density increases as:

-   salinity increases.
-   temperature decreases.
-   pressure increases.

Differences in water density are responsible for deep ocean currents, as
will be discussed in the concept "Deep Ocean Currents."

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-24v}

-   Water moving through rock and soil picks up ions. Those ions end up
    as salts in large bodies of water.
-   Ocean water contains salts and other substances.
-   Water density increases as salinity and pressure increase, or as
    temperature decreases.

**If you go down in the ocean what do you see?**

Imagine you're in a submersible going to the bottom of the ocean. The
first thing you realize is that it's not light for very long. The next
thing is that many of the creatures that live just below where it's
light create their own light. This is called **bioluminescence** . What
is the advantage of being able to light up if you live in the dark?

### Ocean Zones {#7.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4gWm9uZXM._20-rex}

In addition to the amount of salts, other conditions in ocean water vary
from place to place. One is the amount of nutrients in the water.
Another is the amount of sunlight that reaches the water. These
conditions depend mainly on two factors: distance from shore and depth
of water. Oceans are divided into zones ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMDYtT2NlYW4tWm9uZXMtbmV3) ) based on
these two factors. The ocean floor makes up another zone.

**Figure 7.51**

Distance from shore and depth of water define ocean zones. Which zone is
on the ocean floor?

</div>

#### Zones Based on Distance from Shore {#7.html#x-ck12-Wm9uZXMgQmFzZWQgb24gRGlzdGFuY2UgZnJvbSBTaG9yZQ.._20-jew}

There are three main ocean zones based on distance from shore. They are
the **intertidal zone** , **neritic zone** , and **oceanic zone** .
Distance from shore influences how many nutrients are in the water. Why?
Most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land. Therefore, water
closer to shore tends to have more nutrients. Living things need
nutrients. So distance from shore also influences how many organisms
live in the water.

#### Zones Based on Depth of Water {#7.html#x-ck12-Wm9uZXMgQmFzZWQgb24gRGVwdGggb2YgV2F0ZXI._20-50g}

Scientists refer to the vertical extent of ocean water as the **water
column** . Two main zones based on depth of water are the photic zone
and aphotic zone. The **photic zone** is the top 200 meters of water.
The **aphotic zone** is water deeper than 200 meters. The deeper you go,
the darker the water gets. That’s because sunlight cannot penetrate very
far under water. Sunlight is needed for photosynthesis. So the depth of
water determines whether photosynthesis is possible. There is enough
sunlight for photosynthesis only in the photic zone.

Water also gets colder as you go deeper. The weight of the water
pressing down from above increases as well. At great depths, life
becomes very difficult. The pressure is so great that only specially
adapted creatures can live there.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-ypi}

-   The small surface zone that has light is the photic zone. The entire
    rest of the ocean does not have light and is the aphotic zone.
-   The ocean is divided into horizontal zones based on the depth of
    water beneath: the intertidal, neritic, and oceanic.
-   Most of the life forms in the oceans live in, or at least visit,
    the surface.

**Surfin' U.S.A.**

Jaws Beach in Maui, Hawaii has legendary waves. The largest waves come
when winds are very strong, usually in the winter. The rocks and reef
offshore magnify the size of the incoming wave energy. Cowabunga!

### Waves {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZXM._21-zwh}

Most ocean waves are caused by winds. A **wave** is the transfer of
energy through matter. A wave that travels across miles of ocean is
traveling energy, not water. Ocean waves transfer energy from wind to
the water. The energy is transferred from one water molecule to the
next. The energy of a wave may travel for thousands of miles. The water
itself moves very little. The picture below shows how water molecules
move when a wave goes by ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMDktQW5hdG9teS1vZi1hLVdhdmUtbmV3) ).
Once the wave starts, it doesn't need more wind to keep it going.

#### The Size of Waves {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNpemUgb2YgV2F2ZXM._21-93t}

The figure above also shows how the size of waves is measured (
**Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMDktQW5hdG9teS1vZi1hLVdhdmUtbmV3) ).
The highest point of a wave is the **crest** . The lowest point is the
**trough** . The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the
**wave height** . Wave height is also called **amplitude** . The
horizontal distance between two crests is the **wavelength** . Both
amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size.

The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a
distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors
is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with
hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds
may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long
distances and may last for many days.

#### Breaking Waves {#7.html#x-ck12-QnJlYWtpbmcgV2F2ZXM._21-ugv}

The figure below shows what happens to waves near shore ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMTAtQnJlYWtpbmctV2F2ZXM.) ). As waves
move into shallow water, they start to touch the bottom. The base of the
waves drag and slow. Soon the waves slow down and pile up. They get
steeper and unstable as the top moves faster than the base. When they
reach the shore, the waves topple over and break.

### Storm Surge {#7.html#x-ck12-U3Rvcm0gU3VyZ2U._21-rse}

Some of the damage done by storms is from **storm surge** . Low pressure
in a storm pulls water upward. Water piles up at a shoreline as storm
winds push waves into the coast. Storm surge may raise sea level as much
as 7.5 m (25 ft). This can be devastating in a shallow land area when
winds, waves, and rain are intense.

A wild video of “Storm Surge” can be seen on National Geographic Videos,
Environment Video, Natural Disasters, Landslides, and more:
[http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/player/environment/]() .

Maverick waves are massive. Learning how they are generated can tell
scientists a great deal about how the ocean creates waves and especially
large waves.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-3hb}

-   The largest wind waves are built when a strong wind blows for a long
    time over a large area.
-   It is not the water that travels in a wave; it is the energy that is
    transferred from where the wave formed.
-   A wave breaks when it is too tall to be supported by its base. This
    is common as a wave moves up the shore.

**Did you ever build a sandcastle?**

A sandcastle only lasts until the next tide comes in. To build a sand
castle the sand must be moist enough for the grains to stick together.
So it has to be near the water. But that puts the castle in position to
be buried by the next high tide. Oh well. You can build another one when
the tide goes back out!

### Tides {#7.html#x-ck12-VGlkZXM._22-uzw}

**Tides** are daily changes in the level of ocean water. They occur all
around the globe. **High tides** occur when the water reaches its
highest level in a day. **Low tides** occur when the water reaches its
lowest level in a day. Tides keep cycling from high to low and back
again. In most places the water level rises and falls twice a day. So
there are two high tides and two low tides approximately every 24 hours.

Below, you can see the difference between high and low tides (
**Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1CYXlPZkZ1bmR5VGlkZUNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) ).
This is called the **tidal range** .

#### Why Tides Occur {#7.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFRpZGVzIE9jY3Vy_22-geh}

The figure below shows why tides occur ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMTMtTW9vbi1jYXVzZXMtdGlkZXM.) ). The
main cause of tides is the pull of the Moon’s gravity on Earth. The pull
is greatest on whatever is closest to the Moon. Although the gravity
pulls the land, only the water can move. As a result:

-   Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon is pulled hardest by the
    Moon’s gravity. This causes a bulge of water on that side of Earth.
    That bulge is a high tide.
-   Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moon’s gravity than is the
    ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon. As a result, there is
    bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth. This creates another
    high tide.
-   With water bulging on two sides of Earth, there’s less water left
    in between. This creates low tides on the other two sides of
    the planet.

**Figure 7.55**

High and low tides are due mainly to the pull of the Moon’s gravity.

</div>

#### Spring Tides and Neap Tides {#7.html#x-ck12-U3ByaW5nIFRpZGVzIGFuZCBOZWFwIFRpZGVz_22-fmx}

The Sun’s gravity also pulls on Earth and its oceans. The Sun is much
larger than the Moon, so is its pull greater than the Moon’s? The pull
of the Sun’s gravity is much less because the Sun is much farther away.
The Sun’s gravity strengthens or weakens the Moon’s influence on tides.

The figure below shows where the Moon is relative to the Sun at
different times during the month ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMTQtU3VuLU1vb24tVGlkZXM.) ). The
positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other affects the tides.
This creates spring tides or neap tides.

-   **Spring tides** occur during the new moon and full moon. The Sun
    and Moon must either be in a straight line on the same side of
    Earth, or they must be on opposite sides of Earth. Their
    gravitational pull combines to cause very high and very low tides.
    Spring tides have the greatest tidal range.
-   **Neap tides** occur during the first and third quarters of
    the Moon. The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other. Their
    gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and
    lows are not as great. Neap tides have the smallest tidal range.

    the Moon. This causes two high and two low tides a day.
-   When the Sun's and Moon's tides match, there are spring tides. When
    the two tides are opposed, there are neap tides.

**What can debris tell us about surface currents?**

The surface of the ocean is on the move. One way to see this is when
something is dumped in the ocean. Where will it end up? The tsunami that
struck Japan in March 2011 pulled a lot of material into the ocean. The
image above is a model created in April 2012. The orange and red are
where floating debris might be. Scientists are creating models of where
the debris will go. But no one knows for sure where it will go or when
it will get there.

### Surface Currents {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBDdXJyZW50cw.._23-nuf}

Like air in the atmosphere, ocean water moves in currents. A current is
a stream of moving water that flows through the ocean. **Surface
currents** are caused mainly by winds but not daily winds. Surface
currents are caused by the major wind belts. These winds blow in the
same direction all the time. So they can keep water moving in the same
direction.

Surface currents are created by three things:

-   global wind patterns
-   the rotation of the Earth
-   the shape of the ocean basins

Surface currents are extremely important because they distribute heat
around the planet. Surface currents also have a tremendous influence on
climate around the globe.

#### Global Wind Patterns {#7.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFdpbmQgUGF0dGVybnM._23-u3o}

Winds on Earth are either global or local. Global winds blow in the same
directions all the time. They are created when more solar energy strikes
the Equator than the polar regions. More about global wind patterns is
described in detail in the concept "Global Wind Belts."

The major wind belts push the water in the surface currents. The water
moves in the direction of :

-   trade winds: east to west between the Equator and 30°N and 30°S.
-   westerlies: west to east in the middle latitudes.
-   polar easterlies: east to west between 50° and 60° north and south
    of the Equator and the North and South Poles.

#### Earth's Rotation {#7.html#x-ck12-RWFydGgncyBSb3RhdGlvbg.._23-zez}

The rotation of the Earth—that is, the **Coriolis effect** —causes the
ocean currents to turn. More information about the phenomenon can be
found in the concept "Coriolis Effect."

#### Shape of the Ocean Basins {#7.html#x-ck12-U2hhcGUgb2YgdGhlIE9jZWFuIEJhc2lucw.._23-qea}

A surface current move across the ocean. Eventually, the current runs
into land ( **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-RVMtb2NlYW4tY3VycmVudHM.)
). When it does, it turns right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in
the Southern Hemisphere. The direction is due to Coriolis effect.

The major surface currents are pictured below ( **Figure**

flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere. In the
Southern Hemisphere, they flow in the opposite direction. These loops
are called **gyres** . Only the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows
nonstop around the globe.

Currents are also found along shorelines ( **Figure**

are not related to the global wind belts. Two are **longshore currents**

determine what to do if you are caught in a rip current:

are caught in rip currents.

**How do ocean currents create giant redwoods?**

The California Current brings cool water south along the western United
States. Cool water contacting warmer water creates fog. This creates a
favorable habitat for the giant redwoods of the northern California
coast.

### Surface Currents and Climate {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBDdXJyZW50cyBhbmQgQ2xpbWF0ZQ.._24-l5u}

Large ocean currents can have a big impact on climate, especially of
nearby coasts. The Equator and the poles have very different climates
today. But these regions woud be much more different without ocean
surface currents. These currents move heat around the globe. The best
known of these is the **Gulf Stream** , which warms parts of Europe. But
other currents also alter near-shore climates. Like the Gulf Stream, the
Kushiro Current warms Japan. Cooler currents that move from the polar
regions to the Equator also alter climate.

#### The Gulf Stream {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEd1bGYgU3RyZWFt_24-8p5}

The Gulf Stream carries warm water from near the Equator up the eastern
coast of North America. Look at the map below ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMTYtR3VsZi1TdHJlYW0.) ); it shows how
the Gulf Stream warms both the water and land along the coast.

water and land. The warm Gulf Stream can be seen snaking up eastern
North America.

</div>

The warm water then flows across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. The Gulf
Stream's warm waters raise temperatures in the North Sea. The warmer
ocean temperatures raise the air temperatures over land. The difference
is between 3 to 6°C (5 to 11°F). London, U.K., for example, is about six
degrees farther south than Quebec, Canada. However, London’s average
January temperature is nearly 16°C (28°F) warmer. London also gets a lot
of rain ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SYWlueUxvbmRvbg..) ). Air traveling
over the warm Gulf Stream water picks up moisture. Quebec is much drier
but much snowier ( **Figure**

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-n8a}

-   Water in the Gulf Stream warms as it travels along the Equator. The
    Gulf Stream brings warm water north along the United States. It then
    travels across the northern Atlantic to the British Isles.
-   The Gulf Stream creates a relatively warm wet climate for the
    British Isles. This compares with the frigid Quebec at about the
    same latitude.
-   Ocean currents transfer heat from the Equator toward the poles. This
    moderates Earth's temperature.

**Why do small fish live in upwelling zones?**

Seawater is always on the move. Water that comes up to the surface from
deep is rich with nutrients. Plankton gather where nutrients are
plentiful. Small fish come to eat the plankton. Of course, larger fish
and birds come to eat the smaller fish. So upwelling is responsible for
an abundance of life.

### Deep Currents {#7.html#x-ck12-RGVlcCBDdXJyZW50cw.._25-euq}

Currents also flow deep below the surface of the ocean. **Deep
currents** are caused by differences in density at the top and bottom.
More dense water takes up less space than less dense water. It has the
same mass but less volume. Water that is more dense sinks. Less dense
water rises. What can make water more dense?

#### Downwelling {#7.html#x-ck12-RG93bndlbGxpbmc._25-ojm}

Water becomes more dense when it is colder and when it has more salt. In
the North Atlantic Ocean, cold winds chill the water at the surface. Sea
ice grows in this cold water, but ice is created from fresh water. The
salt is left behind in the seawater. This cold, salty water is very
dense, so it sinks to the bottom of the North Atlantic. **Downwelling**
can take place in other places where surface water becomes very dense (
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMTctT2NlYW4tQ3VycmVudHM.)
).

**Figure 7.63**

Deep currents flow because of differences in density of ocean water.

</div>

When water sinks it pushes deep water along at the bottom of the ocean.
This water circulates through all of the ocean basins in deep currents.

#### Upwelling {#7.html#x-ck12-VXB3ZWxsaW5n_25-kol}

Sometimes deep ocean water rises to the surface. This is called
**upwelling** . The figure below shows why it happens ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMTgtVXB3ZWxsaW5n) ). Strong winds
blow surface water away from shore. This allows deeper water to flow to
the surface and take its place.

upwelling](ck12_7_files/20150911025805988356.jpeg "Diagram of upwelling")

**Figure 7.64**

An upwelling occurs when deep ocean water rises to the surface.

</div>

When water comes up from the deep, it brings a lot of nutrients with it.
Why is deep water so full of nutrients? Over time, dead organisms and
other organic matter settle to the bottom water and collect. The
nutrient-rich water that comes to the surface by upwelling supports many
living things.

An animation of upwelling is seen here:
[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/currents/03coastal4.html](03coastal4.html)
.

Upwelling also takes place along the Equator. Winds blow the surface
water north and south. This leaves a void that deep water can upwell
into. The nutrients rise to the surface and support a great deal of life
in the equatorial oceans.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-6oo}

-   Cooling or evaporation of fresh water from the sea surface makes
    surface water dense. This causes the surface water to
    undergo downwelling.
-   Downwelling of cold, dense water pushes deep water along. This
    drives thermohaline circulation.
-   Upwelling takes place at some coastlines or along the Equator.
    Upwelling brings cool, nutrient-rich water to the surface.

**When is trash in the oceans good?**

Well, not good exactly, but useful. In 1992 a ship lost 28,000 plastic
bath toys in the North Pacific. Oceanographers sent out word and people
alerted them when they found the toys on beaches. The oceanographers
used these findings to map ocean currents.

### Ocean Water Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4gV2F0ZXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_26-5zd}

The oceans are vast. You might think they are too big to be harmed by
pollution. But that’s not the case. Ocean water is becoming seriously
polluted. This pollution affects the coasts. It even affects the seas
far from shore.

#### Coastal Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29hc3RhbCBQb2xsdXRpb24._26-5ng}

The oceans are most polluted along coasts. Why do you think that's the
case? Of course, it's because most pollution enters the oceans from the
land. Runoff and rivers carry the majority of pollution into the ocean.
Many cities dump their **wastewater** , water mixed with waste, directly
into coastal waters. In some parts of the world, raw sewage and trash
may be thrown into the water ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMTItcG9sbHV0ZWQtY29hc3RhbC13YXRlcg..)
). Coastal water may become so polluted that people get sick if they
swim in it or eat seafood from it. The polluted water may also kill fish
and other ocean life.

![Beach filled with
garbage](ck12_7_files/20150911025806175562.jpeg "Beach filled with garbage")

**Figure 7.65**

This coastal ocean water is full of trash and sewage.

</div>

Much of the trash in the oceans is plastic. Many types of plastic do not
degrade. Some break down into plastic molecules, but these can also be a
pollutant. Plastic shopping bags are extremely abundant in the oceans.
Since water runs from land into the sea, chemicals can end up in the
sea. Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers are among the chemicals.

#### Open Water Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-T3BlbiBXYXRlciBQb2xsdXRpb24._26-v5g}

Most of the trash that is in the oceans comes from the land. About 20%
comes from ships. Trash is thrown overboard by many vessels. Fishing
boats throw over lines and nets.

There is a very large patch of garbage known as the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch. Trash from the lands all around the North Pacific gets
caught up in currents. The currents bring the trash into the center of
the North Pacific Gyre. The concentration of trash increases toward the
center of the gyre.

While recognizable pieces of garbage are visible, much of the trash is
tiny plastic molecules. The molecules are invisible but are seen in
water samples. Plastic confetti-like pieces are also found in the gyre.

The size of the garbage patch is unknown, since it can’t be seen from
above. Some people estimate that it’s twice the size of continental U.S,
with a mass of 100 million tons.

#### Effect on Organisms {#7.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0IG9uIE9yZ2FuaXNtcw.._26-n9c}

Animals can be harmed or killed by trash in the oceans. Seabirds and
mammals may sometimes accidentally eat plastic bags. This may kill the
animals. Fishing nets can entangle fish and other animals so that they
cannot escape. Plastic molecules are ingested by organisms. Some that
filter water for nutrients may take in a lot of plastic molecules. They
may eventually die. Larger fish or humans eat them and may take in the
plastics too. Some of the plastics may absorb harmful chemicals.

</div>

#### Reducing Ocean Pollution {#7.html#x-ck12-UmVkdWNpbmcgT2NlYW4gUG9sbHV0aW9u_26-3av}

Everyone can help to keep trash from entering the ocean. Reduce your use
of plastics, especially plastic bags. Dispose of trash and chemicals
properly. Be sure that coastal communities dispose of trash safely. If
you're on a ship, do not dump trash overboard in sensitive locations. Be
sure that ships obey laws that protect the seas.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-4oa}

-   Most ocean pollution comes from land and most is found near
    the coasts. Most of this trash is plastic.
-   Plastic trash does not usually biodegrade in the ocean. It breaks
    down into tiny plastic molecules.
-   Ocean pollutants are harmful to marine organisms.

**Can you see the oil in a big oil spill?**

Of course. The photo on the left shows the Gulf of Mexico oil spill
after oil has leaked for nearly one month. About a month later, about
twice as much oil had spilled into the Gulf, as seen on the left. The
water moves and so the oil moves with it.

### Oil Spills {#7.html#x-ck12-T2lsIFNwaWxscw.._27-3ru}

Oil spills are another source of ocean pollution. To get at oil buried
beneath the seafloor, oil rigs are built in the oceans. These rigs pump
oil from beneath the ocean floor. Huge ocean tankers carry oil around
the world. If something goes wrong with a rig on a tanker, millions of
barrels of oil may end up in the water. The oil may coat and kill ocean
animals. Some of the oil will wash ashore. This oil may destroy coastal
wetlands and ruin beaches.

#### The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEd1bGYgb2YgTWV4aWNvIE9pbCBTcGlsbA.._27-nrs}

The figure below shows workers trying to clean up oil on a Louisiana
beach ( **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjEtMTMtb2lsLXNwaWxsLWNsZWFudXA.) ). The
oil washed ashore after a deadly oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico
in 2010.

**Figure 7.67**

After an oil rig explosion, hundreds of miles of beaches looked like
this one. Cleaning them up was a huge task.

</div>

New drilling techniques allow oil companies to drill in deeper waters
than ever before. In April 2010 a rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded.
Eleven workers were killed and 17 injured. When the drill rig sank, a
pipe was disconnected and oil gushed into the Gulf. Three months later
the well was capped. But 4.9 million barrels had entered the Gulf, about
16 times more oil than the largest oil spill to date.

#### Cleanup {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xlYW51cA.._27-3uk}

Once the oil is in the water, there are three ways to try to clean it:

1.  Removal: Corral and then burn the oil.
2.  Containment: Use containment booms to trap the oil.
3.  Dispersal: Use chemicals to get the oil to disperse, called
    **chemical dispersants** . Some scientists think that the harm to
    the environment from the dispersants is as great as the harm from
    the oil.

The total effect of the oil spill on the environment of the Gulf is not
yet known. Oil is found in the sediments on the seafloor. Many people
who fish or are involved in Gulf tourism were also impacted. Studies of
the effects of the oil spill on people and animals will continue for
many years.

### What You Can Do {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBZb3UgQ2FuIERv_27-oqq}

Small amounts of oil leak into the oceans from wells or ships. By
reducing the amount of oil and gas you use, you decrease the need for
these commodities. Also, be sure to dispose of motor oil correctly.
Motor oil poured down a sewage grate can end up in the sea. It's
important to be sure that companies follow environmental regulations.
They must also be cautious when they drill or transport oil in the
oceans. People can demand that companies protect the ocean environment.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-l8g}

-   Most ocean pollution comes from land and most is found near
    the coasts. Most of this trash is plastic.
-   Plastic trash does not usually biodegrade in the ocean but just
    forms tiny plastic molecules.
-   Massive amounts of oil that have been spilled into a water body can
    be removed, contained, or dispersed. This is not easy or complete.

## Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-5ef}

Water is found on Earth as a gas, liquid and solid. Water as a gas is
mostly in the atmosphere. Water as a solid is found as ice floating on
ponds, as frost on a car, or in glaciers, among other places. Glaciers
move, by definition, although they do it very slowly. Liquid water moves
around the planet through streams, groundwater, lakes, ponds. Most of
Earth's liquid water is in the oceans. But it doesn't remain stagnant
there. Seawater moves in waves, tides, and currents. Some ocean water
changes state and becomes sea ice. Water may evaporate into the
atmosphere and become water vapor. Water sets Earth apart from the other
planets in the solar system. In fact, water in all three states is
probably exceedingly rare everywhere in the galaxy. Human activities
pollute water. Pollutants come from industrial, municipal and
agricultural sources. Water is protected from pollution by acts and
rules that guide people to protect water. Water can also be cleaned up
once it is polluted.

**How can Earth's atmosphere be in constant motion?**

Stand outside on a windy day and it's easy to see that Earth is a
dynamic planet. But being dynamic requires energy. Where does that
energy come from? In the atmosphere, it comes from the Sun. Solar energy
provides the power needed for the atmosphere to move.

**Why is the Atmosphere Important?**

Why is Earth the only planet in the solar system known to have life? The
main reason is Earth’s atmosphere. Organisms need the gases in the
atmosphere to live. Water is also essential for life. Water vapor is one
of the gases in the atmosphere. Green algae, like in this photo, are
primitive life.

### The Atmosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmU.-myg}

The **atmosphere** is a mixture of gases that surrounds the planet. We
also call it air. The gases in the atmosphere include nitrogen, oxygen,
and carbon dioxide. Along with water vapor, the atmosphere allows life
to survive. Without it, Earth would be a harsh, barren world.

#### Why the Atmosphere Is Important {#8.html#x-ck12-V2h5IHRoZSBBdG1vc3BoZXJlIElzIEltcG9ydGFudA..-jf6}

We are lucky to have an atmosphere on Earth. The atmosphere supports
life and is also needed for the water cycle and weather. The gases of
the atmosphere even allow us to hear.

#### The Atmosphere and Living Things {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIExpdmluZyBUaGluZ3M.-b4d}

Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen, but it doesn't do much. Carbon
dioxide and oxygen are the gases in the atmosphere that are needed for
life.

-   Plants need carbon dioxide for **photosynthesis** . They use
    sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water into food. The process
    releases oxygen. Without photosynthesis, there would be very little
    oxygen in the air.
-   Other living things depend on plants for food. These organisms need
    the oxygen plants release to get energy out of the food. Even plants
    need oxygen for this purpose.

#### The Atmosphere and the Sun’s Rays {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIHRoZSBTdW7igJlzIFJheXM.-aow}

The atmosphere protects living things from the Sun’s most harmful rays.
Gases reflect or absorb the strongest rays of sunlight ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMDEtU29sYXItcmF5cw..) ).

The atmosphere shields Earth from the most harmful solar rays.

</div>

#### The Atmosphere and Earth’s Temperature {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIEVhcnRo4oCZcyBUZW1wZXJhdHVyZQ..-iob}

Gases in the atmosphere surround Earth like a blanket. They keep the
temperature in a range that can support life. The gases keep out some of
the Sun’s scorching heat during the day. At night, they hold the heat
close to the surface, so it doesn’t radiate out into space.

#### The Atmosphere and Earth’s Water {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIEVhcnRo4oCZcyBXYXRlcg..-f0h}

The image below shows the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle (
**Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMDItUm9sZS1vZi10aGUtYXRtb3NwaGVyZQ..)
). Water vapor rises from Earth’s surface into the atmosphere. As it
rises, it cools. The water vapor may then condense into water droplets
and form clouds. If enough water droplets collect in clouds, they may
come together to form droplets. The droplets will fall as rain. This how
freshwater gets from the atmosphere back to Earth's surface.

**Figure 8.2**

The atmosphere is a big part of the water cycle. What do you think would
happen to Earth’s water without it?

</div>

#### The Atmosphere and Weather {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIFdlYXRoZXI.-rmo}

Without the atmosphere, there would be no clouds or rain. In fact, there
would be no weather at all. Most weather occurs because the atmosphere
heats up more in some places than others.

#### The Atmosphere and Weathering {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIFdlYXRoZXJpbmc.-tdu}

Weather makes life interesting. Weather also causes weathering.
Weathering is the slow wearing down of rocks on Earth’s surface.
Wind-blown sand scours rocks like sandpaper. Glaciers of ice scrape
across rock surfaces like a file. Even gentle rain may seep into rocks
and slowly dissolve them. If the water freezes, it expands. This
eventually causes the rocks to crack. Without the atmosphere, none of
this weathering would happen. Rocks at the surface would be pristine and
unaltered.

#### The Atmosphere and Sound {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmUgYW5kIFNvdW5k-sa6}

**Sound** is a form of energy that travels in waves. Sound waves cannot
travel through empty space, but they can travel through gases. Gases in
the air allow us to hear most of the sounds in our world. Because of
air, you can hear birds singing, horns tooting, and friends laughing.
Without the atmosphere, the world would be a silent, eerie place.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-uwc}

-   The atmosphere is made of gases that are essential for
    photosynthesis and other life activities.
-   The atmosphere is a crucial part of the water cycle. It is an
    important reservoir for water, and the source of precipitation.
-   The atmosphere moderates Earth's temperature. Weather takes place in
    the atmosphere.
-   Without air, Earth would be silent.

**Just what is air?**

Air is easy to forget about. We usually can’t see it, taste it, or smell
it. We can only feel it when it moves. But air is actually made of
molecules of many different gases. It also contains tiny particles of
solid matter.

### Gases in Air {#8.html#x-ck12-R2FzZXMgaW4gQWly_1-p09}

The figure below shows the main gases in air ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMDMtR2FzZXMtaW4tdGhlLWF0bW9zcGhlcmU.)
). Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of air. Argon and carbon dioxide make
up much of the rest. These percentages are the same just about
everywhere in the atmosphere.

**Figure 8.3**

This graph identifies the most common gases in air.

</div>

Air also includes water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from
place to place. That’s why water vapor isn’t included in the figure
above. It can make up as much as 4% of the air.

#### Water Vapor {#8.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgVmFwb3I._1-cvk}

**Humidity** is the amount of water vapor in the air. Humidity varies
from place to place. It also varies in the same place from season to
season. On a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, humidity is high. The air
feels very heavy and sticky. On a winter day in Flagstaff, Arizona,
humidity is low. The air sucks moisture out of your nose and lips.
Humidity can change rapidly if a storm comes in. Humidity can vary over
a short distance, like near a lake. Even when humidity is at its
highest, water vapor makes up only about 4% of the atmosphere.

#### Greenhouse Gases {#8.html#x-ck12-R3JlZW5ob3VzZSBHYXNlcw.._1-mv8}

Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. This is essential so that
Earth has a more moderate temperature. Without greenhouse gases,
nighttime temperatures would be frigid. Natural greenhouse gases include
carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. CFCs and some other
man-made compounds are also greenhouse gases. Human activities may
increase the amount of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, in the
atmosphere.

#### Particles in the Air {#8.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljbGVzIGluIHRoZSBBaXI._1-xun}

Air includes many tiny particles. The **particulates** may consist of
dust, soil, salt, smoke, or ash. Some particulates pollute the air and
may make it unhealthy to breathe. But having particles in the air is
very important. Tiny particles are needed for water vapor to condense
on. Without particles, water vapor could not condense. Then clouds could
not form, and Earth would have no rain.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-oh1}

-   The major atmospheric gases are nitrogen and oxygen. The atmosphere
    also contains minor amounts of other gases, including
    carbon dioxide.
-   Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. These gases include
    carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone.
-   Not everything in the atmosphere is gas. Particulates are particles
    that are important as the nucleus of raindrops and snowflakes.

**Have your ears ever popped?**

If your ears have ever "popped," you have experienced a change in air
pressure. Ears "pop" because the air pressure is different on the inside
and the outside of your ears.

### Properties of Air {#8.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBBaXI._2-z5m}

We usually can’t sense the air around us unless it is moving. But air
has the same basic properties as other matter. For example, air has
mass, volume, and, of course, density.

#### Density of Air {#8.html#x-ck12-RGVuc2l0eSBvZiBBaXI._2-p9r}

**Density** is mass per unit volume. Density is a measure of how closely
molecules are packed together. The closer together they are, the greater
the density. Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or
spread out.

The density of air varies from place to place. Air density depends on
several factors. One is temperature. Like other materials, warm air is
less dense than cool air. Since warmer molecules have more energy, they
are more active. The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart.
Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude.

#### Altitude and Density {#8.html#x-ck12-QWx0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIERlbnNpdHk._2-c5a}

**Altitude** is height above sea level. The density of air decreases
with height. There are two reasons: at higher altitudes, there is less
air pushing down from above, and gravity is weaker farther from Earth's
center. So at higher altitudes, air molecules can spread out more, and
air density decreases ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMDQtQ29sdW1uLW9mLWFpcg..) ).

**Figure 8.4**

This drawing represents a column of air. The column rises from sea level
to the top of the atmosphere. Where does air have the greatest density?

</div>

#### Air Pressure {#8.html#x-ck12-QWlyIFByZXNzdXJl_2-9je}

Because air is a gas, its molecules have a lot of energy. Air molecules
move a lot and bump into things. For this reason, they exert pressure.
**Air pressure** is defined as the weight of the air pressing against a
given area.

At sea level, the atmosphere presses down with a force of about 1
kilogram per square centimeter (14.76 pounds per square inch). If you
are standing at sea level, you have more than a ton of air pressing
against you. Why doesn’t the pressure crush you? Air presses in all
directions at once. Other molecules of air are pushing back.

#### Altitude and Air Pressure {#8.html#x-ck12-QWx0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIEFpciBQcmVzc3VyZQ.._2-c38}

Like density, the pressure of the air decreases with altitude. There is
less air pressing down from above the higher up you go. Look at the
bottle pictured below ( **Figure**

**Did you know that you can see the layers of the atmosphere?**

The layers of the atmosphere appear as different colors in this image
from the International Space Station. Imagine looking out the window at
a view like that!

### Air Temperature {#8.html#x-ck12-QWlyIFRlbXBlcmF0dXJl_3-6lc}

The atmosphere has layers. The layers correspond with how temperature
changes with altitude. By understanding the way temperature changes with
altitude, we can learn a lot about how the atmosphere works.

#### Warm Air Rises {#8.html#x-ck12-V2FybSBBaXIgUmlzZXM._3-urg}

This is really important: Warm air rises. Why does warm air rise (
**Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-RVMtY29udmVjdGlvbg..) )? Gas molecules
are able to move freely. Gas molecules move more at higher temperatures.
They can take up as much space as is available.

-   When gas molecules are cool, they are sluggish. They take up
    less space. With the same number of molecules in less space, both
    air density and air pressure are higher.
-   When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously. They take up
    more space. Air density and air pressure are lower.

Warmer, lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it. So the
warm air rises. The cooler air is denser than the air beneath it. So it
sinks down. This is convection: warm air rises, and cool air sinks. Warm
fluids can undergo convection as well. This is described in the chapter
*Plate Tectonics* .

#### Temperature Gradient {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgR3JhZGllbnQ._3-xkn}

Air temperature changes with altitude. This does not occur in the same
way as pressure and density, which decrease with altitude. Changes in
air temperature are not regular. A change in temperature with distance
is called a **temperature gradient** .

#### Temperature of the Atmosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgb2YgdGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmU._3-e2g}

Air temperature changes as altitude increases. In some layers of the
atmosphere, the temperature decreases. In other layers, it increases (
**Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMTItQXRtb3NwaGVyZS1sYXllcnM.) ).
Refer to this figure as you read about the layers in the coming
concepts.

**What if we took a field trip to the troposphere?**

A field trip to the troposphere could start below sea level in Badwater
Basin in Death Valley. It could end at the top of Mt. Everest at 29,029
feet (8,848m). In other words, every human activity that's in air is in
the troposphere. You might say that your life is a field trip to the
troposphere!

### Troposphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VHJvcG9zcGhlcmU._4-qpx}

The **troposphere** is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. All of the
air you breathe is in the troposphere. All of Earth's weather—wind,
rain, snow, heat—is in the troposphere. The troposphere is the lowest
and most important layer of the atmosphere!

#### Properties of the Troposphere {#8.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiB0aGUgVHJvcG9zcGhlcmU._4-i82}

The troposphere is the shortest layer of the atmosphere. It rises to
only about 12 kilometers (7 miles) above the surface. Even so, this
layer holds 75% of all the gas molecules in the atmosphere. That’s
because the air is densest in this layer.

In the troposphere, temperature decreases with altitude. The troposphere
gets some of its heat directly from the Sun. Most, however, comes from
Earth's surface. The surface is heated by the Sun. Some of that heat
radiates back into the air. This makes the temperature higher near the
surface than at higher altitudes.

#### Mixing of Air {#8.html#x-ck12-TWl4aW5nIG9mIEFpcg.._4-hvt}

Air in the troposphere is warmer closer to Earth’s surface. Warm air is
less dense than cool air, so it rises higher in the troposphere. This
starts a convection cell. Convection mixes the air in the troposphere.
Rising air is also a main cause of weather. All of Earth’s weather takes
place in the troposphere.

#### Temperature Inversion {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgSW52ZXJzaW9u_4-4tl}

Sometimes air doesn’t mix in the troposphere. This happens when air is
cooler close to the ground than it is above. The cool air is dense, so
it stays near the ground. This is called a temperature **inversion** (
**Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMTMtVGVtcGVyYXR1cmUtaW52ZXJzaW9u) ).
An inversion can trap air pollution near the surface. Temperature
inversions are more common in the winter. Can you explain why?

</div>

#### Tropopause {#8.html#x-ck12-VHJvcG9wYXVzZQ.._4-igd}

At the top of the troposphere is a thin layer of air called the
tropopause. This layer acts as a barrier. It prevents cool air in the
troposphere from mixing with warm air in the stratosphere.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-1im}

-   In the troposphere, warm air ordinarily sits below cooler air.
-   With a temperature inversion, cold air sits below warm air. This
    traps the cold air because it cannot rise into the warm air.
-   An inversion starts over land at night or in the winter, or near
    the coast.

**Can we take a field trip to the stratosphere?**

Sure we can! If you've ever flown on a jet airplane, you've been in the
stratosphere. Airplanes fly in the stratosphere, because there is less
friction. They get better gas mileage and so costs are lower. There is
also less turbulence, so passengers are happier. Can you identify the
bottom of the stratosphere in the photo? It's where the clouds begin.
Remember that all weather is in the troposphere.

### Stratosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-U3RyYXRvc3BoZXJl_5-bjv}

The **stratosphere** is the layer above the troposphere. The layer rises
to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface.

#### Temperature in the Stratosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgaW4gdGhlIFN0cmF0b3NwaGVyZQ.._5-rux}

Air temperature in the stratosphere increases with altitude. Why? The
stratosphere gets most of its heat from the Sun. Therefore, it’s warmer
closer to the Sun. The air at the bottom of the stratosphere is cold.
The cold air is dense, so it doesn’t rise. As a result, there is little
mixing of air in this layer.

#### The Ozone Layer {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE96b25lIExheWVy_5-1tk}

The previous section said that the troposphere is the most important
layer of the atmosphere. But it's not the only important layer. The
stratosphere contains a layer of ozone gas. **Ozone** consists of three
oxygen atoms (O ~3~ ). The **ozone layer** is in the stratosphere. Ozone
in the layer absorbs high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV
radiation splits the ozone molecule ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMTQtT3pvbmUtbGF5ZXI.) ). The split
creates an oxygen molecule (O ~2~ ) and an oxygen atom (O). This split
releases heat that warms the stratosphere. By absorbing UV radiation,
ozone also protects Earth’s surface. UV radiation would harm living
things without the ozone layer.

#### Stratopause {#8.html#x-ck12-U3RyYXRvcGF1c2U._5-lxz}

At the top of the stratosphere is a thin layer called the stratopause.
It acts as a boundary between the stratosphere and the mesosphere.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-iis}

-   There is little mixing between the troposphere and the stratosphere.
-   Ozone gas protects life on Earth from harmful UV light.
-   The ozone layer is in the stratosphere. It has a higher
    concentration of ozone than the rest of the atmosphere.

**Next up: A field trip to the mesosophere!**

Not so fast. The mesosphere is the least known layer of the atmosphere.
The mesosphere lies above the highest altitude an airplane can go. It
lies below the lowest altitude a spacecraft can orbit. Maybe that's just
as well. If you were in the mesosphere without a space suit, your blood
would boil! This is because the pressure is so low that liquids would
boil at normal body temperature.

### Mesosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-TWVzb3NwaGVyZQ.._6-x2e}

The **mesosphere** is the layer above the stratosphere. It rises to
about 85 kilometers (53 miles) above the surface. Temperature decreases
with altitude in this layer.

#### Temperature in the Mesosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgaW4gdGhlIE1lc29zcGhlcmU._6-w0t}

There are very few gas molecules in the mesosphere. This means that
there is little matter to absorb the Sun’s rays and heat the air. Most
of the heat that enters the mesosphere comes from the stratosphere
below. That’s why the mesosphere is warmest at the bottom.

#### Meteors in the Mesosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-TWV0ZW9ycyBpbiB0aGUgTWVzb3NwaGVyZQ.._6-klf}

Did you ever see a meteor shower ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QZXJzZWlkTWV0ZW9yU2hvd2Vy) )? Meteors
burn as they fall through the mesosphere. The space rocks experience
friction with the gas molecules. The friction makes the meteors get very
hot. Many meteors burn up completely in the mesosphere.

#### Red Sprites and Blue Jets {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVkIFNwcml0ZXMgYW5kIEJsdWUgSmV0cw.._6-pko}

Red sprites and blue jets are electrical discharges ( **Figure**

not the same thing as lightning. They more closely resemble the
discharges seen in fluorescent tubes. These events occur much higher up
in the atmosphere than lightning.

#### Polar Mesospheric Clouds {#8.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgTWVzb3NwaGVyaWMgQ2xvdWRz_6-3ng}

Clouds in the mesosphere are very rare. The ones that exist occur near
the poles. The clouds are called **polar mesospheric clouds** . At the
edge of these clouds are noctilucent clouds ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ob2N0aWx1Y2VudENsb3Vkcw..) ). They are
forming more often now, perhaps as a result of climate change.

#### Mesopause {#8.html#x-ck12-TWVzb3BhdXNl_6-yjc}

At the top of the mesosphere is the mesopause. Temperatures here are
colder than anywhere else in the atmosphere. They are as low as -100° C
(-212° F)! Nowhere on Earth’s surface is it that cold.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-r2d}

-   The mesosphere has a very low density of gas molecules.
-   Temperature decreases in the mesosphere with altitude. This is
    because the heat source is the stratosphere.
-   The mesosphere has red sprites, blue jets, and two types of clouds.
-   The mesosphere is no place for human life!

**Can you take a field trip to the thermosphere? Maybe some day!**

The inhabitants of the International Space Station and other space
stations live in the thermosphere. They are not directly in the
thermosphere, of course. They must be inside the station or inside a
space suit at all times. Maybe some day you will join them!

### Thermosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlcm1vc3BoZXJl_7-sz0}

The **thermosphere** is the layer above the mesosphere. It rises to 600
kilometers (372 miles) above the surface. The International Space
Station and other space stations orbit Earth in this layer.

#### Temperature in the Thermosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgaW4gdGhlIFRoZXJtb3NwaGVyZQ.._7-hep}

Temperature increases with altitude in the thermosphere. Surprisingly,
it may be higher than 1000° C (1800° F) near the top of this layer! The
Sun’s energy there is very strong. The molecules absorb the Sun’s energy
and are heated up. But there are so few gas molecules that the air still
feels very cold. Molecules in the thermosphere gain or lose electrons.
They then become charged particles called ions.

#### Magnetosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-TWFnbmV0b3NwaGVyZQ.._7-lci}

Earth's **magnetosphere** is controlled by the magnetic field. The
magnetosphere protects the planet from the **solar wind** . The solar
wind is ions that fly from the Sun to Earth very fast. The magnetosphere
protects Earth's ozone layer. So life on Earth needs the protection of
the magnetosphere.

#### Northern and Southern Lights {#8.html#x-ck12-Tm9ydGhlcm4gYW5kIFNvdXRoZXJuIExpZ2h0cw.._7-6vi}

Have you ever seen a brilliant light show in the night sky? Sometimes
the ions in the thermosphere glow at night. Storms on the Sun energize
the ions and make them light up. In the Northern Hemisphere, the lights
are called the northern lights, or aurora borealis. In the Southern
Hemisphere, they are called southern lights, or aurora australis. They
are referred to together as the **aurora** ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BdXJvcmFGcm9tRWFydGg.) and **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BdXJvcmFGcm9tU3BhY2U.) ).

### Exosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-RXhvc3BoZXJl_7-i2i}

The **exosphere** is the layer above the thermosphere. This is the top
of the atmosphere. The exosphere has no real upper limit; it just
gradually merges with outer space. Gas molecules are very far apart in
this layer, but they are really hot. Earth’s gravity is so weak in the
exosphere that gas molecules sometimes just float off into space.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-70v}

-   The solar wind is made of high speed particles from the Sun. The
    magnetosphere protects Earth from the solar wind.
-   Particles from the Sun energize ions in the thermosphere. This
    creates the northern and southern lights.
-   Gas molecules are exceedingly rare in the exosphere.

**Where can you find energy?**

Picture yourself sitting by the campfire. You and your family are using
the fire to stay warm on a chilly evening. As the Sun goes down, the air
gets colder. You move closer to the fire. Heat from the fire warms you.
Light from the fire allows you to see your relatives. Maybe you put
marshmallows on a stick and roast them. Yum.

### What Is Energy? {#8.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBFbmVyZ3k__8-woa}

What explains all of these events? The answer can be summed up in one
word: energy. **Energy** is defined as the ability to do work. Doing
anything takes energy. A campfire obviously has energy. You can feel its
heat and see its light. You can use its energy to cook food.

#### Forms of Energy {#8.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybXMgb2YgRW5lcmd5_8-zci}

Heat and light from the campfire are forms of energy. There are many
other forms of energy. Here are a few that are important in Earth
science:

-   chemical energy: Energy that is let off after a chemical reaction.
-   luminous energy: Also called light.
-   nuclear energy: Energy that is let off when the atom of a nucleus
    is split.
-   radiant energy: Energy of electromagnetic radiation. This is the
    topic of the concept "Solar Energy on Earth."
-   sound energy: Energy from sound waves.
-   thermal energy: Also called heat.

#### Conservation of Energy {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmF0aW9uIG9mIEVuZXJneQ.._8-meu}

Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can change form. For example,
a piece of wood has chemical energy stored in its molecules. When the
wood burns, the chemical energy changes to heat energy and light energy.

Lightning converts electric potential energy into three kinds of energy.
They are light energy, sound energy, and thermal energy.

You convert food energy to movement ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HaXJsUnVubmluZ1dpdGhBcHBsZQ..) ).
That's another way energy is transferred from one form to another!

**Figure 8.15**

If the girl eats this apple it will provide the energy needed for her to
run.

</div>

#### Movement of Energy {#8.html#x-ck12-TW92ZW1lbnQgb2YgRW5lcmd5_8-n4o}

Energy can move from one place to another. It can travel through space
or matter. That’s why you can feel the heat of a campfire and see its
light. These forms of energy travel from the campfire to you.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-voz}

-   Energy is the ability to do work.
-   Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can only change forms.
-   Energy can change from one type to more than one type. For example,
    electric potential energy before a lightning strike can turn into
    light, sound, and heat.

**Just how important is this star?**

Almost all energy at Earth's surface comes from the Sun. The Sun’s
energy heats the planet and the air around it. This causes the
atmosphere to move and create weather. Sunlight also powers
photosynthesis and life on Earth.

### The Sun's Energy {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN1bidzIEVuZXJneQ.._9-jzf}

Most of the energy at Earth's surface comes from the Sun. Solar energy
travels in tiny packets that move in waves. The waves have different
wavelengths. Waves with different wavelengths carry different amounts of
energy.

#### Photons of Energy {#8.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9ucyBvZiBFbmVyZ3k._9-weu}

The Sun gives off energy in tiny packets called **photons** . Photons
travel in waves. These waves make up **electromagnetic radiation** . The
image below models a wave of light ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XYXZlbGVuZ3Ro) ). Notice the
wavelength in the figure. Waves with shorter wavelengths have more
energy.

#### Electromagnetic Spectrum {#8.html#x-ck12-RWxlY3Ryb21hZ25ldGljIFNwZWN0cnVt_9-bxf}

Energy from the Sun has a wide range of wavelengths. The total range of
energy is called the **electromagnetic spectrum** ( **Figure**

**Figure 8.17**

Compare the wavelengths of radio waves and gamma rays. Which type of
wave has more energy?

</div>

**Visible light** is the only light that humans can see. Different
wavelengths of visible light appear as different colors. Radio waves
have the longest wavelengths. They also have the least amount of energy.
**Infrared light** has wavelengths too long for humans to see, but we
can feel them as heat. The atmosphere absorbs the infrared light.
**Ultraviolet (UV) light** is in wavelengths too short for humans to
see. The most energetic UV light is harmful to life. The atmosphere
absorbs most of this UV light from the Sun. Gamma rays have the highest
energy, and they are the most damaging rays. Fortunately, gamma rays
don’t penetrate Earth’s atmosphere.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-syf}

-   Ultraviolet radiation has the highest energy; infrared the lowest.
-   Solar energy travels in photons. Photons travel in waves, which make
    up electromagnetic radiation.

**Can you see energy moving?**

It's hard to see energy moving. But energy is the reason that air moves,
and it is sometimes possible to see that. In this photo, differences in
temperature are causing air to move—in fantastic ways!

### How Energy Moves Through the Atmosphere {#8.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVuZXJneSBNb3ZlcyBUaHJvdWdoIHRoZSBBdG1vc3BoZXJl_10-rbp}

Energy travels through space or material. Heat energy is transferred in
three ways: radiation, conduction, and convection.

#### Radiation {#8.html#x-ck12-UmFkaWF0aW9u_10-iq8}

**Radiation** is the transfer of energy by waves. Energy can travel as
electromagnetic waves through air or empty space. The Sun's energy
travels through space by radiation. After sunlight heats the planet's
surface, some heat radiates back into the atmosphere.

#### Conduction {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29uZHVjdGlvbg.._10-2ai}

In **conduction** , heat is transferred from molecule to molecule by
contact. Warmer molecules vibrate faster than cooler ones. They bump
into the cooler molecules. When they do, they transfer some of their
energy. Conduction happens mainly in the lower atmosphere. Can you
explain why?

#### Convection {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29udmVjdGlvbg.._10-3vv}

**Convection** is the transfer of heat by a current. Convection happens
in a liquid or a gas. Air near the ground is warmed by heat radiating
from Earth's surface. The warm air is less dense, so it rises. As it
rises, it cools. The cool air is dense, so it sinks to the surface. This
creates a convection current ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMDktQ29udmVuY3Rpb24tY3VycmVudA..) ).
Convection is the most important way that heat travels in the
atmosphere.

**Figure 8.18**

atmosphere. Why does warm air rise?

</div>

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-dw3}

-   In conduction, heat moves from areas of more heat to areas of
    less heat. The substances must be in direct contact.
-   In convection, materials move depending on their heat relative to
    nearby materials.
-   In radiation, energy moves by waves.

**This is Antarctica. What season is this?**

The Sun is always up, even in the middle of the night. That's the photo
on the left. In the day, the Sun never gets too high in the sky. That's
the photo on the right. So, this is summer. In the winter, it's just
dark in Antarctica.

### Energy and Latitude {#8.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IGFuZCBMYXRpdHVkZQ.._11-lne}

Different parts of Earth’s surface receive different amounts of sunlight
( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMgRVMtMTUtMTAtU3VuLXJheXMtYW5kLWxhdGl0dWRl) ).
The Sun’s rays strike Earth’s surface most directly at the Equator. This
focuses the rays on a small area. Near the poles, the Sun’s rays strike
the surface at a slant. This spreads the rays over a wide area. The more
focused the rays are, the more energy an area receives, and the warmer
it is.

**Figure 8.19**

The lowest latitudes get the most energy from the Sun. The highest
latitudes get the least.

</div>

The difference in solar energy received at different latitudes drives
**atmospheric circulation** . Places that get more solar energy have
more heat. Places that get less solar energy have less heat. Warm air
rise, and cool air sinks. These principles mean that air moves around
the planet. The heat moves around the globe in certain ways. This
determines the way the atmosphere moves.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-nsb}

-   A lot of the solar energy that reaches Earth hits the Equator.
-   Much less solar energy gets to the poles.

**How does the atmosphere resemble a greenhouse?**

Farmers use greenhouses to extend the growing season. A greenhouse traps
heat. Days that are too cool for a growing plant can be made to be just
right. Similar to a greenhouse, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere keep
Earth warm.

### The Greenhouse Effect {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdyZWVuaG91c2UgRWZmZWN0_12-i3l}

When sunlight heats Earth’s surface, some of the heat radiates back into
the atmosphere. Some of this heat is absorbed by gases in the
atmosphere. This is the **greenhouse effect** , and it helps to keep
Earth warm. The greenhouse effect allows Earth to have temperatures that
can support life.

Gases that absorb heat in the atmosphere are called **greenhouse gases**
. They include carbon dioxide and water vapor. Human actions have
increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMTEtR3JlZW5ob3VzZS1lZmZlY3Rz) ). The

Human actions have increased the natural greenhouse effect.

</div>

Like a blanket on a sleeping person, greenhouse gases act as insulation
for the planet. The warming of the atmosphere is because of
**insulation** by greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are the component
of the atmosphere that moderate Earth’s temperatures.

#### Greenhouse Gases {#8.html#x-ck12-R3JlZW5ob3VzZSBHYXNlcw.._12-vuj}

Greenhouse gases include CO ~2~ , H ~2~ O, methane, O ~3~ , nitrous
oxides (NO and NO ~2~ ), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). All are a
normal part of the atmosphere except CFCs. The table below shows how
each greenhouse gas naturally enters the atmosphere ( **Table**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Z3JlZW5ob3VzZV9nYXNfZW50ZXJpbmdfdGhlX2F0bW9zcGhlcmU.)
).

  **Greenhouse Gas**    **Source**
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Carbon dioxide        Respiration, volcanic eruptions, decomposition of plant material; burning of fossil fuels
  Methane               Decomposition of plant material under some conditions, biochemical reactions in stomachs
  Nitrous oxide         Produced by bacteria
  Ozone                 Atmospheric processes
  Chlorofluorocarbons   Not naturally occurring; made by humans

Different greenhouse gases have different abilities to trap heat. For
example, one methane molecule traps 23 times as much heat as one CO ~2~
molecule. One CFC-12 molecule (a type of CFC) traps 10,600 times as much
heat as one CO ~2~ . Still, CO ~2~ is a very important greenhouse gas,
because it is much more abundant in the atmosphere.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-ttk}

-   Greenhouse gases include CO ~2~ , H ~2~ O, methane, O ~3~ , nitrous
    oxides (NO and NO ~2~ ), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
-   Greenhouse gases trap heat in the troposphere. Some greenhouse gases
    can trap more heat than others.
-   Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing due to
    human activities.

**Where can you go to experience wind?**

Wind is one of the most obviously dynamic features of our dynamic
planet. For a long time Mt. Washington in New Hampshire was known as the
windiest place on Earth. It no longer is called that, but it's still
plenty windy. A wind speed of 231 miles per hour was recorded on the
mountain in April 1934. In a 200 mph wind, you would not be able to
stand up. Temperatures due to wind chill would be outrageously cold!

### Atmospheric Circulation {#8.html#x-ck12-QXRtb3NwaGVyaWMgQ2lyY3VsYXRpb24._13-zqn}

**Wind** is just moving air. You can't really see it. Whether it’s a
gentle breeze or strong wind, you are most aware of air when it moves (
**Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMTktRWZmZWN0cy1vZi1haXItbW92ZW1lbnQ.)
). You can feel its molecules press against you. You can see things,
like dirt and leaves, moving in the wind. And you can see object moving,
like flags and trees, as a result of the wind.

</div>

#### Why Air Moves {#8.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEFpciBNb3Zlcw.._13-vdi}

Air movement takes place in the troposphere. This is the lowest layer of
the atmosphere. Air moves because of differences in heating. These
differences create convection currents and winds ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMjAtQ29udmVjdGlvbi1jdXJyZW50LWFuZC13aW5k)
).

-   Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises
    because it is light. The light, rising air creates an area of low
    air pressure at the surface.
-   The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The
    air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The sinking, heavy air
    creates an area of high air pressure near the ground.
-   Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of
    lower pressure. Air flowing over Earth’s surface is called
    **wind** . The greater the difference in pressure, the stronger the
    wind blows.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-7sq}

-   Warm air rises because it is less dense. This creates an area of
    low pressure.
-   Cool air sinks because it is denser. This creates an area of
    high pressure.
-   Wind blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.

**Which large rainstorms are crucial for people in some parts of the
world?**

India, Pakistan, and other nations in southern Asia are great places to
go to see monsoon rains. The region depends on the water they bring.
Parts of the Southwestern United States also receive monsoon rains.
These rains break the summer heat. They also provide water to desert
plants. With winter rains and summer rains, these deserts are more lush
than many.

### Local Winds {#8.html#x-ck12-TG9jYWwgV2luZHM._14-o2i}

Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area. Local winds blow
between small low and high pressure systems. They are influenced by
local geography. Nearness to an ocean, lake, or mountain range can
affect local winds. Some examples are found below. Local winds can
affect the weather and climate of a region.

#### Land and Sea Breezes {#8.html#x-ck12-TGFuZCBhbmQgU2VhIEJyZWV6ZXM._14-tng}

Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land. So the sea
surface is cooler than the land in the daytime. It is also cooler than
the land in the summer. The opposite is also true. The water stays
warmer than the land during the night and the winter. These differences
in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMjEtTGFuZC1hbmQtc2VhLWJyZWV6ZQ..) ).

-   A **sea breeze** blows from sea to land during the day or in summer.
    That’s when air over the land is warmer than air over the water. The
    warm air rises. Cool air from over the water flows in to take
    its place.
-   A **land breeze** blows from land to sea during the night or
    in winter. That’s when air over the water is warmer than air over
    the land. The warm air rises. Cool air from the land flows out to
    take its place.

**Figure 8.23**

Land and sea breezes blow because of daily differences in heating.

</div>

#### Monsoons {#8.html#x-ck12-TW9uc29vbnM._14-nrb}

**Monsoons** are like land and sea breezes, but on a larger scale. They
occur because of seasonal changes in the temperature of land and water.
In the winter, they blow from land to water. In the summer, they blow
from water to land. In regions that experience monsoons, the seawater
offshore is extremely warm. The hot air absorbs a lot of the moisture
and carries it over the land. Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land.
Monsoons occur in several places around the globe. The most important
monsoon in the world is in southern Asia ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMjItTW9uc29vbnM.) ). These monsoons
are important because they carry water to the many people who live
there.

</div>

#### Mountain and Valley Breezes {#8.html#x-ck12-TW91bnRhaW4gYW5kIFZhbGxleSBCcmVlemVz_14-vw7}

The air on a mountain slope warms more than the air over the nearby
valley. The warm air rises and brings cool air up from below. This is a
**valley breeze** . At night the mountain slope cools more than the air
over the valley. The air flows downhill creating a **mountain breeze** .

#### Katabatic Winds {#8.html#x-ck12-S2F0YWJhdGljIFdpbmRz_14-ctp}

**Katabatic winds** move the same way as mountain and valley breezes.
However, they are much stronger. Katabatic winds form over a high
plateau that is surrounded by mountains. In winter, the plateau grows
cold. Air sinks through the gaps in the mountains. Over Antarctica and
Greenland, these winds are frigid.

#### Chinook Winds {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2hpbm9vayBXaW5kcw.._14-dum}

**Chinook winds** ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE1MDQtMDQ.) ) occur when air is forced
over a mountain range. Warm air rises over the Sierra Nevada in
California, for example, because it is pushed eastward by the westerly
winds. The air cools as it rises and precipitates. The air is now dry.
It sinks down the far side of the mountains and may create strong winds.
These Chinook winds are relatively warm. If there is snow, the winds may
melt it quickly. The dry sinking air creates a **rainshadow effect** .
Rainshadow effect is responsible for many of the world's deserts.

As air rises over a mountain it cools and loses moisture. The air warms
by compression on the leeward side. The resulting warm and dry winds are
Chinook winds. The leeward side of the mountain experiences rainshadow
effect.

</div>

#### Santa Ana Winds {#8.html#x-ck12-U2FudGEgQW5hIFdpbmRz_14-cvu}

**Santa Ana winds** ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE1MDQtMDU.) ) are responsible for many
large fires in Southern California ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DYWxpZm9ybmlhV2lsZGZpcmU.) ). The
Santa Ana winds arrive at the end of California’s long summer drought
season. Air east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains cools in late fall. This
creates a high pressure zone. The air is then forced downhill through
the deserts of the Southwest. It blows westward toward the ocean. The
air is blocked by the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. So it is
funneled rapidly through the mountain passes. If a fire starts, it
spreads quickly. The result is large-scale devastation.

**How did the "trade winds" get their name?**

Not so long ago ships could only sail in the direction the wind was
blowing, more-or-less. For centuries, a trip could be made or broken by
how hard the wind blew. The trade winds were named because they were a
reliable way to get across the ocean. Ships engaged in trade needed
these winds to take or leave goods. The trade winds are one of the
global wind belts.

### Global Winds {#8.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFdpbmRz_15-8fn}

**Global winds** are winds that occur in belts that go all around the
planet ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMjMtR2xvYmFsLXdpbmRz) ). Like local
winds, global winds are caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere.

#### Heating and Global Winds {#8.html#x-ck12-SGVhdGluZyBhbmQgR2xvYmFsIFdpbmRz_15-8ah}

Earth is hottest at the Equator and gets cooler toward the poles. The
differences in heating create huge convection currents in the
troposphere. At the Equator, for example, warm air rises up to the
tropopause. When it can’t rise any higher, it flows north or south.

By the time the moving air reaches 30°N or °S latitude, it has cooled
somewhat. The cool air sinks to the surface. Then it flows over the
surface back to the Equator. Other global winds occur in much the same
way. There are three enormous convection cells north of the Equator and
three south of the Equator.

#### Global Winds and the Coriolis Effect {#8.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFdpbmRz_15IGFuZCB0aGUgQ29yaW9saXMgRWZmZWN0-r2o}

Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface. This causes the
Coriolis effect. Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface due to
Coriolis effect. From which direction do the northern trade winds blow?

Without the Coriolis effect the global winds would blow north to south
or south to north. But the Coriolis effect makes them blow northeast to
southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow
northwest to southeast or the reverse in the Southern Hemisphere.

The wind belts have names. The Trade Winds are nearest the Equator. The
next belt is the westerlies. Finally are the polar easterlies. The names
are the same in both hemispheres.

#### Jet Streams {#8.html#x-ck12-SmV0IFN0cmVhbXM._15-ddx}

**Jet streams** are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere.
They are also the result of unequal heating of the atmosphere. Jet
streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east. The strongest jet
streams are the polar jets. PIctured below is the northern polar jet (

**What is a pollution advisory?**

Urban areas in sunny locations have pollution advisories. This happens
when ozone levels get high. On these days, you should stay indoors or
exercise early or late in the day. Drive less and avoid filling your
tank.

### Air Pollutants {#8.html#x-ck12-QWlyIFBvbGx1dGFudHM._16-h2x}

There are two main types of air pollutants: primary and secondary. Most
air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels. Some come from burning
forests. Some are due to the evaporation of chemicals.

#### Types of Air Pollutants {#8.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQWlyIFBvbGx1dGFudHM._16-n8k}

There are two basic types of pollutants in the air. They are known as
primary pollutants and secondary pollutants.

-   **Primary pollutants** enter the air directly. Some are released by
    natural processes, like ash from volcanoes. Most are released by
    human activities.
    -   Carbon oxides are released when fossil fuels burn.
    -   Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen combine at
        high temperatures. This occurs in hot exhausts from vehicles,
        factories, and power plants.
    -   Sulfur oxides are produced when sulfur and oxygen combine. This
        happens when coal that contains sulfur burns.
    -   Toxic heavy metals include mercury and lead. Mercury comes
        from smokestacks. Both metals have industrial uses.
    -   Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon compounds, such
        as methane. VOCs are released by many human activities. Raising
        livestock, for example, produces a lot of methane.
    -   **Particulates** are solid particles. These particles may be
        ash, dust, or even animal wastes. Many are released when fossil
        fuels burn.

<!-- -->

-   **Secondary pollutants** form from primary pollutants. Many occur as
    part of **photochemical smog** . This type of smog is seen as a
    brown haze in the air. Photochemical smog forms when certain
    pollutants have a chemical reaction in the presence of sunlight.
    Photochemical smog consists mainly of **ozone** (O ~3~ ). Ozone near
    the ground is a pollutant ( **Figure**
    [below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Pem9uZUZvcm1hdGlvbg..) ). This
    ozone is harmful to humans and other living things. However, ozone
    in the stratosphere protects Earth from the Sun's harmful
    ultraviolet radiation.

#### Sources of Air Pollutants {#8.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBBaXIgUG9sbHV0YW50cw.._16-if9}

Most pollutants enter the air when fossil fuels burn. Some are released
when forests burn. Others evaporate into the air.

#### Burning Fossil Fuels {#8.html#x-ck12-QnVybmluZyBGb3NzaWwgRnVlbHM._16-u58}

Burning fossil fuels releases many pollutants into the air. These
pollutants include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide,
and sulfur dioxide.

-   Motor vehicles account for almost half of fossil fuel use.
-   Power plants and factories account for more than a quarter of fossil
    fuel use ( **Figure**
    [below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TbW9rZXN0YWNrcw..) ).
-   Homes and other buildings burn fossil fuels.

#### Burning Forests {#8.html#x-ck12-QnVybmluZyBGb3Jlc3Rz_16-snu}

Millions of acres of forest have been cut and burned to make way for
farming ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMDUtc2xhc2gtYW5kLWJ1cm4tYWdyaQ..) ).
Burning trees produces most of the same pollutants as burning fossil
fuels.

#### Evaporation of VOCs {#8.html#x-ck12-RXZhcG9yYXRpb24gb2YgVk9Dcw.._16-mco}

VOCs enter the air by evaporation. VOCs are found in many products, like
paints and petroleum products. Methane is a VOC that evaporates from
livestock waste and landfills.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-m0m}

-   There are many types of primary pollutants, including carbon oxides,
    nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulates, lead, and volatile
    organic compounds.
-   Secondary pollutants form from chemical reactions that occur when
    pollution is exposed to sunlight.
-   Most pollutants enter the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning.
    Burning forests and evaporation of some chemicals account for most
    of the rest.

**Why do we treat the atmosphere like a dump?**

On a smoggy day, you're breathing garbage. Many human activities dump
trash into the air. The trash is gases and particles, but it's still
trash. Would we tolerate all this trash if it were in our houses?

### Effects of Pollutants {#8.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBQb2xsdXRhbnRz_17-lgs}

Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About
22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted
air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and
lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from
other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air
pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing.
Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air
pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living
things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can
also harm the environment.

#### Types of Pollutants {#8.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUG9sbHV0YW50cw.._17-my9}

This concept explores the effects of different pollutants on the
environment and human health. The pollutants include particulates,
ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, heavy metals,
and VOCs.

#### Particulates {#8.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljdWxhdGVz_17-icq}

Particulates cause lung diseases. They can also increase the risk of
heart disease and the number of asthma attacks. Particulates block
sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface. This means there is less energy
for photosynthesis. Less photosynthesis means that plants and
phytoplankton produce less food. This affects whole ecosystems.

#### Ozone {#8.html#x-ck12-T3pvbmU._17-aps}

The ozone in smog may damage plants. The effects of ozone add up over
time. Plants such as trees, which normally live a long time, are most
affected. Entire forests may die out if ozone levels are very high.
Other plants, including crop plants, may also be damaged by ozone.
Below, you can see evidence of ozone damage ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMDYtb3pvbmUtZGFtYWdl) ).

the levels of ozone to watch out for ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMDctb3pvbmUtaW5kZXg.) ). Some people
are especially sensitive to ozone. They can be harmed by levels of ozone
that would not affect most other people. These people include those with
lung or heart problems.

of air. How many parts of ozone are unhealthy for everyone?

</div>

#### Nitrogen and Sulfur Oxides {#8.html#x-ck12-Tml0cm9nZW4gYW5kIFN1bGZ1ciBPeGlkZXM._17-hra}

Both nitrogen and sulfur oxides are toxic to humans. These compounds can
cause lung diseases or make them worse. Nitrogen and sulfur oxides form
acid rain, which is described in the next concept.

#### Carbon Monoxide {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uIE1vbm94aWRl_17-fk7}

Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic to both plants and animals. CO is deadly
to people in a confined space, such as a closed home. Carbon monoxide is
odorless and colorless, so people can’t tell when they are breathing it.
That’s why homes should have carbon monoxide detectors.

#### Heavy Metals {#8.html#x-ck12-SGVhdnkgTWV0YWxz_17-ya9}

Heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, are toxic to living things. They
can enter food chains from the atmosphere. The metals build up in the
tissues of organisms by **bioaccumulation** ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMDktYmlvYWNjdW11bGF0aW9uLW1lcmN1cnk.)
). Heavy metals accumulate as they are passed up a food chain. Imagine a
low-level consumer eating a producer. That consumer takes in all of the
heavy metals from all of the producers that it eats. Then a higher-level
consumer eats the low-level consumer. The higher-level consumer
accumulates all of the heavy metals from all of the lower-level
consumers that it eats. In this way, an organism accumulates a lot of
heavy metals. At high levels in the food chain, the heavy metals may
become quite concentrated.

This diagram shows how mercury bioaccumulates. Compare the parts per
million (ppm) of mercury in phytoplankton and gull eggs. Can you explain
the difference?

</div>

The higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of
toxic metals they take in. That’s why people should avoid eating too
much large fish, such as tuna. Tuna are predators near the top of their
food chains. They have been shown to contain high levels of mercury. In
people, heavy metals can damage the brain and other organs. Unborn
babies and young children are most affected. That’s because their organs
are still developing.

#### VOCs {#8.html#x-ck12-Vk9Dcw.._17-7lk}

VOCs are toxic to humans and other living things. In people, they can
cause a wide range of problems. These can range from eye and nose
irritation to brain damage and cancer. Levels of VOCs are often higher
indoors than out. That’s because they are released by products such as
paints, cleaning solutions, and building materials. How might you reduce
your exposure to VOCs?

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-6i5}

-   An increase in particulates may have these effects. It may reduce
    photosynthesis, increase precipitation, and reduce temperatures.
-   Ozone may damage native plants and some crop plants. Ozone may slow
    plant growth or damage leaves.
-   Pollutants emitted into the air cause lung and other diseases
    in humans.

**What would the artists think?**

Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris opened in 1345. Construction took almost
200 years. For about 500 years, the cathedral was pristine. Yet this
gargoyle has pits in it. The pits are caused by acid rain. Acid rain
forms from pollutants from fossil fuel burning.

### Acid Rain {#8.html#x-ck12-QWNpZCBSYWlu_18-hmn}

**Acid rain** is rain that has a pH less than 5 ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMTAtcEgtc2NhbGU.) ). Acidity is
measured on the **pH scale** . Lower numbers are more acidic, and higher
numbers are less acidic (also called more **alkaline** ). An **acid**
has a pH of less than 7. The pH of normal rain is 5.6. It’s slightly
acidic because carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in rain. This forms
carbonic acid, a weak acid.

have problems reproducing?

</div>

#### How Acid Rain Forms {#8.html#x-ck12-SG93IEFjaWQgUmFpbiBGb3Jtcw.._18-a5h}

Acid rain forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air dissolve in rain
( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMTEtYWNpZC1yYWluLWZvcm1hdGlvbg..) ).
This forms nitric and sulfuric acids. Both are strong acids. Acid rain
with a pH as low as 4.0 is now common in many areas. Acid fog may be
even more acidic than acid rain. Fog with a pH as low as 1.7 has been
recorded. That’s the same pH as toilet bowl cleaner!

The image below shows some of the damage done by acid rain ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMTItYWNpZC1yYWluLWRhbWFnZQ..) ). Acid
rain ends up in soil and bodies of water. This can make them very
acidic. The acid strips soil of its nutrients. These changes can kill
trees, fish, and other living things. Acid rain also dissolves limestone
and marble. This can damage buildings, monuments, and statues.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-k8x}

-   Nitrogen and sulfur compounds emitted high into the atmosphere
    create acids. These acids may fall as acid rain.
-   Acidity is measured on a pH scale. Rain that is 5.0 or less on that
    scale is considered acid rain.
-   Acid rain weakens plants and animals and damages cultural treasures.

**Why can't the children in Punta Arenas go outside to play in the
spring?**

Punta Arenas, Chile is the world's most southern city. At such a high
latitude, winters are exceedingly cold and dark. Unlike the children
pictured above, the children in Punta Arenas must stay inside to avoid
the cold. Of course, they look forward to spring when they can go out to
play. But some years, it is too dangerous for the children to go
outside. The ozone hole has moved north. Too much of the Sun's harmful
UV radiation gets through.

### Loss of High-Level Ozone {#8.html#x-ck12-TG9zcyBvZiBIaWdoLUxldmVsIE96b25l_19-81w}

Ozone near the ground harms human health. Ground-level ozone is a
pollutant. But the ozone layer in the stratosphere protects us from
harmful solar rays. That’s why people were alarmed in the 1980s to learn
that there was a hole in the ozone layer.

#### Cause of Ozone Loss {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2Ugb2YgT3pvbmUgTG9zcw.._19-yr5}

What’s destroying the ozone layer? The chief cause is
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These are human-made chemicals that contain
the element chlorine (Cl). In the past, CFCs were widely used in spray
cans, refrigerators, and many other products. CFCs are stable compounds
that can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Once CFCs are in the air, they float up into the stratosphere. What
happens next is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjItMTMtQ0ZDLW96b25lLWJyZWFrZG93bg..) ).
Sunlight breaks apart the molecules. This releases their chlorine ions
(Cl). The free chlorine ions may then combine with oxygen ions in ozone.
This breaks down the ozone molecules into an oxygen molecule and an
oxygen ion. One CFC molecule can break down as many as 100,000 ozone
molecules in this way! These forms of oxygen do not protect the planet
from ultraviolet radiation.

#### Ozone Hole {#8.html#x-ck12-T3pvbmUgSG9sZQ.._19-3ex}

Most ozone loss it taking place over the South Pole and Antarctica. This
is the location of the ozone hole. The **ozone hole** is a region in the
stratosphere where there is less ozone than normal. Conditions are just
right for ozone destruction because it is exceedingly cold. The ozone
hole is also seasonal. The hole forms during the early part spring in
the Southern Hemisphere and then grows northward ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTUtMTUtSG9sZS1pbi1vem9uZS1sYXllcg..) ).
The ozone layer is also thinner over the Northern Hemisphere.

The hole in the ozone layer occurs over Antarctica. How do you think the
hole in the ozone layer could affect life on Earth?

</div>

#### Effects of Ozone Loss {#8.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBPem9uZSBMb3Nz_19-zm3}

With less ozone in the stratosphere, more UV rays reach the ground. More
UV rays increase skin cancer rates. Just a 1 percent loss of ozone
causes a 5 percent increase in skin cancer. More UV rays also harm
plants and phytoplankton. As a result, they produce less food. This may
affect entire ecosystems.

#### Protecting the Ozone Layer {#8.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVjdGluZyB0aGUgT3pvbmUgTGF5ZXI._19-spr}

The Montreal Protocol is a worldwide agreement on air pollution. It
focuses on CFCs. It was signed by many countries in 1987. It controls
almost 100 chemicals that can damage the ozone layer. Its aim is to
return the ozone layer to its normal state.

The Montreal Protocol has been effective in controlling CFCs. By 1995,
few CFCs were still being used. But the ozone hole kept growing for
several years after that because of the CFCs already in the atmosphere.
It peaked in 2006. Since then, it has been somewhat smaller. The
Montreal Protocol is a shining example of how nations can come together
to solve a global environmental problem.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-hwz}

-   CFCs float up into the stratosphere where they break apart. The
    chlorine pulls an oxygen ion off of an ozone molecule and
    destroys it.
-   The ozone hole forms over Antarctica in the spring.
-   Ozone loss increases the amount of high-energy ultraviolet radiation
    that strikes Earth. This can cause ecological and health problems.

**Can a car run on hydrogen?**

Yes! But so far this is not feasible for more than just a few models. A
major problem with hydrogen cars is the lack of hydrogen fuel. Many ways
to reduce pollution are being developed. What can you do to help?

### The Clean Air Act {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENsZWFuIEFpciBBY3Q._20-1gf}

**Air quality** is a measure of the pollutants in the air. More
pollutants mean poorer air quality. Poor air quality started to become a
serious problem after the Industrial Revolution. Factories burned coal
for energy. Gasoline burned by cars and trucks added greatly to air
pollution. By the mid-1900s, air quality in many big cities was very
bad. Incidents in London and in U.S. cities alerted people to the extent
of the problem. It was clear that air quality needed to be protected.

In 1970 in the U.S., the Clean Air Act was passed. It limits what can be
released into the air. The air in the U.S. is much cleaner now than it
was 50 years ago. But air pollution has not gone away. Vehicles,
factories, and power plants still release more than 150 million tons of
pollutants into the air each year.

### Reducing Pollutants from Fossil Fuels {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVkdWNpbmcgUG9sbHV0YW50cyBmcm9tIEZvc3NpbCBGdWVscw.._20-hfb}

There are two basic types of strategies for reducing pollution from
fossil fuels:

1.  Use less fossil fuel.
2.  Prevent pollutants from entering the air.

#### Use Less Fossil Fuel {#8.html#x-ck12-VXNlIExlc3MgRm9zc2lsIEZ1ZWw._20-508}

We can reduce our use of fossil fuels in several ways:

-   Conserve fossil fuels. For example, turning out lights when we
    aren’t using them saves electricity. Why does this help? A lot of
    the electricity we use comes from coal-burning power plants.
-   Use fossil fuels more efficiently. For example, driving a
    fuel-efficient car lets you go farther on each gallon of gas. This
    can add up to a big savings in fossil fuel use.
-   Keep up with technology. Hybrid cars run on electricity that would
    be wasted during braking. These cars use gas only as a backup fuel.
    As a result, they produce just 10 percent of the air pollution
    produced by regular cars.

#### Keeping Pollutants out of the Air {#8.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBQb2xsdXRhbnRzIG91dCBvZiB0aGUgQWly_20-lnx}

Some of the pollutants from fossil fuels can be filtered out of exhaust
before it is released into the air ( **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FeGhhdXN0Q29tcG9zaXRl) ). Other
pollutants can be changed to harmless compounds before they are
released. Two widely used technologies are scrubbers and catalytic
converters.

-   Scrubbers are used in factories and power plants. They remove
    particulates and waste gases from exhaust before it is released to
    the air.
-   Catalytic converters are used on motor vehicles. They break down
    pollutants in exhaust to non-toxic compounds. For example, they
    change nitrogen oxides to harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases.

#### Increasing Alternative Energy Sources {#8.html#x-ck12-SW5jcmVhc2luZyBBbHRlcm5hdGl2ZSBFbmVyZ3kgU291cmNlcw.._20-b39}

Developing alternative energy sources is important. What are some of the
problems facing wider adoption of alternative energy sources?

-   The technologies are still being developed. This includes sources of
    alternative energy, like solar and wind.
-   Solar and wind are still expensive relative to fossil fuels. The
    technology needs to advance so that the price falls.
-   Some areas get low amounts of sunlight and are not suited for solar.
    Others do not have much wind. It is important that regions develop
    what best suits them. The desert Southwest will need to
    develop solar. The Great Plains can use wind energy. Perhaps some
    locations will rely on nuclear power.

#### Ways You Can Reduce Air Pollution {#8.html#x-ck12-V2F5cyBZb3UgQ2FuIFJlZHVjZSBBaXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_20-rp0}

Everyone can help to reduce air pollution. Just use less fossil fuels!
How can you do this?

-   Ride a bike or walk instead of driving.
-   Take a bus or carpool.
-   Buy a fuel efficient car.
-   Turn off lights and appliances when they are not in use.
-   Use energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.
-   Buy fewer things that are manufactured using fossil fuels.

All these actions reduce the amount of energy that power plants need to
produce.

## Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-aps}

The layers of the atmosphere are divided by their temperature gradients.
The lowest layer is the troposphere. All weather takes place in this
layer. The next layer is the stratosphere. The stratosphere contains the
protective ozone layer. More sunlight strikes at the Equator than at the
poles. This is what drives the global winds. Warm air rises, moves
poleward, and then sinks when it meets with air moving toward the
Equator. The result is six atmospheric circulation cells around the
world. There are three cells in each hemisphere. Pollutants enter the
atmosphere from a few sources. The most important is fossil fuel
burning. Air pollution has bad effects on the environment and on human
health. By reducing fossil fuel use we can make the environment cleaner.
When ozone depletion was found to be a problem, the world acted. As a
result, the ozone hole has stabilized. The hole will be getting smaller
over the next decades.

**What's the difference between weather and climate?**

When you think of Greece, you probably think of sunshine and white
buildings. Maybe a beautiful beach. All of these are typical of Greece,
which has a warm Mediterranean climate. In the winter, snow sometimes
blankets the highlands. Rarely, though, it snows in the Greek lowlands.
Snow is so uncommon in Athens that when it happens it brings the city to
a standstill. The Acropolis sits on a rocky outcrop above Athens. It's
beautiful, but rare, to see this ancient ruin covered with snow. The
weather in the photo on the right is cold and snowy, but the climate is
still Mediterranean. Climate is the long-term average of weather.

**What's the weather like?**

The United States is a big country. With two coasts and a large land
mass in between, there's a chance for every kind of weather. In the next
few sections we'll visit places that have the type of weather we're
interested in studying.

### What is Weather? {#9.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBXZWF0aGVyPw..-dty}

All **weather** takes place in the atmosphere. Nearly all of it in the
lower atmosphere. **Weather** refers to the conditions of the atmosphere
at a given time and place. **Climate** is the average of weather over a
long time.

Imagine your grandmother who lives in a distant place calls you up. She
asks what your weather is like today. What would you say? Is it warm or
cold? Sunny or cloudy? Calm or windy? Clear or rainy? What features of
weather are important to mention?

A location’s weather depends on:

-   air temperature.
-   air pressure.
-   fog.
-   humidity.
-   cloud cover.
-   precipitation.
-   wind speed and direction.

All of these characteristics are directly related to the amount of
energy that is in the system, and where that energy is. The ultimate
source of this energy is the Sun.

Weather is what we experience from day to day, or minute to minute.
Weather can change rapidly.

### What Causes Weather? {#9.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBDYXVzZXMgV2VhdGhlcj8.-6l0}

Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source
of heat is the Sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated
simply:

-   The Sun heats Earth’s surface more in some places than in others.
-   Where it is warm, heat from the Sun warms the air close to
    the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of
    the water to evaporate.
-   Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense
    air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind.
-   The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is
    moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and
    precipitation may fall.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-zdl}

-   A region's weather depends on its air temperature, air pressure,
    humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and
    other factors.
-   Climate is the long-term average of weather.
-   Weather can change in minutes, but climate changes very slowly.

**Would you rather spend a summer day in Phoenix or in Houston?**

People who live in Phoenix, Arizona are told that summer isn't so bad
because "it's a dry heat." What does that mean? Imagine that both
Phoenix and Houston have a temperature of 90°F. In Phoenix, the relative
humidity is 20%. In Houston, the relative humidity is 90%. So in Phoenix
it feels like it's 90°. But in Houston it feels like it's 122! Of course
in Phoenix in July, the average high temperature is 106°. That's hot,
dry or not!

### Humidity {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVtaWRpdHk._1-6qv}

**Humidity** is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity
increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.

#### Relative Humidity {#9.html#x-ck12-UmVsYXRpdmUgSHVtaWRpdHk._1-b6l}

Humidity usually refers to **relative humidity** . This is the percent
of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold.
How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm
air can hold more water vapor than cool air ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SZWxhdGl2ZUh1bWlkaXR5) ).

#### Humidity and Heat {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVtaWRpdHkgYW5kIEhlYXQ._1-90w}

People often say, “it’s not the heat but the humidity.” Humidity can
make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat evaporates, it cools your
body. But sweat can’t evaporate when the air already contains as much
water vapor as it can hold. The **heat index** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMDItSGVhdC1pbmRleA..) ) is a measure
of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity.

#### Dew Point {#9.html#x-ck12-RGV3IFBvaW50_1-kzw}

You’ve probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does
dew form? Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily.
So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the
daytime also cools over night. As the air cools, it can hold less water
vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as
blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is
called the **dew point** . If this temperature is below freezing, ice
crystals of frost form instead of dew ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmFzc1dpdGhEZXdGcm9zdENvbXBvc2l0ZQ..)
). The dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you
explain why?

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-uqg}

-   Air reaches its dew point when humidity increases or
    temperature decreases.
-   Water droplets form when the air reaches 100% humidity. If the
    temperature is cold enough, frost will form.
-   Relative humidity is how the air feels at its temperature
    and humidity.

**Where should you go if you don't want to see the Sun?**

The Pacific Northwest has the most days of heavy cloud cover. 62% of
days have more than three-quarters of the sky covered in clouds in
Seattle. Conditions are nearly the same in Portland, Oregon. If you want
to see the most sunshine, the least cloudy cities are in Arizona.

### Clouds {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xvdWRz_2-75y}

**Clouds** form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds
may form anywhere in the troposphere. Clouds that form on the ground are
called **fog** .

#### How Clouds Form {#9.html#x-ck12-SG93IENsb3VkcyBGb3Jt_2-ew8}

Clouds form when water vapor condenses around particles in the air. The
particles are specks of matter, such as dust or smoke. Billions of these
tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud. If the air is very
cold, ice crystals form instead of liquid water.

#### Classification of Clouds {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQ2xvdWRz_2-609}

Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three
main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus; there are other
types of clouds, as well ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DbG91ZFR5cGVz) ).

-   **Cirrus clouds** form high in the troposphere. Because it is so
    cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus
    clouds don’t usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign
    that wet weather is coming.
-   **Stratus clouds** occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers
    that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a
    thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are
    called nimbostratus. The prefix *nimbo-* means “rain.”
-   **Cumulus clouds** are white and puffy. Convection currents make
    them grow upward, and they may grow very tall. When they produce
    rain, they are called cumulonimbus.

**Figure 9.4**

Find the cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus clouds in the figure.
What do they have in common? They all form high in the troposphere.
Clouds that form in the mid troposphere have the prefix “alto-”, as in
altocumulus. Where do stratocumulus clouds form?

</div>

#### Clouds and Temperature {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xvdWRz_2IGFuZCBUZW1wZXJhdHVyZQ..-ku7}

Clouds can affect the temperature on Earth’s surface. During the day,
thick clouds block some of the Sun’s rays. This keeps the surface from
heating up as much as it would on a clear day. At night, thick clouds
prevent heat from radiating out into space. This keeps the surface
warmer than it would be on a clear night.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-0un}

-   Water vapor condenses on particles in the air to form clouds.
-   Clouds block sunlight in the day. Clouds trap heat in the atmosphere
    at night.
-   Cloud types include cirrus, stratus, and cumulus.

**Where is the most famous fog in the U.S.?**

San Francisco, the city by the bay, is known for its fog. There's an old
joke: "I spent the coldest winter of my life in San Francisco one
summer." That's because of the fog! There is a big difference in
temperature between the two sides of the city. On the Pacific side,
where there is fog, temperatures are low. On the bay side, where there
isn't fog, temperatures are much higher.

### Fog {#9.html#x-ck12-Rm9n_3-tsz}

**Fog** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Gb2dDb21wb3NpdGU.) ) is a cloud on the
ground. Fog forms when humid air near the ground cools below its dew
point. Each type of fog forms in a different way.

-   **Radiation fog** forms at night. Skies are clear, and the relative
    humidity is high. The ground cools as temperature goes down. Air
    near the ground cools below its dew point. Tule fog is an extreme
    form of radiation fog. This type of fog strikes the Central Valley
    of California in winter.
-   **Advection fog** is famous in San Francisco, California. Warm,
    moist air comes in from the Pacific Ocean. The air blows over the
    cold California current. When the air cools below its dew point,
    fog forms. Sea breezes bring the fog onshore.
-   **Steam fog** appears in autumn when cool air moves over a
    warm lake. Water evaporates from the lake surface. As the water
    vapor cools, it condenses. The fog appears like steam.
-   Warm humid air travels up a hillside and cools below its dew point
    to create **upslope fog** .

**Want to stay dry? Don't go to these places!**

The wettest locations in the world are in Mawsynram and Cherrapunji in
India. Monsoon rains result in more than 460" of rain annually. The
wettest place in the United States with 404" on average is on Maui (Big
Bog). The wettest place in the continental United States is Langlois,
Oregon with a mere 122" per year.

### Precipitation {#9.html#x-ck12-UHJlY2lwaXRhdGlvbg.._4-ehw}

Clouds are needed for precipitation. **Precipitation** is water that
falls from the sky. This may fall as liquid water, mostly as **rain** .
It may fall also as frozen water, such as snow.

#### Why Precipitation Falls {#9.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFByZWNpcGl0YXRpb24gRmFsbHM._4-sbe}

Millions of water molecules in a cloud must condense to make a single
raindrop or snowflake. The drop or flake falls when it becomes too heavy
for updrafts to keep it aloft. As a drop or flake falls, it may collect
more water and get larger.

#### Types of Precipitation {#9.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUHJlY2lwaXRhdGlvbg.._4-mpv}

Why does it snow instead of rain? Air temperature determines which type
of precipitation falls. Rain falls if the air temperature is above
freezing (0° C or 32° F). Frozen precipitation falls if the air or
ground is below freezing. Frozen precipitation may fall as **snow** ,
**sleet** , or **freezing rain** . Below, you can see how the different
types form ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMDQtRnJvemVuLXByZWNpcGl0YXRpb25z) ).

-   Precipitation falls when it gets too heavy to stay in a cloud.
-   Rain droplets caught up in air currents within a cloud get larger by
    the addition of condensed droplets until they are too heavy and
    they fall.
-   If the ground is very cold, rain can freeze to become sleet
    or glaze.

**Pick an air mass!**

A cold dry air mass forms over the interior of Alaska. The mountain is
Mt. McKinley in Denali National Park. A warm wet air mass forms over the
ocean. It sneaks onto the coastal area. Which region would you like to
visit?

### Air Masses {#9.html#x-ck12-QWlyIE1hc3Nlcw.._5-dyo}

An **air mass** is a large body of air that has about the same
conditions throughout. For example, an air mass might have cold dry air.
Another air mass might have warm moist air. The characteristics of an
air mass depend on where the air mass formed. The air must stay over
that location long enough to pick up those characteristics.

#### Formation of Air Masses {#9.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIEFpciBNYXNzZXM._5-f75}

Most air masses form over polar or tropical regions. They may form over
continents or oceans. Air masses are moist if they form over oceans.
They are dry if they form over continents. Air masses that form over
oceans are called maritime air masses. Those that form over continents
are called continental air masses. The image below shows air masses that
form over or near North America ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMDYtTm9ydGhhbWVyaWNhbi1haXItbWFzc2Vz)
).

An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms. For
example, a continental polar air mass has cold dry air. A maritime polar
air mass has cold moist air. Which air masses have warm moist air? Where
do they form?

#### Movement of Air Masses {#9.html#x-ck12-TW92ZW1lbnQgb2YgQWlyIE1hc3Nlcw.._5-n74}

When a new air mass moves over a region it brings its characteristics to
the region. This may change the area's temperature and humidity. Moving
air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different
conditions. For example, a warm air mass moving over cold ground may
cause an inversion.

Why do air masses move? Winds and jet streams push them along. Cold air
masses tend to move toward the Equator. Warm air masses tend to move
toward the poles. The Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal.
Many air masses move toward the northeast over the U.S. This is the same
direction that global winds blow.

Figures and animations explain weather basics at this USA Today site:
[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wstorm0.htm](wstorm0.htm) .

An online guide from the University of Illinois about air masses and
fronts is found here:
[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/af/home.rxml](home.rxml)
.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-uep}

-   An air mass has roughly the same temperature and humidity.
-   Air masses form over regions where the air is stable for a long
    enough time. The air takes on the characteristics of the region.
-   Air masses move when they are pushed by high level winds.

**What happens when one air mass meets another?**

This sight is common when one air mass meets another. You can almost see
one air mass being pushed up over the other. When two air masses meet,
the result is often a storm. Have you been to the Midwestern United
States in the spring? This is a common sight.

### Fronts {#9.html#x-ck12-RnJvbnRz_6-n84}

When cold air masses move south from the poles, they run into warm air
masses moving north from the tropics. The boundary between two air
masses is called a **front** . Air masses usually don’t mix at a front.
The differences in temperature and pressure cause clouds and
precipitation. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and
stationary fronts.

### Cold Fronts {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29sZCBGcm9udHM._6-vxg}

A **cold front** forms when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMDctQ29sZC1mcm9udA..) ).
The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass. So the cold air
mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its
water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm
air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. Temperature and pressure
differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very
strong along a cold front.

**Figure 9.8**

Cold fronts often bring stormy weather.

</div>

As the fast-moving cold air mass keeps advancing, so does the cold
front. Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in the weather. There may
be a thin line of storms right at the front that moves as it moves. In
the spring and summer, the storms may be thunderstorms and tornadoes. In
the late fall and winter, the storms may bring snow. After a cold front
passes, the cold air mass behind it brings cooler temperatures. The air
is likely to be less humid as well. Can you explain why?

#### Warm Fronts {#9.html#x-ck12-V2FybSBGcm9udHM._6-dsb}

When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass, it creates a **warm
front** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMDgtV2FybS1mcm9udA..) ). The warm air
mass is moving faster than the cold air mass. The warm air mass then
flows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools. This
brings about clouds and sometimes light precipitation. Warm fronts move
slowly and cover a wide area. After a warm front passes, the warm air
mass behind it brings warmer temperatures. The warm air is also likely
to be more humid.

Warm fronts generally bring cloudy weather.

</div>

#### Occluded Fronts {#9.html#x-ck12-T2NjbHVkZWQgRnJvbnRz_6-ior}

With an **occluded front** , a warm air mass becomes trapped between two
cold air masses. The warm air is lifted up above the cold air (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMDktT2NjbHVkZWQtZnJvbnQ.)
). Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical.

</div>

#### Stationary Fronts {#9.html#x-ck12-U3RhdGlvbmFyeSBGcm9udHM._6-bdp}

Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet. These stalled air
masses create a **stationary front** . Such a front may bring clouds and
precipitation to the same area for many days.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-qni}

-   Much of the weather occurs at fronts, where air masses meet.
-   In a warm front, a warm air mass slides over a cold air mass. In a
    cold front, a cold air mass slides under a warm air mass.
-   An occluded front has three air masses: cold, warm, and cold.

**How do you get struck by lightning?**

An average of 55 people die from lightning strikes each year in the
United States. Here's your best chance for being struck by lightning,
according to NASA. Go golfing on a July Sunday at around 4 pm,
especially in Florida. The golf club up in the air acts as a lightning
rod. The late afternoon in July is a great time for thunderstorms.
Florida is prone to thunderstorms, and Sunday is a day on which a lot of
people like to golf. In other words, don't do these things!

### Thunderstorms {#9.html#x-ck12-VGh1bmRlcnN0b3Jtcw.._7-4gk}

**Thunderstorms** are are known for their heavy rains and lightning. In
strong thunderstorms, hail and high winds are also likely. Thunderstorms
are very common. Worldwide, there are about 14 million of them each
year! In the U.S., they are most common—and strongest—in the Midwest.

#### Thunderstorm Formation {#9.html#x-ck12-VGh1bmRlcnN0b3JtIEZvcm1hdGlvbg.._7-ayw}

Thunderstorms form when the ground is really hot ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UaHVuZGVyc3Rvcm1Gb3JtYXRpb24.) ). The
air near the ground becomes very warm and humid. This is true in some
locations in late afternoon or early evening in spring and summer. The
warm air rises rapidly, which creates strong updrafts. When the rising
air cools, its water vapor condenses. The updrafts create tall
cumulonimbus clouds. Winds blow the cloud top sideways. This makes the
well-known anvil shape of a cloud known as a thunderhead ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMTItVGh1bmRlcmhlYWQ.) ). Water
droplets and ice fly up through the cloud. When these droplets get heavy
enough, they fall. This starts a downdraft. A convection cell develops
within the cloud. A mature thunderstorm produces gusty winds, lightning,
heavy rain, and hail.

#### Lightning and Thunder {#9.html#x-ck12-TGlnaHRuaW5nIGFuZCBUaHVuZGVy_7-ezx}

During a thunderstorm, some parts of a thunderhead become negatively
charged. Other parts become positively charged. The difference in charge
creates lightning. **Lightning** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMTMtTGlnaHRuaW5nLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50) )
is a huge release of electricity. Lightning can jump between oppositely
charged parts of the same cloud, between one cloud and another, or
between a cloud and the ground. Lightning blasts the air with energy.
The air heats and expands so quickly that it explodes. This creates the
loud sound of **thunder** .

Do you know why you always hear the boom of thunder after you see the
flash of lightning? It’s because light travels faster than sound. If you
count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder, you can
estimate how far away the lightning was. A lapse of five seconds is
equal to about a mile.

</div>

#### The End {#9.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVuZA.._7-qbr}

The downdrafts cool the air at the base of the cloud. The air is no
longer warm enough to rise. Convection shuts down and the thunderhead
runs out of energy. A thunderstorm usually ends only 15 to 30 minutes
after it begins. New thunderstorms may start in the same area.

Many thunderstorms form individually. During some seasons, they form in
**squall lines** , long lines of thunderstorms, along a cold front.
Squall lines form in spring and early summer in the Midwestern United
States. This is because the maritime tropical (mT) air mass from the
Gulf of Mexico meets the continental polar (cP) air mass from Canada (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TcXVhbGxMaW5l) ).

-   Thunderstorms grow where ground temperatures are extremely high.
-   Convection in the cloud causes raindrops or hailstones to grow.
    Downdrafts ultimately end convection.

**Where do you go to see a tornado? Tornado Alley!**

Tornadoes are deadly serious. The deadliest in recent years killed 158
people in Joplin, Missouri in 2011. More than 550 people died in the
United States from tornadoes that year. The deadliest tornado on record
killed 629 people in 1926. This "tri-state" tornado raced across
Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.

### Tornadoes {#9.html#x-ck12-VG9ybmFkb2Vz_8-fdg}

Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds. This allows
them to produce tornadoes. A **tornado** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaWR3ZXN0VG9ybmFkbw..) ) is a
funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds. The funnel moves along the
ground, destroying everything in its path. As it moves, it loses energy.
Before this happens, it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles).
Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow. They may be only 150 meters (500
feet) wide. Tornadoes are also called twisters.

#### Classifying Tornadoes {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZnlpbmcgVG9ybmFkb2Vz_8-exu}

The winds of a tornado can reach very high speeds. The faster the winds
blow, the greater the damage they cause. Wind speed and damage are used
to classify tornadoes ( **Table**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6RnVqaXRhU2NhbGU.) ).

  **F-Scale Rating**   **Wind Speed (kilometers per hour)**   **Wind Speed (miles per hour)**   **Damage**
  -------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  F0                   64-116                                 40-72                             Light - tree branches fall and chimneys may collapse
  F1                   117-180                                73-112                            Moderate - mobile homes, autos pushed aside
  F2                   181-253                                113-157                           Considerable - roofs torn off houses, large trees uprooted
  F3                   254-332                                158-206                           Severe - houses torn apart, trees uprooted, cars lifted
  F4                   333-419                                207-260                           Devastating - houses leveled, cars thrown
  F5                   420-512                                261-318                           Incredible - structures fly, cars become missiles

#### Tornado Alley {#9.html#x-ck12-VG9ybmFkbyBBbGxleQ.._8-39n}

Look at the map below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ub3JuYWRvQWxsZXk.) ). It shows where
the greatest number of tornadoes occur in the U.S. Tornadoes can happen
almost anywhere in the U.S., but only this area is called “Tornado
Alley.” Why do so many tornadoes occur here? This is where warm air
masses from the south run into cold air masses from the north.

#### Damage {#9.html#x-ck12-RGFtYWdl_8-wmo}

A tornado only strikes a small area. But it can destroy everything in
its path. Most injuries and deaths from tornadoes are caused by flying
debris ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NdXJmcmVlc2Jvcm9Ub3JuYWRvRGFtYWdl) ).
In the United States, an average of 90 people are killed by tornadoes
each year. The most violent two percent of tornadoes account for 70% of
the deaths by tornadoes.

Late April 2011 saw the deadliest set of tornadoes in more than 25
years. There were more than 150 tornadoes reported throughout the day!
Severe thunderstorms came about when two very different air masses met.
A warm moist air mass blew north from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of
Mexico (mT). It rammed into a cold polar air mass (cP) that the was
sitting over the region. In addition, the jet stream was blowing
strongly in from the west ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTYtMjcuNS1Ub3JuYWRvLVNhdGVsbGl0ZQ..) ).

Everyone in the region was told that tornadoes were possible. But it's
impossible to know exactly where and when a tornado will touch down. The
path it will take is unknown, because tornado movement is not very
predictable.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-aq8}

-   A tornado is a whirling funnel of air extending down from a
    cumulonimbus cloud.
-   The Fujita scale measures tornado intensity based on wind speed
    and damage.
-   Tornadoes can only be predicted over a wide region.

**Did you go out on Halloween in 2011?**

If you did, you probably don't live in the northeastern United States.
In much of the region, Halloween was postponed in 2011. A large and
early nor'easter struck the area. The massive storm dropped as much as
32 inches of snow. It caused over three million people to lose power. In
all, 39 people died.

### Mid-Latitude Cyclones {#9.html#x-ck12-TWlkLUxhdGl0dWRlIEN5Y2xvbmVz_9-vcq}

Cyclones can be the most intense storms on Earth. A **cyclone** is a
system of winds that rotate around a low pressure center. The swirling
air rises and cools. This creates clouds and precipitation.

**Mid-latitude cyclones** form at the polar front. Two very different
air masses blow past each other in opposite directions. The Coriolis
effect causes winds to strike the polar front at an angle. Warm and cold
fronts form next to each other.

Most winter storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United
States and Europe, are caused by mid-latitude cyclones ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE2MDMtMTA.) ).

**Figure 9.19**

A hypothetical mid-latitude cyclone affecting the United Kingdom. The
arrows point the wind direction and its relative temperature; L is the
low pressure area. Notice the warm, cold, and occluded fronts.

</div>

The warm air at the cold front rises and creates a low pressure cell.
Winds rush into the low pressure. This creates a rising column of air.
The air twists, rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and
clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the rising air is moist,
rain or snow falls.

Mid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the mid-latitudes. The storms
move eastward with the westerly winds. These two- to five-day storms can
reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles) in diameter. They can
produce winds up to 125 km (75 miles) per hour.

#### Nor'easters {#9.html#x-ck12-Tm9yJ2Vhc3RlcnM._9-32d}

Mid-latitude cyclones are especially fierce in the mid-Atlantic and New
England states. They are called **nor’easters** because they come from
the northeast. About 30 nor’easters strike the region each year (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE2MDMtMTE.) ).

**Ever been to The Big Easy?**

New Orleans, Louisiana is a city unlike any other. The city is known for
it's Cajun food, jazz music, and full out celebration of Mardi Gras.
Residents love the city with a great intensity. Yet, many people who
evacuated before Hurricane Katrina have not returned. The population is
nearly 30% lower than it was in August 2005. Many sections of the city
have still not recovered.

### Hurricanes {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVycmljYW5lcw.._10-pqj}

Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes. A **hurricane** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE2MDMtMTI.) ) is an enormous storm with
high winds and heavy rains. Hurricanes may be hundreds of kilometers
wide. They may travel for thousands of kilometers. The storm's wind
speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour.
Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones. Hurricanes are called
typhoons in the Pacific.

#### Hurricane Formation {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVycmljYW5lIEZvcm1hdGlvbg.._10-3y8}

Hurricanes are cyclones. Since they form in the tropics, they are called
tropical cyclones. These storms form over very warm ocean water in
summer and autumn. The temperature of the sea surface must be 28 ^o^ C
(82 ^o^ F) or higher. The air above the water warms and rises. This
forms a low pressure cell. The air begins to rotate around the low
pressure cell. Water vapor condenses. If conditions are right, the storm
will build into a hurricane in two to three days.

Hurricanes are huge and produce high winds. Rainfall can be as high as
2.5 cm (1") per hour. The total rainfall can be 20 billion metric tons
daily. The enormous amounts of energy released could equal the total
annual electrical power consumption of the United States. That's from
just one storm. Hurricanes can also generate tornadoes.

Hurricanes move with the prevailing winds. In the Northern Hemisphere,
they originate in the trade winds and are blown to the west. When they
reach the westerlies, they switch direction. So they travel toward the
north or northeast. You can look at a map of hurricane tracks to see
this happen ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FU0NhdGVnb3J5M0h1cnJpY2FuZVRyYWNrcw..) ).
Hurricanes may cover 800 km (500 miles) in one day.

#### The Eye of a Hurricane {#9.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEV5ZSBvZiBhIEh1cnJpY2FuZQ.._10-k5x}

At the center of a hurricane is a small area where the air is calm and
clear. This is called the eye of the hurricane ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1IdXJyaWNhbmVJZ29yMjAxMA..) ). The eye
forms at the low-pressure center of the hurricane. Air in the eye rises
upward.

The eye of this hurricane is easy to see from space.

</div>

#### The End {#9.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVuZA.._10-jpm}

Since hot water gives a hurricane its energy, the storm will grow
stronger as long as it stays over the warm ocean. If it goes ashore or
moves over cooler water, it is cut off from the hot water energy. This
sill cause the storm to lose strength and slowly fade away.

Hurricanes typically last for five to ten days. The winds push them
until they are over cooler water or land. When a hurricane
disintegrates, it is replaced with intense rains and tornadoes.

#### Classifying Hurricanes {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZnlpbmcgSHVycmljYW5lcw.._10-z0j}

Like tornadoes, hurricanes are classified on the basis of wind speed and
damage ( **Table** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6U2FmZmlyU2ltcHNvbg..)
).

  **Category**      **Wind Speed (kilometers per hour)**   **Wind Speed (miles per hour)**   **Damage**
  ----------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 (weak)          119-153                                74-95                             Above normal; no real damage to structures
  2 (moderate)      154-177                                96-110                            Some roofing, door, and window damage; considerable damage to vegetation, mobile homes, and piers
  3 (strong)        178-209                                111-130                           Some buildings damaged; mobile homes destroyed
  4 (very strong)   210-251                                131-156                           Complete roof failure on small residences; major erosion of beach areas; major damage to lower floors of structures near shore
  5 (devastating)   &gt;251                                &gt;156                           Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings; some complete building failure

#### Damage {#9.html#x-ck12-RGFtYWdl_10-ja6}

So much rain falling so fast causes some of the damage from a hurricane.
But a lot of the damage is caused by storm surge. **Storm surge** is
very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The
very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal
sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMTctU3Rvcm0tc3VyZ2U.) ).
High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also
create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the
high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high
tide, the water will rise even higher.

There are about 100 hurricanes around the world each year. There are
many smaller tropical storms and tropical depressions. As people develop
coastal regions, property damage from storms continues to rise. However,
scientists are becoming better at predicting storms. Fatalities are
decreasing. The one major exception was Hurricane Katrina.

#### Hurricane Katrina {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVycmljYW5lIEthdHJpbmE._10-vj6}

The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was unprecedented. The hurricane
season was longer than normal, and there were many more storms. The
damage from the storms was the greatest in history. The total cost was
estimated at more than \$128 billion. There were more than 2,280 deaths.

Hurricane Katrina was both the most destructive hurricane and the most
deadly. When the levees that protect the city broke, much of the city
was flooded ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1IdXJyaWNhbmVLYXRyaW5hRmxvb2Rpbmc.) ).
The hurricane was the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Nearly
2,000 people died, and damage was estimated at over \$80 billion.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-7zp}

-   Hurricanes are cyclones that form in tropical latitudes. They are
    called tropical cyclones.
-   Hurricanes have high winds that blow around a low pressure zone. In
    the low pressure zones, air moves upward. This is the eye of
    the hurricane.
-   The damage hurricanes cause is due largely to storm surge. High wind
    speeds and rain also cause damage.
-   Hurricane Katrina was so damaging because the levees that protected
    New Orleans broke.

**Where are the snowiest cities in the United States?**

Eight of the top ten cities with the highest average snowfall are in
upstate New York. This region gets so much snow because it is on the
leeward side of the Great Lakes. The area receives lake-effect snow. If
you plan to visit in winter, strap on your snow shoes!

### Winter Storms {#9.html#x-ck12-V2ludGVyIFN0b3Jtcw.._11-l0v}

Like hurricanes, winter storms develop from cyclones. But in the case of
winter storms, the cyclones form at higher latitudes. In North America,
cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter. This
lets dry polar air pour south. At the same time, warm moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico flows north. When the two air masses meet, the
differences in temperature and pressure cause strong winds and heavy
precipitation. Blizzards and lake-effect snow storms are two types of
winter storms that occur in the U.S.

#### Blizzards {#9.html#x-ck12-QmxpenphcmRz_11-t8j}

A **blizzard** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMTgtV2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1ibGl6emFyZA..) )
is a snow storm that has high winds. To be called a blizzard, a storm
must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and
visibility of ¼ mile or less because of wind-blown snow.

</div>

Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep
drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving
risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater
the wind speed, the higher the windchill. **Windchill** is what the
temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It depends
on air temperature and wind speed ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMTktV2luZGNoaWxsLWNoYXJ0) ). Higher
windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful
effects of cold sooner than if the wind isn't blowing.

Windchill temperatures may be very low in blizzards because of the high
wind speeds. How long does it take for frostbite to occur when the air
temperature is 0° F and the wind speed is 55 miles per hour?

</div>

#### Lake-Effect Snow {#9.html#x-ck12-TGFrZS1FZmZlY3QgU25vdw.._11-jwi}

Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter. If they
are near a lake, they may be getting **lake-effect snow** . The image
below shows how lake-effect snow occurs ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjAtTGFrZS1lZmZlY3Qtc25vdw..) ).
Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm
waters of a large lake. When the winds reach the cold land on the other
side, the air cools. Since there was so much moisture in the air, it can
drop a lot of snow. More than 254 centimeters (100 inches) of snow may
fall in a single lake-effect storm!

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-osu}

-   Blizzards are often part of a mid-latitude cyclone. The jet stream
    brings cold air into contact with warm moist air.
-   The difference in pressure between the air masses brings about
    strong winds.
-   Cold polar air absorbs moisture as it travels over the Great Lakes.
    The air cools when it goes back over land and then dumps snow. This
    creates lake-effect snow.

**Is the current drought like the Dust Bowl?**

The worst heat wave in U.S. history came in 1936. The already struggling
Midwest was hit hard by extreme temperatures and drought. Crops were
destroyed, and more than 5,000 people died. The Midwest and Southwest
are currently suffering with drought. While serious, it is not yet a
situation like the Dust Bowl.

### Heat Waves {#9.html#x-ck12-SGVhdCBXYXZlcw.._12-yks}

A **heat wave** is different depending on its location. A region has a
heat wave if it has more than five consecutive days of temperatures that
are more than 9 ^o^ F (5 ^o^ C) above average. A heat wave in Portland,
Oregon might be just an average warm week in Phoenix, Arizona.

Heat waves have increased in frequency and duration in recent years. The
summer 2011 North American heat wave brought record temperatures across
the Midwestern and Eastern United States. Many states and localities
broke records for temperature and for the most days above 100 ^o^ F.

#### Causes {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2Vz_12-1xp}

A high pressure cell sitting over a region with no movement is the
likely cause of a heat wave.

What do you think caused the heat wave in the image below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTYtNDgtSGVhdC13YXZl) )? A high pressure
zone kept the jet stream farther north than normal for August.

</div>

### Droughts {#9.html#x-ck12-RHJvdWdodHM._12-mkc}

**Droughts** also depend on what is normal for a region. A region that
gets significantly less precipitation than normal for an extended period
of time is in drought. The Southern United States is experiencing an
ongoing and prolonged drought.

Drought has many consequences. When soil loses moisture it may blow
away. This happened during the Dust Bowl in the United States in the
1930s. Forests may be lost, dust storms may become common, and wildlife
are disturbed. Wildfires become much more common during times of
drought.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-ilg}

-   A heat wave or a drought is defined as conditions different from
    normal in a region.
-   A heat wave is caused when a warm high-pressure cell sits over
    a region.
-   Drought may have extremely severe consequences. The severity depends
    on its duration and intensity.

**What does a meteorologist need before he or she can forecast the
weather?**

Data! A meteorologist needs data about the current conditions. There are
many types of instruments available for collecting that data. According
to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a 5-day weather forecast
today is as reliable as a 2-day forecast was 20 years ago.

### Predicting the Weather {#9.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGljdGluZyB0aGUgV2VhdGhlcg.._13-9ld}

Weather is very difficult to predict. That’s because it’s very complex,
and many factors are involved. Slight changes in even one factor can
cause a big change in the weather. Still, certain “rules of thumb”
generally apply. These “rules” help meteorologists forecast the weather.
For example, low pressure is likely to bring stormy weather. So if a
center of low pressure is moving your way, you can expect a storm.

People often complain when the weather forecast is wrong. Weather
forecasts today, however, are much more accurate than they were just 20
years ago. Scientists who study and forecast the weather are called
meteorologists. How do they predict the weather?

The first thing they need is data. Their data comes from various
instruments.

### Weather Instruments {#9.html#x-ck12-V2VhdGhlciBJbnN0cnVtZW50cw.._13-sbg}

Weather instruments measure weather conditions. One of the most
important conditions is air pressure, which is measured with a
**barometer** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjMtQmFyb21ldGVy) ). There are also a
number of other commonly used weather instruments ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjQtV2VhdGhlci1pbnN0cnVtZW50cw..) ):

-   A **thermometer** measures temperature.
-   An **anemometer** measures wind speed.
-   A **rain gauge** measures the amount of rain.
-   A **hygrometer** measures humidity.
-   A **wind vane** shows wind direction.
-   A **snow gauge** measures the amount of snow.

#### Collecting Data {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29sbGVjdGluZyBEYXRh_13-des}

Weather instruments collect data from all over the world at thousands of
weather stations ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjctV2VhdGhlci1kYXRhLWNvbGxlY3Rpbmc.)
). Many are on land, but some float in the oceans on buoys. There’s
probably at least one weather station near you.

Other weather devices are needed to collect weather data in the
atmosphere. They include weather balloons, satellites, and **radar** (
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjctV2VhdGhlci1kYXRhLWNvbGxlY3Rpbmc.)
).

**Figure 9.32**

Weather stations collect data on land and sea. Weather balloons,
satellites, and radar collect data in the atmosphere.

</div>

**Weather stations** contain many instruments for measuring weather
conditions. The **weather balloon** ( **Figure**
[above](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjctV2VhdGhlci1kYXRhLWNvbGxlY3Rpbmc.)
) will rise into the atmosphere until it bursts. As it rises, it will
gather weather data and send it to the surface. Many **weather
satellites** orbit Earth. They constantly collect and transmit weather
data from high above the surface. A radar device sends out radio waves
in all directions. The waves bounce off water in the atmosphere and then
return to the sender. The radar data shows where precipitation is
falling. It’s raining in the orange-shaded area shown above.

#### Using Computers {#9.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgQ29tcHV0ZXJz_13-fry}

What do meteorologists do with all that weather data? They use it in
weather models. The models analyze the data and predict the weather. The
models require computers. That’s because so many measurements and
calculations are involved.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-jht}

-   Various instruments measure weather conditions: thermometers measure
    air temperature, and barometers measure air pressure.
-   Satellites monitor weather from above.
-   Radar is used to monitor precipitation.

**What can a weather map tell you about the weather?**

A lot! A weather map indicates all sorts of things to let you know the
forecast. It also may have some cute graphics associated with it.

### Weather Maps {#9.html#x-ck12-V2VhdGhlciBNYXBz_14-o91}

You may have seen weather maps like the one pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjgtV2VhdGhlci1tYXA.) ). A **weather
map** shows weather conditions for a certain area. The map may show the
actual weather on a given day. It may show the predicted weather for
some time in the future. Some weather maps show many weather conditions.
Others show a single condition.

This weather map shows air pressure contours. Which state has the lowest
air pressure shown on the map?

</div>

#### Air Pressure Maps {#9.html#x-ck12-QWlyIFByZXNzdXJlIE1hcHM._14-bsh}

The weather map pictured below ( **Figure**
[above](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTYtMjgtV2VhdGhlci1tYXA.) ) shows air
pressure. The lines on the map connect places that have the same air
pressure. Air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar.
**Isobars** are the lines that connect the points with the same air
pressure. The map also shows low- and high-pressure centers and fronts.
Find the cold front on the map. This cold front is likely to move toward
the northeast over the next couple of days. How could you use this
information to predict what the weather will be on the East Coast?

#### Other Weather Maps {#9.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgV2VhdGhlciBNYXBz_14-kn1}

Instead of air pressure, weather maps may show other weather conditions.
For example, a temperature map might show the high and low temperatures
of major cities. The map may have **isotherms** , lines that connect
places with the same temperature.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-6uq}

-   Weather maps graphically depict weather conditions.
-   Isobars are lines of constant pressure.
-   Isobars indicate pressure cells.

**Where in Hawaii do you want to go?**

Look at a list of cities with the best climate in the United States.
Hawaii is well represented. Now look at a list of cities with the worst
climate in the United States. (You know where this is going, don't you?)
Yes, Hawaii is also represented. Kona and Hilo are both on the Big
Island. Hilo is on the windward side where the trade winds bring in
moisture from the Pacific. Kona is on the leeward side, beyond the high
volcanic mountains. This city lies within the rain shadow. Guess which
city is more popular with tourists?

### What is Climate? {#9.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBDbGltYXRlPw.._15-kjs}

Almost anything can happen with the weather. Climate, however, is more
predictable. **Climate** is the long-term average of weather in a
particular spot. Good climate is why we choose to vacation in Hawaii in
February (usually on the leeward side). Of course, the weather is not
guaranteed to be good! A location’s climate considers the same
characteristics as its weather. These are its air temperature, humidity,
wind speed and direction, and the type, quantity, and frequency of
precipitation. For climate, these things are averaged over time.

During the mid- to late-twentieth century, California received an
enormous influx of new residents. Many of these people came from the
northeastern United States. They were sick of the cold, snow, and rain.
Southern California, especially near the coast, has a nearly perfect
climate. The average lows and highs in San Diego year round are in the
50s, 60s, and 70s ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaXNzaW9uQmF5U2FuRGllZ28.) ).

The climate for a particular place is steady. Changes occur only very
slowly. Climate is determined by many factors, including the angle of
the Sun, the likelihood of cloud cover, and the air pressure. All of
these factors are related to the amount of solar energy that hits that
location over time.

The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things.
These factors are described in the next sections.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-xdz}

-   Climate is the long-term average of weather.

**Do you want to be a Snowbird?**

A Snowbird is usually a person who is retired. Like a migrating bird,
they go where the weather is good. A snowbird may spend summers "at
home" in Michigan or New York. But they travel to Arizona or Florida to
spend their winters in the Sun and warmth. What would a reverse snowbird
be? A person who spent summers in the 100+ degree heat and winters in
the sub-0 cold. Brrrr....

### Latitude and Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-TGF0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIENsaW1hdGU._16-bpu}

**Latitude** is the distance north or south of the Equator. It’s
measured in degrees, from 0° to 90°. Several climate factors vary with
latitude.

#### Latitude and Temperature {#9.html#x-ck12-TGF0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIFRlbXBlcmF0dXJl_16-kfi}

Temperature changes with latitude ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbG9iYWxBdmVyYWdlVGVtcGVyYXR1cmU.) ).

-   At the Equator, the Sun’s rays are most direct. This is where
    temperatures are highest.
-   At higher latitudes, the Sun’s rays are less direct. The farther an
    area is from the Equator, the lower its temperature.
-   At the poles, the Sun’s rays are least direct. Much of the area is
    covered with ice and snow, which reflect a lot of sunlight.

**Would you like to go to the horse latitudes?**

Imagine you're on a sailing ship that's carrying horses among other
cargo. You want to go from Spain to northern South America. For a smooth
ride west, you need to get the ship into the trade winds. But where the
trade winds and the westerlies meet is a zone where air flows vertically
downward. It's hard to get through there in a sailing ship. So your ship
gets stuck. For weeks. There's no more water or food for the horses so
you throw them overboard. Some people think this is where the horse
latitudes got their name.

### More Effects of Latitude on Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-TW9yZSBFZmZlY3RzIG9mIExhdGl0dWRlIG9uIENsaW1hdGU._17-14o}

We saw that the amount of solar radiation an area receives depends on
its latitude. The amount of solar radiation affects the temperature of a
region. Latitude has other effects on climate.

#### Latitude and Prevailing Winds {#9.html#x-ck12-TGF0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIFByZXZhaWxpbmcgV2luZHM._17-kyg}

Global air currents cause global winds. The figure below shows the
direction that these winds blow ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMDQtR2xvYmFsLXdpbmRz) ). Global winds
are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude. The winds move
air masses, which causes weather.

The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass
usually moves over an area. For example, a west wind might bring warm
moist air from over an ocean. An east wind might bring cold dry air from
over a mountain range. Which wind prevails has a big effect on the
climate. What if the prevailing winds are westerlies? The westerlies
blow from nearer the Equator to farther from the Equator. How would they
affect the climate?

#### Latitude and Precipitation {#9.html#x-ck12-TGF0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIFByZWNpcGl0YXRpb24._17-w5i}

Global air currents affect precipitation. How they affect it varies with
latitude ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMDMtR2xvYmFsLWFpci1jdXJyZW50cw..) ).
Where air rises, it cools and there is precipitation. Where air sinks,
it warms and causes evaporation. These patterns are part of the global
wind belts.

**Is latitude making the difference in weather in these three cities?**

No. These three cities are at the same latitude. They are San Francisco,
California; Wichita, Kansas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Proximity to
the ocean is important. Also important is the direction the winds are
blowing at this location.

### Oceans and Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5zIGFuZCBDbGltYXRl_18-cy9}

When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the
climate.

#### Coastal and Inland Climates {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29hc3RhbCBhbmQgSW5sYW5kIENsaW1hdGVz_18-ipx}

Places at the same latitude may have very different climates if one is
on a coast and one is inland.

-   On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from
    the ocean. A coastal climate is usually mild. Summers aren’t too
    hot, and winters aren’t too cold. Precipitation can be high due to
    the moisture in the air. This is a **maritime climate** .
-   Farther inland, the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from
    the land. This air may be dry, because it comes from over land. An
    inland climate is usually more extreme. Winters may be very cold,
    and summers may be very hot. Precipitation can be low. This is a
    **continental climate** .

#### The Influence of the Ocean {#9.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEluZmx1ZW5jZSBvZiB0aGUgT2NlYW4._18-pdu}

The ocean has a big effect on climate. This is obvious when you compare
the temperatures of these three cities. Each of these cities is located
at 37°N latitude, within the westerly winds ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtUmV2LTE3LVdlYXRoZXJfbWFw) ).

Beach](ck12_9_files/20150911025852750294.jpeg "Difference in climate between San Francisco, Wichita, and Virginia Beach")

**Figure 9.40**

How does the ocean influence the climate of these three cities?

</div>

The climate of San Francisco is influenced by the Pacific Ocean. The
cool California current comes from the north. Upwelling brings cold
water from the deep. So the water offshore is cold. Virginia Beach is
near the Atlantic Ocean. But its temperatures are more like Wichita than
San Francisco. Why is the climate in Virginia Beach less influenced by
the ocean than San Francisco? *Hint* : Think about the direction the
winds are going at that latitude. The weather in San Francisco comes
from over the Pacific Ocean. Much of the weather in Virginia comes from
the continent.

#### Ocean Currents and Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW4gQ3VycmVudHMgYW5kIENsaW1hdGU._18-eh4}

Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the world’s oceans.
They help to even out the temperatures in the oceans. This also affects
the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world.
Currents that are near shore have a direct impact on climate. They may
make the climate much colder or warmer. Examples of this are pictured
below ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTQtMjAtR29sZnN0cmVhbQ..) ).

into northern Europe. The warm water raises temperatures in the British
Isles.

</div>

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-j4l}

-   A maritime climate is influenced by a nearby ocean. A continental
    climate is influenced by nearby land.
-   The temperature of offshore currents affect nearby land areas.
-   A maritime climate is less extreme than a continental climate,
    because the ocean moderates temperatures.

**How much does the climate vary across Washington State?**

The first photo is of Olympic National Park by the Pacific Ocean. The
area is wet; very, very wet. Moving eastward, you find Mt. Baker, one of
the Cascades volcanoes. The climate on the mountain is very different
from the climate near the ocean. It is extremely cold with abundant
snowfall in winter. The third photo is of eastern Washington. Much of
the land is farmed. The climate is much drier for two reasons. Can you
determine what they are?

### Mountains and Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-TW91bnRhaW5zIGFuZCBDbGltYXRl_19-7d0}

Did you ever hike or drive up a mountain? Did you notice that it was
cooler near the top? Climate is not just different on a mountain. Just
having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate.

#### Altitude and Temperature {#9.html#x-ck12-QWx0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIFRlbXBlcmF0dXJl_19-uqm}

Air temperature falls at higher altitudes ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMDYtQWlyLXRlbXBlcmF0dXJlLXZzLWhlaWdodA..)
). Why does this happen? Since air is less dense at higher altitudes,
its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level. These
molecules have fewer collisions, so they produce less heat.

#### Mountains and Precipitation {#9.html#x-ck12-TW91bnRhaW5zIGFuZCBQcmVjaXBpdGF0aW9u_19-r3x}

Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges
can cast a **rain shadow** . As winds rise up the windward side of a
mountain range, the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side
of the range, the leeward side, the air is dry, and it sinks. So there
is very little precipitation on the leeward side of a mountain range.
The figure below shows how this happens ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMDgtUmFpbi1zaGFkb3c.) ).

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-wgh}

-   Where air is denser, the air temperature is higher.
-   Rainshadow effect occurs on the leeward side of a mountain range.
-   Maritime air may become stuck on the windward side of a
    mountain range. For this reason it is unable to bring cooler air
    farther inland.

**How are altitude and latitude similar?**

The top of Mt. Humphreys (top), the highest point in Arizona, is 12,637
feet (3,852 m). Only a few plants can live in this harsh environment.
The life zone is tundra. Tundra is also seen in high latitudes, like
Denali National Park in Alaska (bottom). Denali is at 63° north.

### Major Climate Types {#9.html#x-ck12-TWFqb3IgQ2xpbWF0ZSBUeXBlcw.._20-ofg}

Major climate types are based on temperature and precipitation. Latitude
plays an important role in determining the climate of a region. However,
many other factors play a role in climate. Oceans and mountain ranges
influence climate in the same ways worldwide ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Xb3JsZENsaW1hdGVz) ). You can see
where the climate types are on the map, and then read about them below.

**Figure 9.45**

Find where you live on the map. What type of climate do you have?

</div>

Temperature and precipitation determine what types of plants can grow in
an area. Animals and other living things depend on plants. So each
climate is associated with certain types of living things. A major type
of climate and its living things make up a **biome** . As you read about
the major climate types below, find them on the map above ( **Figure**
[above](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Xb3JsZENsaW1hdGVz) ).

#### Altitude and Latitude {#9.html#x-ck12-QWx0aXR1ZGUgYW5kIExhdGl0dWRl_20-ldh}

Altitude mimics latitude in climate zones. Climates and biomes typical
of higher latitudes may be found at high altitudes.

Arizona is a state with a large elevation change. In the late 1800s, C.
Hart Merriam noticed that the plant life changed with altitude in the
same way it changes with latitude. So on a trip from Phoenix up to the
top of the mountain, you could see all of these life zones ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbHRpdHVkZUNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) ):

### Microclimates {#9.html#x-ck12-TWljcm9jbGltYXRlcw.._20-6j0}

Climate conditions in a small area may be different from those of the
surroundings. The climate of the small area is called a **microclimate**
. The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings
since cold air sinks. The ground surface may be hotter or colder than
the air a few feet above it. This is because rock and soil gain and lose
heat readily. Different sides of a mountain will have different
microclimates. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing slope receives
more solar energy than a north-facing slope. Each side supports
different amounts and types of vegetation.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-z1v}

-   Altitude and latitude produce similar climate zones and life zones.
-   A biome is a climate zone and the plants and animals that live
    in it.
-   A microclimate has different climate conditions from the
    surrounding regions.

**What kind of climate is this?**

Whether a place is wet all year round or dry for some time really
affects what can grow there. In the tropics, places that are wet year
round have lush vegetation. Places that are dry some of the time are
much less lush.

### Tropical Climates {#9.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGljYWwgQ2xpbWF0ZXM._21-6gf}

Tropical climates are found around the Equator. As you'd expect, these
climates have warm temperatures year round. The warm air rises at the
Equator. As it rises, it cools, causing it to rain. Tropical climates
may be very wet, or wet and dry.

#### Tropical Wet Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGljYWwgV2V0IENsaW1hdGU._21-umf}

Tropical wet climates occur at or very near the Equator. They have high
rainfall year round. **Tropical rainforests** ( **FIgure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NYWxheXNpYVRyb3BpY2FsUmFpbmZvcmVzdA..)
) grow in this type of climate.

#### Tropical Wet and Dry Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGljYWwgV2V0IGFuZCBEcnkgQ2xpbWF0ZQ.._21-t5v}

Tropical wet and dry climates occur between 5° and 20° latitude and
receive less rainfall. Most of the rain falls in a single season. The
rest of the year is dry. Few trees can withstand the long dry season, so
the main plants are grasses ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1LZW55YW5HcmFzc2xhbmRz) ). Wildlife
thrive on these grasslands.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-bev}

-   Tropical climates are found at or near the Equator. Because warm air
    rises at the Equator, there is a lot of rain.
-   Tropical wet climates get rain year round. Tropical rainforests grow
    in this climate zone.
-   Tropical wet and dry climates have a rainy season and a dry season.
    The vegetation is largely grass.

**How do plants that evolved in different places end up being so
similar?**

Organisms evolve to fit the conditions they are in. There are only so
many ways to minimize the use of water. Plants in arid climates evolve
very similar structures to lessen water use. They also have structures
to protect themselves from the Sun. The cactus on the right is from
South America. The cactus on the left is from North America. These
plants are just one of many examples of organisms evolving under very
similar conditions and turning out to be very similar.

### Dry Climates {#9.html#x-ck12-RHJ5IENsaW1hdGVz_22-ch7}

Dry climates receive very little rainfall. They also have high rates of
evaporation. This makes them even drier.

#### Deserts {#9.html#x-ck12-RGVzZXJ0cw.._22-ah0}

The driest climates are **deserts** . Most occur between about 15° and
30° latitude. This is where dry air sinks to the surface in the global
circulation cells. Deserts receive less than 25 centimeters (10 inches)
of rain per year. They may be covered with sand dunes or be home to
sparse but hardy plants. With few clouds, many deserts have hot days and
cool nights.

**Figure 9.49**

Some deserts receive a small amount of rain during the winter and again
during the summer. This is enough to keep plants alive as in the left
photo. Some deserts receive very little rain or rain only one season a
year. These deserts have few plants as in the right photo.

</div>

#### Steppes {#9.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHBlcw.._22-zl7}

Other dry climates get a little more precipitation. They are called
**steppes** . These regions have short grasses and low bushes (
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdGVwcGVJbk1vbmdvbGlh) ).
Steppes occur at higher latitudes than deserts. They are dry because
they are in continental interiors or rain shadows.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-wpx}

-   Deserts receive very little rainfall. They are often home to very
    unusual and well adapted plants.
-   Steppes receive more rain than deserts. They are higher and have
    grasses and scrub.
-   Plants adapt to local conditions. If conditions are the same but the
    plants are far apart, they may still be very similar.

**What do these photos have in common? What's different?**

Both photos have grapevines and old looking stone buildings. The Sun is
shining. The photo on the right is in California, where wine has become
an enormous business in recent decades. On the left is an ancient
village in Tuscany in Italy. These locations both have a Mediterranean
climate, which is good for wine, olive oil, artichokes, and an
tremendous number of other agricultural products.

### Temperate Climates {#9.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXRlIENsaW1hdGVz_23-mvt}

Temperate climates have moderate temperatures. These climates vary in
how much rain they get and when the rain falls.

#### Mediterranean Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-TWVkaXRlcnJhbmVhbiBDbGltYXRl_23-cls}

Mediterranean climates are found on the western coasts of continents.
The latitudes are between 30° and 45°. The coast of California has a
Mediterranean climate. Temperatures are mild, and rainfall is moderate.
Most of the rain falls in the winter, and summers are dry. To make it
through the dry summers, short woody plants are common ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NYW56YW5pdGE.) ).

#### Marine West Coast Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-TWFyaW5lIFdlc3QgQ29hc3QgQ2xpbWF0ZQ.._23-1je}

Marine west coast climates are also found on the western coasts of
continents. They occur between 45° and 60° latitude. The coast of
Washington State has this type of climate. Temperatures are mild, and
there’s plenty of rainfall all year round. Dense fir forests grow in
this climate ( **Figure**

#### Humid Subtropical Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVtaWQgU3VidHJvcGljYWwgQ2xpbWF0ZQ.._23-zys}

Humid subtropical climates are found on the eastern sides of continents
between about 20° and 40° latitude. The southeastern U.S. has this type
of climate. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are chilly. There is
moderate rainfall throughout the year. Pine and oak forests grow in this
climate ( **Figure**

**Where don't you go to experience a continental climate?**

There are no continental climates in the Southern Hemisphere. Can you
guess why? Continental climates are between 40° and 70°. The southern
continents at this latitude are too narrow. All of their inland areas
are close enough to a coast to be affected by the ocean!

### Continental Climates {#9.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50YWwgQ2xpbWF0ZXM._24-ny1}

Continental climates are found in inland areas. They are too far from
oceans to experience the effects of ocean water. Continental climates
are common between 40° and 70° north latitude.

#### Humid Continental Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-SHVtaWQgQ29udGluZW50YWwgQ2xpbWF0ZQ.._24-mbc}

Humid continental climates are found between 40° and 60° north latitude.
The northeastern U.S. has this type of climate. Summers are warm to hot,
and winters are cold. Precipitation is moderate, and it falls year
round. Deciduous trees grow in this climate ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BdXR1bW5JblZlcm1vbnQy) ). They lose
their leaves in the fall and grow new ones in the spring.

#### Subarctic Climate {#9.html#x-ck12-U3ViYXJjdGljIENsaW1hdGU._24-n72}

Subarctic climates are found between 60° and 70° north latitude. Much of
Canada and Alaska have this type of climate. Summers are cool and short.
Winters are very cold and long. Little precipitation falls, and most of
it falls during the summer. Conifer forests grow in this climate (
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1KYXNwZXJOYXRpb25hbFBhcmtDYW5hZGE.) ).

**What types of animals live here?**

The polar climate is harsh. Plants are small and low to the ground. What
types of animals can live under these conditions? In alpine areas, small
mammals that seek protection in rocks are common. The marmot on the left
is an example. Large animals must be prepared to live exposed to frigid
cold. Musk ox live in the farthest north parts of North America and
Greenland. Additionally, large animals like caribou can migrate to more
hospitable places in winter.

### Polar Climates {#9.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgQ2xpbWF0ZXM._25-ytj}

Polar climates are found near the North and South Poles. They also occur
on high mountains at lower latitudes. The summers are very cool, and the
winters are frigid. Precipitation is very low because it’s so cold. The
growing season is very short. **Tundra** prefers areas of permafrost.
**Permafrost** is a lower layer of soil that is permanently frozen.
Tundra also refers to a treeless plain with small plants. You can see
examples of polar climates pictured below.

#### Polar Tundra {#9.html#x-ck12-UG9sYXIgVHVuZHJh_25-dbh}

The polar tundra climate ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ob3J0aHdlc3RUZXJyaXRvcmllc1R1bmRyYQ..)
) occurs near the poles. Tundra climates have permafrost. Permafrost is
layer of ground below the surface that is always frozen, even in the
summer. Only small plants, such as mosses, can grow in this climate.

The alpine tundra climates ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db2xvcmFkb0FscGluZVR1bmRyYQ..) )
occurs at high altitudes at any latitude. They are also called highland
climates. These regions are very cold because they are so far above sea
level. The alpine tundra climate is very similar to the polar tundra
climate.

#### Ice Caps {#9.html#x-ck12-SWNlIENhcHM._25-sc4}

Ice caps are areas covered with thick ice year round. Ice caps are found
only in Greenland and Antarctica. Temperatures and precipitation are
both very low. What little snow falls usually stays on the ground. It
doesn’t melt because it’s too cold.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-gyk}

-   Tundra is land with permafrost, no trees, and small hardy plants.
-   Permafrost is land with permanently frozen soil.
-   Tundra is found near the poles and up on high mountains.

**How important was the Pleistocene ice age to human evolution?**

Climate is dynamic; climate has changed through Earth's history. Climate
has changed a lot during the time humans have been evolving. As the
climate got colder, people learned to hunt more since plants became
scarce in the winter. Better hunting required better tools. Better tools
helped to spur on the evolution of culture.

### How Earth’s Climate Changes {#9.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVhcnRo4oCZcyBDbGltYXRlIENoYW5nZXM._26-136}

Earth’s climate has changed many times through Earth's history. Over
much of Earth’s past, the climate was warmer than it is today. Picture
in your mind dinosaurs roaming the land. They're probably doing it in a
pretty warm climate ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbXBlbG9zYXVydXM.) )!

**Figure 9.58**

Dinosaurs thrived during one of the warmest periods in Earth's history.

</div>

But ice ages also occurred many times in the past. An **ice age** is a
period when temperatures are cooler than normal. This causes glaciers to
spread to lower latitudes. Scientists think that ice ages occurred at
least six times over the last billion years alone. How do scientists
learn about Earth’s past climates?

The last major ice age took place in the Pleistocene. This epoch lasted
from 2 million to 14,000 years ago. Earth’s temperature was only 5° C
(9° F) cooler than it is today. But glaciers covered much of the
Northern Hemisphere. Below, you can see how far south they went (
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMTctUGxlaXN0b2NlbmUtZ2xhY2llcnM.) ).
Clearly, a small change in temperature can have a big impact on the
planet. Humans lived during this ice age.

### Why Climate Changes {#9.html#x-ck12-V2h5IENsaW1hdGUgQ2hhbmdlcw.._26-joy}

Several natural processes may affect Earth’s temperature. They range
from sunspots to Earth’s wobble.

-   **Sunspots** are storms on the Sun. When the number of sunspots is
    high, the Sun gives off more energy than usual. Still, there is
    little evidence for climate changing along with the sunspot cycle.
-   Plate movements cause continents to drift closer to the poles or
    the Equator. Ocean currents also shift when continents drift. All
    these changes can affect Earth’s temperature.
-   Plate movements trigger volcanoes. A huge eruption could spew so
    much gas and ash into the air that little sunlight wouldn't reach
    the surface for months or years. This could lower
    Earth’s temperature.
-   A large **asteroid** hitting Earth would throw a lot of dust into
    the air. This could block sunlight and cool the planet.
-   Earth goes through regular changes in its position relative to
    the Sun. Its orbit changes slightly. Earth also wobbles on its axis
    of rotation. The planet also changes its **axial tilt** , the angle
    of its axis of rotation. These changes can affect
    Earth’s temperature.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-bbt}

-   Earth's climate has been warmer and colder, but mostly warmer,
    through Earth history.
-   Many natural processes change Earth's climate. These include
    sunspots, plate tectonics, volcanism, asteroid impacts, and
    Earth's motions.
-   The Pleistocene Ice Age lasted from 2 million to 14,000 years ago.
    Earth’s temperature was only 5° C (9° F) cooler than it is today.

This video deals with the time period at the end of the Paleozoic,
called the Permian, 250,000,000 years ago. At that time there was a
great mass extinction. Since it was so long ago, scientists must use
many types of evidence to determine its cause.

1.  What were therapsids? What was their great accomplishment?
2.  What occurred 250 million years ago?
3.  What natural disaster occurred at around the same time?
4.  How much warming did Peter Ward calculate could have happened as a
    result of this natural disaster? What evidence did he use for his
    calculation?
5.  Did this explain the mass extinction at the end of the Permian? Why
    or why not?

**What are short term climate changes?**

El Niño and La Niña bring about dramatic changes in climate for a year
or two. In some locations, one brings rain and the other brings drought.
In California, for example, El Niño years are full of snow and rain. La
Niña years tend toward drought. These variations can bring tremendous
changes to living creatures. Humans are also affected; for example,
erosion from storms may be very high some years.

### Short-Term Climate Change {#9.html#x-ck12-U2hvcnQtVGVybSBDbGltYXRlIENoYW5nZQ.._27-qu4}

You’ve probably heard of El Niño and La Niña. These terms refer to
certain short-term changes in climate. The changes are natural and occur
in cycles, lasting from days to years. El Niño and La Niña are not the
only short-term climate changes. Others include the Pacific decadal
oscillation and the North Atlantic oscillation. El Niño and La Niña are
the most noticeable and discussed.

To understand El Niño and La Niña, you first need to know what happens
in normal years ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMjQtTm9ybWFsLXllYXI.) ).

This diagram represents the Pacific Ocean in a normal year. North and
South America are the brown shapes on the right.

</div>

#### El Niño {#9.html#x-ck12-RWwgTmnDsW8._27-zcw}

During an **El Niño** , the western Pacific Ocean is warmer than usual.
This causes the trade winds to change direction. The winds blow from
west to east instead of east to west ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMjUtRWwtTmlubw..) ). The change in
the trade winds also causes the jet streams to be north of their normal
location. The warm water travels east across the Equator, too. Warm
water piles up along the western coast of South America. This prevents
upwelling. Why do you think this is true?

These changes in water temperature, winds, and currents affect climates
worldwide. The changes usually last a year or two. Some places get more
rain than normal. Other places get less. In many locations, the weather
is more severe.

#### La Niña {#9.html#x-ck12-TGEgTmnDsWE._27-dly}

**La Niña** ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMjYtTGEtTmluYQ..) ) generally follows
El Niño. It occurs when the Pacific Ocean is cooler than normal. The
trade winds are like they are in a normal year. They blow from east to
west. But in a La Niña, the winds are stronger than usual. More cool
water builds up in the western Pacific. These changes can also affect
climates worldwide.

Some scientists think that global warming is affecting the cycle of El
Niño and La Niña. These short-term changes seem to be cycling faster now
than in the past. They are also more extreme.

An online guide to El Niño and La Niña events from the University of
Illinois is found here:
[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/eln/home.rxml](home.rxml)
.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-n0c}

-   El Niño and La Niña are two examples of short-term climate changes
    lasting one to a few years.
-   In an El Niño, the trade winds reverse direction, as do the
    equatorial surface currents. This causes warm water to pool off of
    South America and stop upwelling.
-   A La Niña is like normal conditions only more so.

**How can things change so quickly?**

Glaciers and ice sheets are melting. This can be seen clearly in
photographs. The glaciers advanced during the Pleistocene ice age. They
have been melting back since then, except for during the Little Ice Age.
However, the rate of melting has increased tremendously in recent
decades.

### Temperature Variations {#9.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmUgVmFyaWF0aW9ucw.._28-okw}

Since the end of the Pleistocene, Earth’s temperature has risen. The
image below shows how it changed over just the last 1500 years (
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy0yMDAweWVhclRlbXBlcmF0dXJlUmVjb3Jk) ).
The Medieval Warm Period was a time of somewhat higher average
temperatures. The Little Ice Age was a time of somewhat lower average
temperatures. But for each time, the anomaly (the difference from
average temperature) was less than 1° C (1.8° F). Still, the overall
trend is slightly upward.

### Recent Temperature Trends {#9.html#x-ck12-UmVjZW50IFRlbXBlcmF0dXJlIFRyZW5kcw.._28-q6d}

Since the mid 1800s, Earth has warmed up quickly ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbG9iYWxMYW5kT2NlYW5UZW1wSW5kZXg.) ).
The 14 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1900. By the end
of 2013, 13 of the 14 hottest years ever have occurred since 2000! This
temperature rise is what is usually meant by **global warming** .

**What is the human cost of warmer temperatures?**

Many lands are marginal for farming. When rainfall is normal or high,
the lands can produce. When rainfall is low, no crops grow. Drought
makes marginal lands unsuitable for farming. Drought can also make good
lands more difficult to farm. These changes will increase as
temperatures warm.

### Causes of Global Warming {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIEdsb2JhbCBXYXJtaW5n_29-dtd}

The average global temperature has been rising since the end of the
Pleistocene. With some ups and downs, of course. Rising temperatures are
natural for this time period. But natural causes cannot explain all the
warming that's been happening. There is some other factor at work.

Recent **global warming** is due mainly to human actions. The actions
involve releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Remember that
greenhouse gases keep the atmosphere warm? And that carbon dioxide is a
greenhouse gas? When you burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released
into the atmosphere. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the
better the atmosphere can trap heat. In other words, an increase in
greenhouse gases leads to greater greenhouse effect. The result is
increased global warming. Pictured below is the increase in carbon
dioxide since 1960 ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NYXVuYUxvYUNPMkxldmVscw..) ).

Burning forests also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Other
human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. For
example, growing rice and raising livestock both produce methane.

### Effects of Global Warming {#9.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBHbG9iYWwgV2FybWluZw.._29-vid}

There are already many effects of global warming being seen. As Earth
has gotten warmer, sea ice has melted. This has raised the level of
water in the oceans ( **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UcmVuZHNJbkdsb2JhbFNlYUxldmVs) ).

</div>

Other effects of global warming include more extreme weather. Earth now
has more severe storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts than it did
just a few decades ago. Many living things cannot adjust to the changing
climate. Coral reefs in many parts of the world are struggling to
survive. Species are moving uphill where temperatures are cooler. Those
at the top of the mountain are being run off. Migration and egg-laying
behaviors in birds are off of their normal. There are many more examples
of the effects of changing climate.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-ep8}

-   Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels
    and other human activities release greenhouse gases into
    the atmosphere.
-   Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are increasing. Global
    temperatures are increasing.
-   Changes due to increasing temperatures are seen around the globe.
    Living organisms and humans are also affected.

**“The Inuit see this and the world should know this...”**

“It’s happening right before our eyes” — 23-year-old Jordan Konek is one
of the **Inuit** , the native people of the Arctic. He told this to the
2011 Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa. Native people in
the Arctic see changes much more than people in lower latitudes. More
warming is occurring in the polar regions.

### How Will Climate Change in the Future? {#9.html#x-ck12-SG93IFdpbGwgQ2xpbWF0ZSBDaGFuZ2UgaW4gdGhlIEZ1dHVyZT8._30-mor}

Earth’s temperature will keep rising unless greenhouse gas emissions are
curbed. The temperature in 2100 may be as much as 5° C (9° F) higher
than it was in 2000. Is 5° C (9° F) a lot? It's more than the increase
in temperature from the the times of maximum ice during the Pleistocene
to now. Since the end of the Pleistocene, the temperature has only risen
about 4° C. That's just 4° C from abundant ice to the moderate climate
we have today. How might a 5° C increase in temperature affect Earth in
the future?

Warming will affect the entire globe by the end of this century. The map
in the **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbG9iYWxUZW1wUHJlZGljdGlvbnM.) shows
how much temperatures will change in different regions based on the
Coupled Climate 2.1 model. In what place is the temperature increase the
greatest? Where in the United States is the temperature increase the
highest?

### What Will Happen {#9.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBXaWxsIEhhcHBlbg.._30-apl}

As temperature rises, more sea ice will melt. The figure below shows how
much less sea ice there may be in 2050 if temperatures keep going up (
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTctMjMtU2VhLWljZS10aGlja25lc3M.) ). This
would cause sea level to rise even higher. Some coastal cities could be
under water. Millions of people would have to move inland. How might
other living things be affected?

Weather will become more extreme. Heat waves and droughts will become
more frequent and more intense. The Midwestern United States will become
hot and dry. This will make growing food more difficult. Cropland
worldwide will be affected. Hurricanes may become more severe.

Plants and animals will move or die out. Some will thrive in a warmer
world, but most will not. The biosphere may become quite different.

These are only a few of the impacts warmer temperatures will have. The
vast majority of scientists agree that this is what is happening.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-y8y}

-   Global temperatures will increase. Some locations like the Arctic
    and Amazon will experience a greater increase.
-   Sea level will rise and some coastal cities may be submerged.
-   Weather will become more extreme. Crops and some plants and animals
    may not be able to survive the warmer temperatures.

**What can the polar bear do?**

Polar bears evolved to hunt from ice. As arctic ice melts, polar bears
are having a harder time finding food. Polar bears can adapt to finding
food in other locations, like garbage dumps. But they can't do anything
about reducing global warming. Humans create greenhouse gas emissions,
and so humans can reduce those emissions. It's not too soon to get
started.

### Climate Regulations {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZSBSZWd1bGF0aW9ucw.._31-uyf}

The Clean Air Act of 1970 was crucial for reducing air pollution in the
United States. The Clean Water Act of 1970 did the same for reducing
water pollution. The Montreal Protocol was even more important in some
ways. This treaty was the first time many countries came together to
solve a problem. They created a good plan for reducing substances that
destroy the ozone layer.

A treaty similar to the Montreal Protocol is needed for regulating
greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol was passed in 1997. The Protocol
focused on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Many nations signed the
protocol, but not all. The United States, which at the time was the
largest emitter of greenhouse gases, did not. The U.S. is currently the
second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. Other treaties
have been worked on but there has not been much progress. There are many
people, organizations and nations that think that this is too vague and
too slow.

A stricter agreement must be reached very soon. By doing nothing we are
doing something—continuing to raise greenhouse gas levels and failing to
prepare for the coming environmental changes. Efforts to limit
greenhouse gas emissions are mired in politics. Meanwhile, crucial time
is being lost.

### Ways to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions {#9.html#x-ck12-V2F5cyB0byBSZWR1Y2UgQ2FyYm9uIERpb3hpZGUgRW1pc3Npb25z_31-n0s}

There are several possible ways to encourage organizations to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions. They include cap-and-trade systems, carbon
taxes, and carbon sequestration.

-   In a **cap-and-trade system** , each nation is given a cap on carbon
    dioxide emissions. This is the most carbon dioxide the country is
    allowed to emit. Sometimes a nation may need to go over its cap. In
    that case, it can trade with another nation that is below its cap.
    Below, you can see how this works ( **Figure**
    [below](#9.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DYXBBbmRUcmFkZQ..) ).
-   **Carbon taxes** are taxes placed on products that produce
    carbon dioxide. An example of this is gasoline for your car. The
    taxes encourage people to use less fossil fuel. This naturally
    reduces carbon dioxide emissions.
-   **Carbon sequestration** captures carbon dioxide as it is emitted by
    a power plant before it enters the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is
    then stored in another form. Carbon is sequestered naturally
    by forests. Trees take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
    Artificial methods of sequestering carbon underground are
    being researched. This is just one of the geoengineering methods
    that are being researched for reducing carbon dioxide.

This diagram shows how a cap-and-trade system works.

New technologies can be developed. Renewable energy sources emit fewer
or no greenhouse gases. These sources are discussed in the chapter
*Natural Resources* .

### What You Can Do {#9.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBZb3UgQ2FuIERv_31-kjj}

Reducing the amount that temperatures will rise will take all nations
working together. But individuals can make a difference. What can you
do? Many of the same things that you do to reduce air pollution.

-   Walk, ride a bike, or take a bus.
-   Turn electrical appliances off.
-   Reduce consumption of products and packaging.
-   Unplug cell phones and other chargers when not in use.
-   Use compact fluorescent light bulbs.
-   Use directed lighting.
-   Be aware: take shorter showers, do not use more boiling water than
    needed, etc.
-   BE INVOLVED! Learn more about climate change. Talk with people about
    the problem and what they can do. Write letters to the editor or
    to politicians. It's your world and your future.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._31-h8p}

-   A cap-and-trade system gives nations a cap on the greenhouse
    gas emissions. Those that have a higher cap than they need can trade
    with a nation that needs more.
-   A carbon tax taxes carbon emissions to encourage conservation.
-   Carbon capture and sequestration is a geoengineering solution. This
    method removes excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
    stores it.

## Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-rdr}

Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and
direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many
states have the joke, "if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes
and it will change." One way to change the weather is to have a
different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses
bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes
form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring
about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather.
Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due
in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average
of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position
relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent,
altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the
same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a
climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed
throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the
Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the
Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few
decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse
gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of
forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are
already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce
emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in

**Why don't these mountains look the same?**

The same plate tectonics processes caused both sets of mountains to
rise. In both cases, two continental plates smashed together at a
convergent plate boundary. The Himalaya Mountains on the left are still
uplifting. The landscape is steep and rugged. The photo on the right
shows the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains were once steep like
the Himalaya. If the only processes on Earth were plate tectonics
processes, the Appalachians might still look like the Himalaya. But the
Appalachian Mountains are low and rounded. Over time the Appalachians
have undergone weathering and erosion. This chapter is about the
processes that modify the landscape. These processes alter landforms.
Some of these processes create new landforms.

**Why are these rocks different?**

The rock seen on the left is being mined in a quarry. What are the
features of the rock? The rock seen on the right is exposed in an
outcrop. How do the features of these rocks differ? The rock in the
quarry is being exposed to the elements for the first time. It is not
weathered. The rock in the outcrop has been weathering for many
thousands of years. Can you identify the weathering features?

### Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-V2VhdGhlcmluZw..-xfh}

**Weathering** changes solid rock into pieces. These pieces are called
sediments. Sediments are described in the chapter *Earth's Materials and
Crust* . Sediments are different sizes of rock particles. Boulders are
sediments; so is gravel. At the other end, silt and clay are also
sediments. Weathering may also cause the minerals at the Earth’s surface
to change form. The new minerals that form are stable at the Earth’s
surface. There are two types of weathering, mechanical and chemical.
These are discussed in the next two concepts.

#### Weathering Takes Time {#10.html#x-ck12-V2VhdGhlcmluZyBUYWtlcyBUaW1l-1ho}

No one can watch for millions of years as mountains are built. And no
one can watch as those same mountains gradually are worn away. But
imagine a new sidewalk or road. The new road is smooth and even. Over
hundreds of years, it will completely disappear. What happens to that
road over one or two years? What changes would you see ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Qb3Rob2xl) )? What forces of
weathering wear down that road, or rocks or mountains over time?

**Figure 10.1**

One bad winter can cause a road to weather. The potholes in this road
will need to be fixed.

</div>

### Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbg..-hoz}

**Erosion** moves sediments after they have formed. The sediments are
transported away from the place where they form. There are several
agents of erosion. Flowing water moves and deposits sediments. Water
erodes far more material than any other erosional agent. Wind is
important as an agent of erosion. This is especially true in arid
climates. Ice, in glaciers, can erode enormous quantities of sediments.
Gravity as a force of erosion pulls material downhill.

Many types of landforms are created by the erosion of sediments. Some
are described later in this chapter.

### Deposition {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVwb3NpdGlvbg..-mvh}

Sediments are deposited in an environment of deposition. This can be a
sand dune, beach, lake, river bend, or a great number of other
locations. Scientists can figure out the environment of deposition of a
sedimentary rock by looking at the size of sediments and the sedimentary
features in the rock.

Many types of landforms are created by the deposition of sediments. Some
are described later in this chapter.

### Changing Landscapes {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhbmdpbmcgTGFuZHNjYXBlcw..-i36}

Plate tectonics forces work to build huge mountains and other
landscapes. Conversely, the forces of weathering gradually wear down
those rocks and landscapes. Together with erosion, tall mountains turn
into hills and even plains. The Appalachian Mountains along the east
coast of North America were once as tall as the Himalayas.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-szx}

-   Weathering breaks down Earth's materials into smaller pieces.
-   Erosion transports those pieces to other locations.
-   Weathering and erosion modify Earth's surface landscapes over time.

**Why is mechanical weathering so important here?**

The high mountains of the Sierra Nevada are made of granite. The climate
is cold. Mechanical weathering dominates the weathering here. Can you
find signs of mechanical weathering in the photo? Can you see evidence
of chemical weathering in the photo? Why is mechanical weathering so
much more important than chemical weathering here? How is mechanical
weathering altering the landscape in the high Sierra?

### Mechanical Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBXZWF0aGVyaW5n_1-axt}

**Mechanical weathering** breaks rock into smaller pieces. These smaller
pieces are just like the bigger rock; they're just smaller! The rock has
broken without changing its composition. The smaller pieces have the
same minerals in the same proportions. You could use the expression “a
chip off the old block“ to describe mechanical weathering! The main
agents of mechanical weathering are water, ice, and wind.

#### Ice Wedging {#10.html#x-ck12-SWNlIFdlZGdpbmc._1-vo2}

Rocks can break apart into smaller pieces in many ways. **Ice wedging**
is common where water goes above and below its freezing point (
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JY2VXZWRnaW5n) ). This can
happen in winter in the mid-latitudes or in colder climates in summer.
Ice wedging is common in mountainous regions like the Sierra Nevada
pictured above.

wedging](ck12_10_files/20150911025919099050.jpeg "Diagram showing ice wedging")

**Figure 10.2**

Diagram showing ice wedging.

</div>

This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice,
it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with
water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in
the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of
soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the
can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or
pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances
get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.)

Ice wedging happens because water expands as it goes from liquid to
solid. When the temperature is warm, water works its way into cracks in
rock. When the temperature cools below freezing, the water turns to ice
and expands. The ice takes up more space. Over time, this wedges the
rock apart. Ice wedging is very effective at weathering. You can find
large piles of broken rock at the base of a slope. These rocks were
broken up by ice wedging. Once loose, they tumbled down the slope.

#### Abrasion {#10.html#x-ck12-QWJyYXNpb24._1-svn}

**Abrasion** is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion,
one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock
tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion; it moves rocks so
that they bump against one another ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XZXRQZWJibGVz) ). Strong winds cause
abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the ice in
glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of
a glacier scrape against the rock below. If you have ever collected
beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of
abrasion.

**Figure 10.3**

Water flowing through river or beach cobbles causes them to hit each
other. This contact causes abrasion, which makes the rocks round.

#### Plants and Animals in Mechanical Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnRzIGFuZCBBbmltYWxzIGluIE1lY2hhbmljYWwgV2VhdGhlcmluZw.._1-xbl}

Sometimes plants or animals cause mechanical weathering. This can happen
slowly. A plant’s roots grow into a crack in rock. As the roots grow
larger, they wedge open the crack ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UcmVlUm9vdFdlYXRoZXJpbmc.) ).
Burrowing animals can also cause weathering. By digging for food or
creating a hole to live, in the animal may break apart rock.

weathering.

#### Humans and Mechanical Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW5zIGFuZCBNZWNoYW5pY2FsIFdlYXRoZXJpbmc._1-qot}

Today, human beings do a lot of mechanical weathering whenever we dig or
blast into rock. This is common when we build homes, roads, and subways,
or quarry stone for construction or other uses.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-fmt}

-   Mechanical weathering breaks down existing rocks and minerals.
-   Mechanical weathering keeps the chemical makeup of materials
    the same.
-   Ice wedging, abrasion, and some actions of living organisms and
    humans bring about mechanical weathering.

**Why is the rock different colors on the surface and in the interior?**

This rock is at South Mountain Park in the Phoenix metropolitan area.
The climate is often hot and arid. What colors are the rock in this
photo? What color is the surface of the rock? What color is the
interior? Why do you think there are differences in color between the
surface and the interior of this rock? How is chemical weathering
altering the landscape?

### Chemical Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgV2VhdGhlcmluZw.._2-zjr}

**Chemical weathering** is different than mechanical weathering. The
minerals in the rock change their chemical makeup. They become a
different type of mineral or even a different type of rock. Chemical
weathering works through chemical reactions that change the rock.

#### No Longer Stable {#10.html#x-ck12-Tm8gTG9uZ2VyIFN0YWJsZQ.._2-kac}

Most minerals form deep within Earth's crust. At these depths,
temperatures and pressures are much higher than at the surface. Minerals
that were stable deeper in the crust are not stable under surface
conditions. That’s why chemical weathering happens. Minerals that formed
at higher temperature and pressure change into minerals that are stable
at the surface.

#### Agents of Chemical Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-QWdlbnRzIG9mIENoZW1pY2FsIFdlYXRoZXJpbmc._2-sj8}

There are many agents of chemical weathering. Remember that water was a
main agent of mechanical weathering. Well, water is also an agent of
chemical weathering. That makes it a double agent! Carbon dioxide and
oxygen are also agents of chemical weathering. Each of these is
discussed below.

#### Water {#10.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXI._2-xeo}

Water is an amazing molecule. It has a very simple chemical formula, H
~2~ O. It is made of just two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.
Water is remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Lots of things
dissolve easily in water. Some types of rock can even completely
dissolve in water ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1XYWxudXRDYW55b24y) )! Other minerals
change by adding water into their structure. **Hydrolysis** is the name
of the chemical reaction between a compound and water.

</div>

#### Carbon Dioxide {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uIERpb3hpZGU._2-wkq}

Carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) combines with water as raindrops fall through
the air. This makes a weak acid, called carbonic acid. This happens so
often that carbonic acid is a common, weak acid found in nature. This
acid works to dissolve rock. It eats away at sculptures and monuments.
While this is normal, more acids are made when we add pollutants to the
air. Any time we burn any fossil fuel, it adds nitrous oxide to the air.
When we burn coal, rich in sulfur, it adds sulfur dioxide to the air. As
nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide react with water, they form nitric acid
and sulfuric acid. These are the two main components of acid rain. Acid
rain accelerates chemical weathering.

#### Oxygen {#10.html#x-ck12-T3h5Z2Vu_2-ogf}

Oxygen strongly reacts with elements at the Earth’s surface. This
process is called **oxidation** . You are probably most familiar with
the rust that forms when iron reacts with oxygen. Many minerals are rich
in iron. Red rocks are full of iron oxides ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Nb251bWVudFZhbGxleQ..) ). As iron
changes into iron oxide, the iron oxides can also make red color in
soils.

#### Plants and Animals {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnRzIGFuZCBBbmltYWxz_2-amy}

Plants and animals also cause chemical weathering. As plant roots take
in nutrients, they remove elements from the minerals. This causes a
chemical change in the rock.

#### Mechanical Weathering and Chemical Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBXZWF0aGVyaW5nIGFuZCBDaGVtaWNhbCBXZWF0aGVyaW5n_2-hjb}

Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock
breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases.
With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical
weathering to occur ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-V2VhLTA5MDEtMDM.) ). Let’s say you wanted to
make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big
chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you
could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips,
but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the
smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces
dissolve more easily.

**How is weathering different in these two places?**

Weathering varies for a lot of reasons. If you compare these two photos,
one reason stands out. On the left, there is a lot of plant life. On the
right, not so much. Why is the amount of plant life so different? The
left is a rainforest, with a warm and wet climate. The right is a
desert, with a warm and dry climate. Climate is very important for
causing weathering. The way a landscape is modified depends on the
climate of the region and other factors.

### Rock and Mineral Type {#10.html#x-ck12-Um9jayBhbmQgTWluZXJhbCBUeXBl_3-y0w}

Some types of minerals weather easily. Some types of minerals are very
resistant to weathering. Some minerals in a rock might completely
dissolve in water. This leaves behind the more resistant minerals, which
are released from the rock. A beautiful example of this effect is the
"Stone Forest" in China, shown in the video below:

-   **Stone Forest** at
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln5K3\_8Cxrc](watch?v=Ln5K3_8Cxrc) (3:18)

Rocks also weather differently. Igneous rocks are usually solid and are
more resistant to weathering. Intrusive igneous rocks weather slowly
because it is hard for water to penetrate them. Sedimentary rocks
usually weather more easily. For example, limestone dissolves in weak
acids like rainwater.

Different types of sedimentary rocks can weather differently. This will
lead to differential erosion. In the photo of the Grand Canyon, some
layers create cliffs. These are hard rocks that do not weather easily.
Rock layers that resist weathering and erosion form the top of the
canyon and the top of features. Softer layers form slopes. These are
rocks that weather more easily ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmFuZENhbnlvbg..) ).

### Climate {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZQ.._3-ezl}

**Climate** is the temperature plus precipitation of an area. Not just
today, but over a long period of time. Climate affects chemical
weathering. Chemical weathering increases as:

-   Temperature increases. Chemical reactions are faster at
    higher temperatures.
-   Precipitation increases. Chemical reactions increase when there is
    more water. Since water increases both mechanical and chemical
    weathering, more water strongly increases weathering.

Look at how temperature and precipitation change weathering. What type
of climate has the lowest weathering rate? A cold, dry climate. A warm,
wet climate has the highest weathering rate.

#### Vegetation {#10.html#x-ck12-VmVnZXRhdGlvbg.._3-x3z}

Plants increase mechanical and chemical weathering. Plant roots may
enter cracks in rock and break it apart. Plant debris may increase the
amount of acid in water. The warmer and wetter a climate is, the more
plants it will have. Bacteria also grow more in warm, wet regions. So,
warm, wet climates have more weathering from biological processes.

### Resources from Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-UmVzb3VyY2VzIGZyb20gV2VhdGhlcmluZw.._3-c6e}

Weathering may concentrate some resources. In tropical climates,
chemical weathering can be intense. Some minerals dissolve and water
carries them away. This leaves behind the materials that are not
soluble. **Bauxite** is aluminum oxide that collects this way. Bauxite
is our main source of aluminum ore.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-jz2}

-   Different minerals and rocks weather at different rates under the
    same conditions.
-   Different temperature and precipitation will cause the same
    materials to weather differently.
-   Vegetation increases weathering, both mechanical and chemical.

**How does soil resemble weathered rock?**

The same processes that weather rock create soil. A large part of soil
is weathered rock! If weathering processes didn't exist on earth we
would have no soil. Earth wouldn't be a very good place to live. There
would be very limited plant life and not much way to grow crops.

### The Importance of Soil {#10.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEltcG9ydGFuY2Ugb2YgU29pbA.._4-q47}

You learned in the previous concept that weathering produces sediment.
Weathering also produces soil.

People could not live on earth without soil! Your life and the lives of
many land organisms depend on soil. **Soil** is only a very thin layer
over solid rock. Yet, it is the place where reactions between solid
rock, liquid water and air take place. Soil anchors plant roots and
provides them with water and nutrients. We get wood, paper, cotton,
medicines, and even pure water from soil. So soil is a very important
resource. Our precious soil needs to be carefully managed and cared for.
If we don’t take care of the soil we have, we may not be able to use it
in the future.

### Characteristics of Soil {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFNvaWw._4-0nr}

Soil is a complex mixture of different materials.

-   Some of them are **inorganic** . Inorganic materials are made from
    non-living substances like pebbles and sand.
-   Soil also contains bits of **organic** materials from plants
    and animals.

In general, about half of the soil is made of pieces of rock and
minerals. The other half is organic materials.

In some soils, the organic portion is entirely missing. This is true of
desert sand. At the other extreme, a soil may be completely organic.
Peat, found in a bog or swamp, is totally organic soil. Organic
materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion
provides the nutrients needed for strong plant growth.

### Soil Texture {#10.html#x-ck12-U29pbCBUZXh0dXJl_4-x90}

The inorganic portion of soil is made of many different size particles.
These different size particles are present in different proportions. The
sizes and proportions of particles determines some of the properties of
the soil.

-   Water can flow easily through a **permeable** soil. Spaces between
    the inorganic particles are large and well connected. Sandy or silty
    soils are permeable, water-draining types of soils.
-   Soils with lots of very small spaces are water-holding soils. When
    clay is present in a soil, the soil holds together more tightly.
    Clay-rich soil can hold more water.
-   When a soil contains a mixture of grain sizes, the soil is called a
    **loam** ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb2lsVGV4dHVyZQ..) ).

#### Classification {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._4-37l}

Soil scientists classify soil by measuring the percentage of sand, silt,
and clay. They plot this information on a triangular diagram. Each size
particle is at one corner ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtUmV2LTktU29pbF90eXBlcw..) ). The soil
type is then known from the location on the diagram. At the top, a soil
would be clay; at the left corner, it would be sand; at the right
corner, it would be silt. Soils in the lower middle with less than 50%
clay are loams.

**How are these two soils different?**

What color is the soil on the left? What color is the soil on the right?
Why do you think they differ so much in color? Which soil do you think
is better for growing things? See below to find out!

### Soil Formation {#10.html#x-ck12-U29pbCBGb3JtYXRpb24._5-0sa}

How well soil forms and what type of soil forms depends on several
different factors, which are described below.

-   An animation of how weathering makes soil is found here:
    [http://courses.soil.ncsu.edu/resources/soil\_classification\_genesis/mineral\_weathering/mineral\_weathering.swf](mineral_weathering.swf) .

Soil development takes a very long time. It may take hundreds or even
thousands of years to form the fertile upper layer of soil. Soil
scientists estimate that in the very best soil forming conditions, soil
forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, it may take
thousands of years!

#### Weathering {#10.html#x-ck12-V2VhdGhlcmluZw.._5-n6r}

Soil formation requires weathering. Where there is less weathering,
soils are thinner. However, soluble minerals may be present. Where there
is intense weathering, soils may be thick. Minerals and nutrients would
have been washed out.

#### Climate {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZQ.._5-6zt}

Climate is the most important factor determining soil type. Given enough
time, a climate will produce a particular type of soil. The original
rock type does not matter. Two rocks of the same type will form a
different soil type in each different climate. This is true because most
rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements. When the rock breaks
down to become soil, the soil is the same.

The same climate factors that lead to high weathering also produce more
soil.

-   More rain weathers minerals and rocks more. Rain allows chemical
    reactions especially in the top layers of the soil.
-   More rain can dissolve more rock. More rain can carry away
    more material. As material is carried away, new surfaces
    are exposed. This also increases the rate of weathering.
-   Higher temperatures increase the rate of chemical reactions. This
    also increases soil formation.
-   In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster. Plants and
    animals weather material and produce soils. In tropical regions,
    where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick
    soils form. Arid regions have thin soils.

Soil type also influences the type of vegetation that can grow in the
region. We can identify climate types by the types of plants that grow
there.

#### Parent Rock {#10.html#x-ck12-UGFyZW50IFJvY2s._5-mvq}

The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil.
Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces. Chemical
reactions change the rock's minerals.

Soil may form in place or from material that has been moved.

-   **Residual soil** forms in place. The underlying rock breaks down to
    form the layers of soil above it. Only about one-third of the soils
    in the United States are residual.
-   **Transported soil** has come in from somewhere else. Sediments can
    be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity.
    Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported
    and deposited.

#### Slope {#10.html#x-ck12-U2xvcGU._5-lbn}

Weathered material washes off steep slopes and so does not stay in place
to form soil. Soil forms where land areas are flat or gently undulating.

#### Time {#10.html#x-ck12-VGltZQ.._5-vno}

Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases.
The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area,
the thicker it will be.

#### Biological Activity {#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvbG9naWNhbCBBY3Rpdml0eQ.._5-0ld}

Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. **Humus**
forms from the remains of plants and animals. It is an extremely
important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds
them together into clumps that hold the soil together. This gives the
soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water.
Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more
fertile. These soils are more easily farmed.

The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are
rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials.
Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray,
yellow, or red ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TYW5keVNvaWw.) ). Soil with low
organic material is not good for growing plants.

**Figure 10.12**

This sandy soil shows evidence of very little organic activity. Plants
grow, but are far apart and short-lived. This means that little soil can
form. The soil that's there has little organic content.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-e9j}

-   Many factors affect soil formation. Some are climate, rock type,
    slope, time, and biological activity. Differences in these factors
    may produce different types of soil.
-   Soil type determines what can grow in a region.
-   Humus is the decayed remains of living organisms. Humus makes
    soil fertile.

**What's beneath your car tires?**

Beneath an asphalt road is this incredible soil profile. Can you
identify the horizons? There are some clues in the photo that can help
you identify the climate type. What type of climate would produce this
soil?

### Soil Horizons and Profiles {#10.html#x-ck12-U29pbCBIb3Jpem9ucyBhbmQgUHJvZmlsZXM._6-fkq}

Soil develops over time and forms soil horizons. **Soil horizons** are
different layers of soil with depth. The most weathering occurs in the
top layer. This layer is most exposed to weather! It is where fresh
water comes into contact with the soil. Each layer lower is weathered
just a little bit less than the layer above. As water moves down through
the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil. This is
because the chemical reactions have already occurred.

If you dig a deep hole in the ground, you may see each of the different
layers of soil. All together, the layers are a **soil profile** . Each
horizon has its own set of characteristics ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb2lsUHJvZmlsZVJlZHV4) ). In the
simplest soil profile, a soil has three horizons.

</div>

#### Topsoil {#10.html#x-ck12-VG9wc29pbA.._6-rxo}

The first horizon is the “A“ horizon. It is more commonly called the
**topsoil** . The topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil. It
is the layer with the most organic material. Humus forms from all the
plant and animal debris that falls to or grows on the ground. The
topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity. Many
organisms live within this layer. Plant roots stretch down into this
layer. The roots help to hold the topsoil in place. Topsoil is needed to
grow most crops ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TYWxhZEdhcmRlbg..) ).

**Figure 10.14**

Good topsoil is great for growing plants.

</div>

Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay. Clay-sized
particles are carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the
ground. Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the
topsoil. These minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil.

#### Subsoil {#10.html#x-ck12-U3Vic29pbA.._6-rxn}

Below the topsoil is the “B“ horizon. This is also called the
**subsoil** . Soluble minerals and clays accumulate in the subsoil.
Because it has less organic material, this layer is lighter brown in
color than topsoil. It also holds more water due to the presence of iron
and clay. There is less organic material in this layer.

#### C-horizon {#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1ob3Jpem9u_6-fnt}

The next layer down is the “C” horizon. The **C horizon** is made of
partially altered bedrock. There is evidence of weathering in this
layer. Still, it is possible to identify the original rock type from
which this soil formed ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb2lsSG9yaXpvbnM.) ).

Not all climate regions develop soils. Arid regions are poor at soil
development. Not all regions develop the same soil horizons. Some areas
develop as many as five or six distinct layers. Others develop only a
few.

**Where would you rather grow crops?**

The soil on the left is in Tuscany in Italy. Tuscany is best known for
growing grapes for wine and olives for olive oil. The soil on the right
is in China. It is the soil that remained when rainforest trees were
removed. Do you know which soil would be better for crops?

### Types of Soils {#10.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgU29pbHM._7-keh}

For soil scientists, there are thousands of types of soil! Soil
scientists put soils into very specific groups with certain
characteristics. Each soil type has its own name. Let’s consider a much
simpler model, with just three types of soil. These types are based on
climate. Just remember that there are many more than just these three
types.

#### Pedalfer {#10.html#x-ck12-UGVkYWxmZXI._7-izb}

One important type of soil forms in a **deciduous forest** . In these
forests, trees lose their leaves each winter. Deciduous trees need lots
of rain — at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Deciduous forests are
common in the temperate, eastern United States. The type of soil found
in a deciduous forest is a **pedalfer** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QbG91Z2hlZEZpZWxk) ). This type of
soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile.

**Figure 10.16**

The soil beneath a deciduous forest is a pedalfer. These soils are very
fertile.

</div>

#### Pedocal {#10.html#x-ck12-UGVkb2NhbA.._7-qpy}

**Pedocal** soil forms where grasses and brush are common ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QZWRvY2Fs) ). The climate is drier,
with less than 65 cm of rain per year. With less rain, there is less
chemical weathering, there is less organic material, and the soils are
slightly less fertile.

Grassland soils are less rich than soils in more humid regions.

</div>

#### Laterite {#10.html#x-ck12-TGF0ZXJpdGU._7-qts}

A third important type of soil is **laterite** . Laterite forms in
tropical areas. Temperatures are warm and rain falls every day (
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1MYXRlcml0ZQ..) ). So much
rain falls that chemical weathering is intense. All soluble minerals are
washed from the soil. Plant nutrients get carried away. There is
practically no humus. Laterite soils are often red in color from the
iron oxides. If laterites are exposed to the Sun, they bake as hard as a
brick.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-d5z}

-   Pedalfer is the soil common in deciduous forests. Pedalfer is dark
    brown and fertile.
-   Pedocal is the soil common in grasslands. The more arid climate
    increases calcium in the soil. Pedocal is not as fertile.
-   Laterite forms in tropical rain forests. Chemical weathering strips
    the soils of their nutrients. When the forest is removed the soil is
    not very fertile.

**Could it happen again?**

Farmers were forced off their lands during the **Dust Bowl** in the
1930s. The rains stopped, and the topsoil blew off these former
grasslands. This scene was repeated throughout the central United
States. During long droughts, some people wonder if another dust bowl
could come.

### Causes of Soil Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIFNvaWwgRXJvc2lvbg.._8-xjp}

The same agents that erode landscapes also erode soil. They are water,
wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the leading cause of soil
erosion. Water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a
leading cause of soil erosion. Wind can pick up soil and blow it far
away.

Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the
ground to dry are activities that increase erosion. What are some human
activities that increase soil erosion?

#### Farming {#10.html#x-ck12-RmFybWluZw.._8-s4u}

The photos below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMDItQ3JvcHMtZW5kYW5nZXItc29pbA..) )
show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots
penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare
soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and
water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting.

The problem doesn’t stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows
with bare soil in between the rows. In places where crops grow only
during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months.

The soil that is most likely to erode is the nutrient-rich topsoil. The
loss of topsoil degrades the farmland.

#### Grazing {#10.html#x-ck12-R3JhemluZw.._8-ect}

As pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMDMtU2hlZXAtYW5kLWdvYXRz) ), some
grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the
roots. They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground. Grazing
animals can kill the grass. They may thin it out so much that it offers
little protection to the soil. If animals are kept in the same place too
long, the soil may become completely bare. The bare soil is easily
eroded by wind and water.

#### Logging, Mining and Construction {#10.html#x-ck12-TG9nZ2luZywgTWluaW5nIGFuZCBDb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24._8-9pu}

Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and
construction. You can see examples of each below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMDQtTG9nZ2luZy1taW5pbmctY29uc3RydWN0aW9u)
).

-   When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind
    and rain. Without trees, there is no **leaf litter** to cover the
    ground and protect the soil. When leaf litter decays, it adds humus
    and nutrients to the soil.
-   Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the
    land bare.
-   Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into
    the ground. This increases runoff and the potential for
    soil erosion.

**Figure 10.22**

What’s fun for people may be bad for soil. Off-road vehicles can destroy
plants and leave the ground bare. This sets up the soil for erosion.

</div>

Soil erosion is a natural occurrence. However, human activities have
greatly accelerated soil erosion. In some locations, soil may now be
eroding about 10 times faster than its natural rate. Since Europeans
settled in the United States, approximately one-third of the topsoil has
eroded away.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-orh}

-   Soil erosion is a natural process, but human activities can
    increase it.
-   The main agents of soil erosion are water and wind.
-   Soil erosion is more likely where the ground has been disturbed.
    Farming, grazing animals, logging, mining, construction, and
    recreational activities can do this.

**Why did someone cut designs into this hillside?**

Although the hillside is interesting, that's not why this was done.
Terracing prevents soil erosion on a hillside that is being farmed. Many
techniques can be utilized to reduce soil erosion.

### Preventing Soil Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBTb2lsIEVyb3Npb24._9-qk8}

Soil is a renewable resource, but it can take thousands of years to
form. That’s why people need to do what they can to prevent soil
erosion.

#### Farming Methods that Reduce Soil Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-RmFybWluZyBNZXRob2RzIHRoYXQgUmVkdWNlIFNvaWwgRXJvc2lvbg.._9-gkp}

The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and
growing crops. New ways of farming were developed to protect the soil.
Some of the methods are described below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMDYtRmFybWluZy1yZWR1Y2Utc29pbC1sb3Nz)

#### Other Ways to Reduce Soil Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgV2F5cyB0byBSZWR1Y2UgU29pbCBFcm9zaW9u_9-rkd}

There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMDctUHJvdGVjdGluZy1zb2ls) ).

-   Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from field to field.
    This gives the grass a chance to recover.
-   Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any
    given place. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down.
-   Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to
    the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to
    protect the bare soil.
-   Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at
    construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place.
-   Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff.
-   Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-j79}

-   Soil is a renewable resource. Sometimes it is lost faster than it
    can be replaced.
-   Farming methods that can reduce soil erosion include terracing,
    contour cropping, windbreaks, and no-till planting.
-   Caution with grazing, recreational activities and reclaiming used
    lands can help reduce soil erosion.

**What's different about these landscapes?**

Both of these rivers run through Yellowstone National Park. The Firehole
River is a tributary of the Madison. In this photo, it's flowing over
flat ground. The Yellowstone River on the right is cascading over
Yellowstone Falls. Which river is doing more erosion? In what direction
is the stream eroding?

### Erosion by Surface Water {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBieSBTdXJmYWNlIFdhdGVy_10-zyt}

Water that flows over Earth’s surface includes runoff, streams, and
rivers. All these types of flowing water can cause erosion and
deposition.

#### Erosion by Runoff {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBieSBSdW5vZmY._10-gzv}

When a lot of rain falls in a short period of time, much of the water is
unable to soak into the ground. Instead, it runs over the land. Gravity
causes the water to flow from higher to lower ground. As the runoff
flows, it may pick up loose bits of soil and sand.

Runoff causes more erosion if the land is bare. Plants help hold the
soil in place. The runoff water pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TaGVldEVyb3Npb24.) ) is brown because
it eroded soil from a bare, sloping field. Can you find evidence of
erosion by runoff where you live? What should you look for?

**Figure 10.25**

Runoff has eroded small channels through this bare field.

</div>

Much of the material eroded by runoff is carried into bodies of water,
such as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, or oceans. Runoff is an important
cause of erosion. That’s because it occurs over so much of Earth’s
surface.

#### Erosion by Streams {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBieSBTdHJlYW1z_10-nue}

Streams erode sediment from their banks. They pick up and transport
sediments.

![A stream in the desert erodes the cliff
face](ck12_10_files/20150911025924035214.jpeg "A stream in the desert erodes the cliff face")

**Figure 10.26**

A stream in the desert rushes past its banks. The power of the water
erodes the cliff face.

</div>

As a stream erodes its banks, it creates a V-shaped valley ( **Figure**
[above](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Fcm9kZWRDbGlmZkZhY2U.) ). This
contrasts with the U-shaped valleys created by glaciers.

#### Erosion and Water Speed {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBhbmQgV2F0ZXIgU3BlZWQ._10-mha}

Erosion by a stream depends on the velocity of the water. Fast water
erodes more material than slow water. Eventually, the water deposits the
materials. As water slows, larger particles are deposited first. As the
water slows even more, smaller particles are deposited. The graph
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1IanVsc3Ryb21EaWFncmFt) ) shows how
water velocity and particle size influence erosion and deposition.

**Figure 10.27**

Flowing water erodes or deposits particles depending on how fast the
water is moving. It also depends on how big the particles are.

</div>

#### Erosion in the Mountains {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBpbiB0aGUgTW91bnRhaW5z_10-dcr}

Streams often start in mountains, where the land is very steep (
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTAtMDQtbW91bnRhaW4tc3RyZWFt)
). A mountain stream flows very quickly because of the steep slope. This
causes a lot of erosion and very little deposition. The rapidly falling
water digs down into the stream bed and makes it deeper. It carves a
narrow, V-shaped channel.

**Figure 10.28**

This mountain stream is in Whitney Portal in the Sierra Nevada of
California. The slope is so steep that water cascades down in a
waterfall.

</div>

#### How a Waterfall Forms {#10.html#x-ck12-SG93IGEgV2F0ZXJmYWxsIEZvcm1z_10-sv3}

Mountain streams may erode waterfalls. A waterfall forms where a stream
flows from an area of harder to softer rock ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1XYXRlcmZhbGxGb3JtYXRpb24.) ). The
water erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock. This causes
the stream bed to drop down, like a step. This creates a waterfall. As
erosion continues, the waterfall gradually moves upstream.

#### Erosion by Slow-Flowing Rivers {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBieSBTbG93LUZsb3dpbmcgUml2ZXJz_10-har}

Streams eventually run onto flatter ground. Rivers flowing over gentle
slopes erode the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Large
curves, called **meanders** , form because of erosion and deposition by
the moving water. The curves are called meanders because they slowly
“wander,” or meander, over the land. Below, you can see how this happens
( **Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NZWFuZGVyRm9ybWF0aW9u)
).

**Figure 10.30**

Meanders form because water erodes the outside of curves and deposits
eroded material on the inside. Over time, the curves shift position.

</div>

As meanders erode from side to side, they create a **floodplain** . This
is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander
may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an **oxbow
lake** ( **Figure**

Sediments are carried as:

-   **Dissolved load** : Dissolved ions are carried in the water. These
    ions usually travel all the way to the ocean.
-   **Suspended load** : Sediments carried as solids as the stream flows
    are suspended load. The size of particles that can be carried is
    determined by the stream’s velocity ( **Figure**

The Connecticut River is brown from the sediment it carries. The river

</div>

-   **Bed load** : Some particles are too large to be carried as
    suspended load. These sediments are bumped and pushed along the
    stream bed as bed load. Bed load sediments do not move continuously.
    This intermittent movement is called **saltation** . Streams with
    high velocities that flow down steep slopes cut down into the
    stream bed. The sediments that travel as bed load do a lot of
    the downcutting.

<!-- -->

    [http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20files/bdld.mov](bdld.mov) .

### Deposition by Streams and Rivers {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVwb3NpdGlvbiBieSBTdHJlYW1zIGFuZCBSaXZlcnM._11-bno}

When a stream or river slows down, it starts dropping its sediments.
Larger sediments are dropped in steep areas, but smaller sediments can
still be carried. Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes
less steep.

#### Alluvial Fans {#10.html#x-ck12-QWxsdXZpYWwgRmFucw.._11-wbl}

In arid regions, a mountain stream may flow onto flatter land. The
stream comes to a stop rapidly. The deposits form an **alluvial fan** (

#### Deltas {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVsdGFz_11-a1f}

Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body
of still water. In this case, a **delta** forms. A delta is shaped like
a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. An example is
pictured below ( **Figure**
[above](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbGx1dmlhbEZhbkFuZERlbHRh) ).

#### Deposition by Flood Waters {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVwb3NpdGlvbiBieSBGbG9vZCBXYXRlcnM._11-sfx}

A flood occurs when a river overflows it banks. This might happen
because of heavy rains.

#### Floodplains {#10.html#x-ck12-Rmxvb2RwbGFpbnM._11-ak5}

As the water spreads out over the land, it slows down and drops its
sediment. If a river floods often, the floodplain develops a thick layer
of rich soil because of all the deposits. That’s why floodplains are
usually good places for growing plants. For example, the Nile River in
Egypt provides both water and thick sediments for raising crops in the
middle of a sandy desert.

#### Natural Levees {#10.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBMZXZlZXM._11-yud}

A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A **levee**
( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTAtMDgtbGV2ZWUtZm9ybWF0aW9u) ) is a
raised strip of sediments deposited close to the water’s edge. Levees
occur because floodwaters deposit their biggest sediments first when
they overflow the river’s banks.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-cmz}

-   Streams carry dissolved ions and sediments. The sizes of the
    sediments a stream can carry, its competence, depend on the
    stream's velocity.
-   Particles that are too large to be suspended move along the stream
    bed by saltation.
-   Rivers deposit sediments on levees, floodplains, and in deltas and
    alluvial fans.

**What resources does a coastal city need?**

Tulum is a walled city that was once inhabited by the Maya people. Tulum
is on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. The beautiful blue Caribbean
supplied the Maya with abundant fish. What else would the Maya people
have needed? Fresh water is found in cenotes, sinkholes that are common
in the Yucatan limestone.

### Groundwater Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-R3JvdW5kd2F0ZXIgRXJvc2lvbg.._12-haf}

Some water soaks into the ground. It travels down through tiny holes in
soil. It seeps through cracks in rock. The water moves slowly, pulled
deeper and deeper by gravity. Water in an underground rock or sediment
layer is **groundwater** . Underground water can also erode and deposit
material.

Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) as it falls. The CO ~2~
combines with water to form carbonic acid. The slightly acidic water is
especially good at dissolving the rock limestone. Groundwater creates
landforms by dissolving away rock.

Florida is unique for groundwater erosion. The state is extremely flat
and is made mostly of limestone. Due to the wet climate, groundwater
surfaces in many locations. In the Everglades, rivers create a wide
floodplain and groundwater comes to the surface ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FdmVyZ2xhZGVzTlA.) ).

#### Caves {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2F2ZXM._12-zum}

Caves are one of the types of landforms created by groundwater erosion.
Working slowly over many years, groundwater travels along small cracks.
The water dissolves and carries away the solid rock. This gradually
enlarges the cracks. Eventually, a cave, like the one pictured in the
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1DYXZl) , may form.

.

#### Sinkholes {#10.html#x-ck12-U2lua2hvbGVz_12-r9z}

As erosion by groundwater continues, the ceiling of a cave may collapse.
The rock and soil above it sink into the ground. This forms a
**sinkhole** on the surface. Some sinkholes are large enough to swallow
up a home or several homes in a neighborhood.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-3h9}

-   Groundwater erodes rock beneath the ground surface. Limestone is a
    carbonate and is most easily eroded.
-   Groundwater dissolves minerals and carries the ions in solution.
-   Groundwater erosion creates caves and sinkholes.

**Where would you look for a spectacular cave like this one?**

Groundwater dissolves minerals and rocks into ions. Groundwater deposits
those ions into different types of structures. Limestone caves are the
best place to see these structures. Water erodes the cave and it has
deposits structures like stalactites and stalagmites. The cave pictured
here is Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico.

### Cave Deposits {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2F2ZSBEZXBvc2l0cw.._13-gbl}

Caves are known for their spectacular mineral structures. Caves are
likely to be found in limestone where the groundwater level has gone
down. This exposes the cave and its features. **Stalactites** are
beautiful icicle-like formations. They form as water containing calcium
carbonate drips from the ceiling of a cave. The word "stalactite" has a
"c," and it forms from the ceiling. **Stalagmites** form as calcium
carbonate drips from the ceiling to the floor of a cave. The stalagmite
grow upward. The "g" in "stalagmite" means it forms on the ground. You
can see examples of both stalactites and stalagmites below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdGFsYWN0aXRlcw..) ).

**Is this erosion or deposition?**

The power of the ocean modifies landforms by erosion and deposition.
Landforms modified by both erosion and deposition are seen in this
photo. The cliff is being eroded by incoming waves. The beach is being
created as sand is being deposited.

### Wave Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZSBFcm9zaW9u_14-pae}

Wave energy does the work of erosion at the shore. Waves erode sediments
from cliffs and shorelines. The sediment in ocean water acts like
sandpaper. Over time, they erode the shore. The bigger the waves are and
the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmVla0NsaWZmcw..) ).

**Figure 10.39**

Waves erode sediment from sea cliffs. The sediment is then deposited on
beaches. These sandy cliffs are in Greece.

</div>

Wave refraction either concentrates wave energy or disperses it. In
quiet water areas, such as bays, wave energy is dispersed. This allows
sand to be deposited. Land that sticks out into the water is eroded by
the strong wave energy. The wave energy concentrates its power on the
**wave-cut cliff** .

#### Landforms From Wave Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-TGFuZGZvcm1zIEZyb20gV2F2ZSBFcm9zaW9u_14-yc6}

Erosion by waves can create unique landforms ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb3V0aFdhbGVzQ2xpZmZz) ).

-   **Wave-cut cliffs** form when waves erode a rocky shoreline. They
    create a vertical wall of exposed rock layers.
-   **Wave-cut platforms** are level areas formed by wave erosion. Since
    these platforms are above sea level, it means that either sea level
    was higher relative or the rock was lower.

### Sediment Transport {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VkaW1lbnQgVHJhbnNwb3J0_14-mtw}

Rivers carry sediments from the land to the sea. Sometimes the sediments
are deposited in a delta. But if the waves are powerful, the water will
transport the sediments along the coastline. Sediments eroded from
cliffs near the shoreline may also be transported.

#### Wave Refraction {#10.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZSBSZWZyYWN0aW9u_14-0hb}

Most waves approach the shore at an angle. The part of the wave that is
nearer the shore reaches shallow water sooner than the part that is
farther out. The shallow part of the wave "feels" the bottom first. This
slows down the inshore part of the wave and makes the wave "bend." This
bending is called **refraction** .

-   In this animation, notice how the wave refracts as it comes into
    the beach.
    [http://www.grossmont.edu/garyjacobson/Oceanography%20112/Wave%20Model.htm](Wave%20Model.htm)

Most waves strike the shore at an angle. This creates longshore
currents, which are described in the concept "Surface Ocean Currents."

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-gvc}

-   Ocean waves have a tremendous amount of energy and so they may do a
    great deal of erosion.
-   Some landforms created by erosion are platforms, arches, and
    sea stacks.
-   Longshore currents are created because water approaches the shore at
    an angle.

**Which came first: erosion or deposition?**

Both erosion and deposition are seen in this photo. The beach sands were
deposited but waves are now eroding them away. At the shore, there's
always a battle between the two types of forces. What happens when
deposition is greater than erosion? What happens when erosion is greater
than deposition?

### Wave Deposition {#10.html#x-ck12-V2F2ZSBEZXBvc2l0aW9u_15-kad}

The transport of sediments by longshore currents is called **longshore
drift** . Longshore drift is created in this way: Sediment is moved up
the beach by an incoming wave. The wave approaches at an angle to the
shore. Water then moves straight offshore. The sediment moves straight
down the beach with it. The sediment is again picked up by a wave that
is coming in at an angle. So longshore drift moves sediment along the
shore. This zig-zag motion is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Mb25nc2hvcmVEcmlmdA..) ) and can also
be seen at the link below.

#### Landforms Deposited by Waves {#10.html#x-ck12-TGFuZGZvcm1zIERlcG9zaXRlZCBieSBXYXZlcw.._15-y7k}

Longshore drift continually moves sand along the shore. Deposition
occurs where the water motion slows. The smallest particles, such as
silt and clay, are deposited away from shore. This is where the water is
calmer. Larger particles are deposited onshore. This is where waves and
other motions are strongest.

In relatively quiet areas along a shore, waves deposit sand. Sand forms
a **beach** ( **Figure**

Manhattan Beach in Southern California has a pier coming off of a sandy

Waves also move sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand offshore
as the seasons change. In the summer, waves have lower energy so they
bring sand up onto the beach. In the winter, higher energy waves bring
the sand back offshore.

A **spit** is a ridge of sand that extends away from the shore. The end
of the spit may hook around toward the quieter waters close to shore.

Waves may also deposit sediments to form sandbars and **barrier

**Figure 10.45**

A barrier island is a long strip of sand. The sand naturally moves in
the local currents. People try to build on barrier islands.

</div>

In its natural state, a barrier island acts as the first line of defense
against storms such as hurricanes. A natural barrier island is a
vegetated sandy areas in which sand can move. When barrier islands are
developed, hurricanes damage houses and businesses. A large hurricane
brings massive problems to the urbanized area.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-owe}

-   The shore may have a lot of sediment washed from land or eroded
    from cliffs. The sediment is transported by currents.
-   Transported sand will eventually be deposited on beaches, spits, or
    barrier islands.

**Why do you see man-made structures on some beaches?**

When you go to a beach, you may see man-made structures like these. Most
attempt to keep the sand where people want the sand to be. A smaller
number keep the sand from coming into an area where it is not wanted.

### Protecting Shorelines {#10.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVjdGluZyBTaG9yZWxpbmVz_16-vxf}

Shores are attractive places to live and vacation. But development at
the shore is at risk of damage from waves. Wave erosion threatens many
homes and beaches on the ocean. This is especially true during storms,
when waves may be much larger than normal. People build several types of
structures to protect beaches.

#### Breakwaters {#10.html#x-ck12-QnJlYWt3YXRlcnM._16-r3m}

Barrier islands provide natural protection to shorelines. Storm waves
strike the barrier island before they reach the shore. People also build
artificial barriers, called **breakwaters** . Breakwaters also protect
the shoreline from incoming waves. The breakwater pictured below (
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TcGFpbkJyZWFrd2F0ZXI.) )
runs parallel to the coast like a barrier island.

Islands, Spain.

</div>

#### Groins {#10.html#x-ck12-R3JvaW5z_16-ulr}

Longshore drift can erode the sediment from a beach. To keep this from
happening, people may build a series of groins. A **groin** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HZXJtYW5Hcm9pbg..) ) is wall of rocks
or concrete. The structure juts out into the ocean perpendicular to the
shore. A groin stops the longshore movement of sand. Sand collects on
the up-current side of the groin. Sand on opposite of side of the groin
erodes. This reduces beach erosion.

#### Seawalls {#10.html#x-ck12-U2Vhd2FsbHM._16-pol}

A seawall is also parallel to the shore. However, a seawall is built
onshore. **Seawalls** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TZWF3YWxs) ) protect the shore from
incoming waves.

</div>

### Does Protection Work? {#10.html#x-ck12-RG9lcyBQcm90ZWN0aW9uIFdvcms__16-sil}

People do not always want to choose safe building practices, and instead
choose to build a beach house right on the beach. Protecting development
from wave erosion is difficult and expensive.

Protection does not always work. The northeastern coast of Japan was
protected by anti-tsunami seawalls. Yet waves from the 2011 tsunami that
resulted from the Tōhoku earthquake washed over the top of some seawalls
and caused others to collapse. Japan is now planning to build even
higher seawalls to prepare for any future (and inevitable) tsunami.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-jzy}

-   People love the shore, so they develop these regions and then must
    protect them.
-   Seawalls and breakwaters are built parallel to the shore.

**Is wind the greatest erosional force in the desert?**

Wind can do remarkable things. It can erode rock to make beautiful
shapes. Wind has eroded this rock so that it looks like a rabbit. This
limestone formation is in the Sahara Desert in Egypt. Water is the most
important erosional force even in the desert. But wind makes its mark in
many ways.

### Sediment Transport by Wind {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VkaW1lbnQgVHJhbnNwb3J0IGJ5IFdpbmQ._17-hv5}

Like flowing water, wind picks up and transports particles. Wind carries
particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them (
**Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QYXJ0aWNsZVRyYW5zcG9ydEJ5V2luZA..) ).

-   Tiny particles, such as clay and silt, move by **suspension** . They
    hang in the air, sometimes for days. They may be carried great
    distances and rise high above the ground.
-   Larger particles, such as sand, move by **saltation** . The wind
    blows them in short hops. They stay close to the ground.
-   Particles larger than sand move by **creep** . The wind rolls or
    pushes them over the surface. They stay on the ground.

### Wind Erosion {#10.html#x-ck12-V2luZCBFcm9zaW9u_17-jlb}

Dust storms ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1EdXN0U3Rvcm0.) ) are more common in
dry climates. The soil is dried out and dusty. Plants may be few and far
between. Dry, bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than
wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots.

When winds whip up in the desert, they can create tremendous dust
storms.

</div>

#### Deflation {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVmbGF0aW9u_17-phe}

Wind blows small particles away. As a result, the ground surface gets
lower and rockier; this is called **deflation** . The rocks that are
left are called **desert pavement** . Desert pavement is a surface
covered by gravel-sized particles that are not easily moved by wind.

#### Abrasion {#10.html#x-ck12-QWJyYXNpb24._17-4vj}

Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it? Sand is
blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris. Wind-blown sand
has the same effect. It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces.
Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1VdGFoV2luZEFicmFzaW9u) ). This form
of erosion is called abrasion. It occurs any time rough sediments are
blown or dragged over surfaces. Can you think of other ways abrasion
might occur?

#### Desert Varnish {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVzZXJ0IFZhcm5pc2g._17-dmy}

Exposed rocks in desert areas often develop a dark brown or black
coating called **desert varnish** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1VdGFoUGV0cm9nbHlwaA..) ). Wind
transports clay-sized particles that chemically react with other
substances at high temperatures. The coating is formed of iron and
manganese oxides.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-36v}

-   Wind moves sediments by suspension, saltation, or creep.
-   In deserts, wind picks up small particles and leaves behind
    larger rocks. This forms desert pavement.

**How does deposition by wind modify landscapes?**

On the right is a desert mountain in Arizona. The surface in the
foreground is desert pavement. How did wind modify this landscape? On
the left is a desert mountain with sand dunes in Death Valley,
California. How did wind modify this landscape? Erosion and deposition
by wind leave very different landscapes behind.

### Wind Deposition {#10.html#x-ck12-V2luZCBEZXBvc2l0aW9u_18-k2y}

Like water, when wind slows down it drops the sediment it's carrying.
This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle.
A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down. As the wind slows, it
deposits the largest particles first. Different types of deposits form
depending on the size of the particles deposited.

#### Sand Dunes {#10.html#x-ck12-U2FuZCBEdW5lcw.._18-bml}

When the wind deposits sand, it forms small hills. These hills are
called **sand dunes** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SdW5uZXJPbkR1bmVz) ). For sand dunes
to form, there must be plenty of sand and wind. Sand dunes are found
mainly in deserts and on beaches.

leaves the dune.

</div>

#### How Sand Dunes Form {#10.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNhbmQgRHVuZXMgRm9ybQ.._18-wal}

What causes a sand dune to form? It starts with an obstacle, such as a
rock. The obstacle causes the wind to slow down. The wind then drops
some of its sand. As more sand is deposited, the dune gets bigger. The
dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind. This causes more sand to
drop. The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTAtMjQtc2FuZC1kdW5lLXNoYXBl) ).

**Figure 10.54**

A sand dune has a gentle slope on the side the wind blows from. The
opposite side has a steep slope. This side is called the slip face.

</div>

#### Migration of Sand Dunes {#10.html#x-ck12-TWlncmF0aW9uIG9mIFNhbmQgRHVuZXM._18-izy}

Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land. The wind
moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune. This is
done by saltation. When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they
slip down the steeper side. The grains are pulled by gravity. The
constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move
along the ground. A dune moves in the same direction that the wind
usually blows. Can you explain why?

#### Loess {#10.html#x-ck12-TG9lc3M._18-x4v}

When the wind drops fine particles of silt and clay, it forms deposits
called **loess** ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaXNzb3VyaUxvZXNzSGlsbHM.) ). Loess
deposits form vertical cliffs. Loess can become a thick, rich soil.
That’s why loess deposits are used for farming in many parts of the
world.

#### Seafloor Mud {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VhZmxvb3IgTXVk_18-h5e}

Fine-grained mud in the deep ocean comes from silts and clays brought
from the land by wind. The particles are deposited on the sea surface.
they slowly settle to the deep ocean floor, forming brown, greenish, or
reddish clays. Volcanic ash may also settle on the seafloor.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-59s}

-   The sand is transported until it is deposited in a sand dune.
-   Sand is blown up a slope. Gravity pulls it down the other side. This
    is how dunes migrate.
-   Loess is very fine wind-blown deposits.

**In what ways is this glacier creating distinctive landforms?**

This glacier is modifying the landscape it's flowing through. Glaciers
erode and deposit telltale landforms. They show the direction a glacier
flowed and how far it advanced. They create fantastic and unique
features in mountain areas. Did glaciers leave clues where you live? If
you live in the northern part of the United States, you might be able to
find some. Would you know what to look for?

### Erosion by Glaciers {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJvc2lvbiBieSBHbGFjaWVycw.._19-el0}

Like flowing water, flowing ice erodes the land and deposits the
material elsewhere. Glaciers cause erosion in two main ways: plucking
and abrasion.

-   **Plucking** is the process by which rocks and other sediments are
    picked up by a glacier. They freeze to the bottom of the glacier and
    are carried away by the flowing ice.
-   **Abrasion** is the process in which a glacier scrapes
    underlying rock. The sediments and rocks frozen in the ice at the
    bottom and sides of a glacier act like sandpaper. They wear
    away rock. They may also leave scratches and grooves that show the
    direction the glacier moved. These grooves are called **glacial
    striations** .

#### Valley Glaciers {#10.html#x-ck12-VmFsbGV5IEdsYWNpZXJz_19-qwv}

Valley glaciers create several unique features through erosion.

-   As a valley glacier flows through a V-shaped river valley, it
    scrapes away the sides of the valley. It carves a U-shaped valley
    with nearly vertical walls ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbGFjaWVyQ29tcG9zaXRl) ).

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-mej}

-   Glaciers are incredibly powerful agents of erosion.
-   Valley glaciers create very distinctive landforms like horns,
    cirques, and hanging valleys.
-   Glaciers pluck rocks from valley walls. This turns a V-shaped river
    valley into a U-shaped glacial valley.

**How could those rocks on the glacier modify the landscape?**

Glaciers modify the landscape by erosion. They also modify the landscape
by deposition. Glaciers carry an enormous amount of material and dump
it. The features they leave behind show where they were and what
happened as they were melting away.

### Deposition by Glaciers {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVwb3NpdGlvbiBieSBHbGFjaWVycw.._20-sve}

As glaciers flow, mechanical weathering loosens rocks on the valley
walls. These rocks falls onto the glacier. Glaciers can carry rocks of
any size, from giant boulders to silt. The glacier may carry the rocks
for many kilometers over many years. Glaciers deposit the sediment when
they melt. They drop and leave behind whatever was once frozen in their
ice.

#### Erratics {#10.html#x-ck12-RXJyYXRpY3M._20-wse}

Giant rocks carried by a glacier are eventually dropped. These **glacial
erratics** , like the one pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbGFjaWFsRXJyYXRpYw..) ), are
noticeable because they are huge. Also, they are usually a different
rock type from the surrounding bedrock.

#### Glacial Till {#10.html#x-ck12-R2xhY2lhbCBUaWxs_20-yo3}

The material dropped by a glacier is usually a mixture of particles and
rocks of all sizes. This unsorted pile is called **glacial till** .
Water from the melting ice may form lakes or other water features. The
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HbGFjaWFsVGlsbA..) shows
some of the landforms glaciers deposit when they melt.

-   A **moraine** is sediment deposited by a glacier. A ground moraine
    is a thick layer of sediments left behind by a retreating glacier.
    An end moraine is a low ridge of sediments deposited at the end of
    the glacier. It marks the greatest distance the glacier advanced.

-   A **drumlin** is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by

    narrow end of each drumlin points in the direction the glacier was
    moving when it dropped the sediments.
-   An **esker** is a winding ridge of sand deposited by a stream
    of meltwater. Such streams flow underneath a retreating glacier.
-   A **kettle lake** occurs where a chunk of ice was left behind in the
    till of a retreating glacier. When the ice melted, it left
    a depression. The meltwater filled it to form a lake. You can see
    examples of kettle lakes below ( **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1LZXR0bGVMYWtlcw..) ).

#### Varves {#10.html#x-ck12-VmFydmVz_20-02e}

Several types of stratified deposits form in glacial regions but are not
formed directly by the ice. **Varves** form where lakes are covered by
ice in the winter. Dark, fine-grained clays sink to the bottom of the
lake in winter. Melting ice in the spring brings running water that
deposits lighter colored sands. Each alternating dark/light layer
represents one year of deposits.

    glacier's extent.

**What can cause devastation four months after a volcanic eruption?**

Four months after Mt. Merapi in Indonesia erupted, there is more
devastation. Rain continually washes ash downslope in massive ash flows.
Residents are unable to live well under these conditions.

### Landforms and Gravity {#10.html#x-ck12-TGFuZGZvcm1zIGFuZCBHcmF2aXR5_21-i8q}

Gravity is responsible for erosion by flowing water and glaciers. That’s
because gravity pulls water and ice downhill. These are ways gravity
causes erosion indirectly. But gravity also causes erosion directly.
Gravity can pull soil, mud, and rocks down cliffs and hillsides. This
type of erosion and deposition is called **mass wasting** . It may
happen suddenly. Or it may occur very slowly, over many years.

#### Landslides {#10.html#x-ck12-TGFuZHNsaWRlcw.._21-vq1}

**Landslides** are the most dramatic, sudden, and dangerous types of
mass wasting. Landslides are sudden falls of rock; by contrast,
avalanches are sudden falls of snow.

Weathered material may fall away from a cliff because there is nothing
to keep it in place. Rocks that fall to the base of a cliff make a
**talus slope** . Sometimes as one rock falls, it hits another rock,
which hits another rock, and begins a landslide.

A landslide can be very destructive ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ccm9rZW5CcmlkZ2U.) ). It may bury or
carry away entire villages. Air trapped under the falling rocks acts as
a cushion that keeps the rock from slowing down. Landslides can move as
fast as 200 to 300 km/hour.

</div>

Landslides often occur on steep slopes in dry or semi-arid climates. The
California coastline, with its steep cliffs and years of drought
punctuated by seasons of abundant rainfall, is prone to landslides. Wet
soil becomes slippery and heavy. Earthquakes often trigger landslides.
The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start
sliding.

-   Rapid downslope movement of material is seen in this video:
    [http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20files/dflows.mov](dflows.mov) .

#### Mudflows and Lahars {#10.html#x-ck12-TXVkZmxvd3MgYW5kIExhaGFycw.._21-vsy}

A **mudflow** is the sudden flow of mud down a slope because of gravity.
Mudflows occur where the soil is mostly clay. Like landslides, mudflows
usually occur when the soil is wet. Wet clay forms very slippery mud
that slides easily. Mudflows follow river channels, washing out bridges,
trees, and homes that are in their path.

-   A debris flow is seen in this video:
    [http://faculty.gg.uwyo.edu/heller/SedMovs/Sed%20Movie%20files/Moscardo.mov](Moscardo.mov) .

A **lahar** is mudflow that flows down a composite volcano ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NdWRmbG93) ). Ash mixes with snow and
ice melted by the eruption to produce hot, fast-moving flows. The lahar
caused by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Columbia in 1985 killed
more than 23,000 people.

#### Slump and Creep {#10.html#x-ck12-U2x1bXAgYW5kIENyZWVw_21-j0g}

Less dramatic types of mass wasting move Earth materials slowly down a
hillside. **Slump** is the sudden movement of large blocks of rock and
soil down a slope. ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TbHVtcA..) ). All the material moves
together in big chunks. Slumps may happen when a layer of slippery, wet
clay is underneath the rock and soil on a hillside. Or they may occur
when a river (or road) undercuts a slope. Slump leaves behind
crescent-shaped scars on the hillside.

**Creep** is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside.
Creep occurs so slowly you can’t see it happening. You can only see the
effects of creep after years of movement ( **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1CZW50VHJlZUZyb21DcmVlcA..) ). The
slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on
the surface to tilt downhill.

### Prevention and Awareness {#10.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGlvbiBhbmQgQXdhcmVuZXNz_21-rr0}

Landslides cause \$1 billion to \$2 billion damage in the United States
each year. Mass wasting is responsible for traumatic and sudden loss of
life and homes in many areas of the world.

Some communities have developed landslide warning systems. Around San
Francisco Bay, the National Weather Service and the U.S. Geological
Survey use rain gauges to monitor soil moisture. If soil becomes
saturated, the weather service issues a warning. Earthquakes, which may
occur on California’s abundant faults, can also trigger landslides.

To be safe from landslides:

-   Be aware of your surroundings. Notice changes in the natural world.
-   Look for cracks or bulges in hillsides, tilting of decks or patios,
    or leaning poles or fences when rainfall is heavy. Sticking windows
    and doors can indicate ground movement. This is because soil pushes
    slowly against a house and knocks windows and doors out
    of alignment.
-   Look for landslide scars. Landslides are most likely to happen where
    they have occurred before.
-   Plant vegetation and trees on the hillside around your home. This
    helps hold the soil in place.
-   Help to keep a slope stable by building retaining walls. Installing
    good drainage in a hillside may keep the soil from
    getting saturated.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-u47}

-   Landslides are sudden and massive falls of rock down a slope.
    Landslides may be very destructive or even deadly. Slump and creep
    are slower types of mass wasting.
-   Mudflows or lahars, which are volcanic mudflows, are mass movements
    that contain a lot of water.
-   Mass wasting is more likely to occur on slopes that are wet, have
    weak rock, or are undercut. An earthquake or other ground shaking
    can trigger a landslide.
-   To avoid being in a landslide, be aware of signs in a hillside, such
    as cracks or bulges and old landslide scars. To keep a slope stable,
    install good drainage or build retaining walls.

## Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-u2a}

The weathering of rocks and minerals can be mechanical or chemical.
Mechanical weathering changes the size of a mineral or rock. Mechanical
weathering does not change the chemical composition of that material.
Chemical weathering changes the composition of a mineral or rock.
Different types of weathering can alter the same material. Soil forms on
top of rock. The type of soil that forms depends on the environment of
the region. For example, warm and wet climates form different soils than
cold and dry climates. A profile through the soil shows different
horizons. Topsoil is the most important layer for crops. Water, ice,
wind, and gravity create or modify landforms on Earth's surface. These
agents can erode or deposit features that indicate their presence.
Erosion by water and ice lowered and rounded the Appalachians. These old
mountains no longer look like the Himalaya. Someday the Himalaya may
look like the Appalachians do now.

**What has led to these landforms? How do we know?**

This is North America right now. You can pick out a lot of features that
we've been studying. You can even pick out evidence of different
processes. Continental rifting? See where Baja California is separating
from the rest of Mexico. Mountain building? You can see the Sierra
Nevada, Cascades, and Rocky Mountains, among others. Weathering is seen
in the red dirt in the Four Corners area. The Great Lakes are remnants
of the giant glaciers that covered the northern region. Shallow
limestone shelves are seen surrounding Florida. How we know what we know
and what we know about Earth history is touched on very briefly in this
concept.

**How do you find fossils?**

In lots of places, you can go on a field trip to find fossils. The
fossils are found in rock layers. You can break apart the rock layers
and find the fossils.

### What Are Fossils? {#11.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgRm9zc2lscz8.-bje}

Fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the
past. Most preserved remains are hard parts, such as teeth, bones, or
shells. Hard parts are less likely to be destroyed before they can
become fossils. Even so, a very tiny percentage of living things become
fossils. These types of fossils are called **body fossils** ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbW1vbml0ZUZvc3NpbA..) , **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BcmNoYWVvcHRlcnl4) , and **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ucmlsb2JpdGVHcm91cA..) ).

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-wuj}

-   Fossils are the remains or traces of living organisms.
-   Body fossils are usually hard parts, such as bones, teeth,
    and shells.
-   Trace fossils are the traces of organisms, not parts of them. Trace
    fossils include footprints, feces, and burrows.

**Where could you find the best fossils?**

The best fossils would probably be ones that you could get DNA from. DNA
holds the genes of an organisms. The genes could tell scientists a lot
about what the organisms was really like. Where could you find a fossil
with DNA? How about a melting glacier? You might be able to find a
creature that had been frozen into the ice for a long time. A frozen
animal would be very well preserved!

### How Fossils Form {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IEZvc3NpbHMgRm9ybQ.._1-ywa}

The process by which remains or traces of living things become fossils
is called **fossilization** ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMDItZm9zc2lsaXphdGlvbi1mbG93Y2hhcnQ.)
). Most fossils are preserved in sedimentary rocks.

#### Fossils in Sedimentary Rock {#11.html#x-ck12-Rm9zc2lscyBpbiBTZWRpbWVudGFyeSBSb2Nr_1-t2w}

Most fossils form when a dead organism is buried in sediment. Layers of
sediment slowly build up. The sediment is buried and turns into
sedimentary rock. The remains inside the rock also turn to rock. The
remains are replaced by minerals. The remains literally turn to stone.
This type of fossilization is called **permineralization** .

#### Other Ways Fossils Form {#11.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgV2F5cyBGb3NzaWxzIEZvcm0._1-udo}

Fossils may form in other ways. With complete preservation, the organism
doesn't change much. As pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbWJlckRyYWdvbmZseQ..) ), tree sap
may cover an organism and then turn into **amber** . The original
organism is preserved so that scientists might be able to study its DNA.
Organisms can also be completely preserved in tar or ice.

Molds and casts are another way organisms can be fossilized. A **mold**
is an imprint of an organism left in rock. The organism's remains break
down completely. Rock that fills in the mold resembles the original
remains. The fossil that forms in the mold is called a **cast** (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbW1vbml0ZUNhc3Q.) ).
Molds and casts usually form in sedimentary rock. With **compression** (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Gb3NzaWxMZWFm) ), an
organism's remains are put under great pressure inside rock layers. This
leaves behind a dark stain in the rock.

#### Why Fossilization is Rare {#11.html#x-ck12-V2h5IEZvc3NpbGl6YXRpb24gaXMgUmFyZQ.._1-ggf}

It’s very unlikely that any given organism will become a fossil. The
remains of many organisms are consumed. Remains also may be broken down
by other living things or by the elements. Hard parts, such as bones,
are much more likely to become fossils. But even they rarely last long
enough to become fossils. Organisms without hard parts are the least
likely to be fossilized. Fossils of soft organisms, from bacteria to
jellyfish, are very rare.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-8io}

-   Very few fossils preserve soft parts. Insects may be preserved
    in amber. Insects and other animals may be preserved in ice.
-   Some fossils are created when minerals replace the organic material.
    This is called permineralization.
-   A fossil may be in the form of a mold. A mold is the depression left
    in the shape of the material.
-   A fossil may be preserved as a cast. A cast is the rocky material
    that fills the mold.

**How could there be seashells at 20,000 feet?**

Shell beds are found high in the Andes Mountains. How did they get
there? This is more evidence that Earth is a dynamic planet! The rock
that is on top of the mountains was once beneath the sea. Due to plate
tectonics, the mountains rose slowly above the ocean. This process took
a really long time. This is one way we know that Earth is really old!

### Learning from Fossils {#11.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5pbmcgZnJvbSBGb3NzaWxz_2-sjh}

Of all the organisms that ever lived, only a tiny number became fossils.
Still, scientists learn a lot from fossils. Fossils are our best clues
about the history of life on Earth.

#### Fossil Clues {#11.html#x-ck12-Rm9zc2lsIENsdWVz_2-p2z}

Fossils give clues about major geological events. Fossils, like the one
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1GaXNoRm9zc2ls) ), can also give clues
about past climates. Here are just a few examples.

-   Fossils of ocean animals are found at the top of Mt. Everest. Mt.
    Everest is the highest mountain on Earth. These fossils show that
    the area was once at the bottom of a sea. The seabed was later
    uplifted to form the Himalaya mountain range.
-   Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica. Currently, Antarctica is
    almost completely covered with ice. The fossil plants show that
    Antarctica once had a much warmer climate.

#### Index Fossils {#11.html#x-ck12-SW5kZXggRm9zc2lscw.._2-jo2}

Fossils are used to determine the ages of rock layers. **Index fossils**
are the most useful for this. Index fossils are of organisms that lived
over a wide area. They lived for a fairly short period of time. An index
fossil allows a scientist to determine the age of the rock it is in.

Trilobite fossils ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ucmlsb2JpdGVGb3NzaWw.) ) are common
index fossils. Trilobites were widespread marine animals. They lived
between 500 and 600 million years ago. Rock layers containing trilobite
fossils must be that age. Different species of trilobite fossils can be
used to narrow the age even more.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-c2b}

-   Fossils tell a lot about the environment during the time they
    were deposited.
-   Climate is one important thing that can be indicated by fossils.
    This is because organisms have specific conditions in which they
    can live.
-   An index fossil must be distinctive, widespread, and short-lived. It
    indicates a specific period of time.

**Where's a good place to see geology?**

The Southwestern United States is a fantastic place to see geology. The
arid climate means that that the rocks are not covered by vegetation. In
many places, especially the national parks, the formations are
fantastic. The rocks themselves are very interesting. The principles
discussed below are easily seen around the Southwest.

### Relative Age Dating {#11.html#x-ck12-UmVsYXRpdmUgQWdlIERhdGluZw.._3-lru}

Early geologists had no way to determine the absolute age of a
geological material. If they didn't see it form, they couldn't know if a
rock was one hundred years or 100 million years old. What they could do
was determine the ages of materials relative to each other. Using
sensible principles they could say whether one rock was older than
another. They could also determine when a process occurred relative to
those rocks.

#### Laws of Stratigraphy {#11.html#x-ck12-TGF3cyBvZiBTdHJhdGlncmFwaHk._3-zye}

The study of rock strata is called **stratigraphy** . The laws of
stratigraphy can help scientists understand Earth’s past. The laws of
stratigraphy are usually credited to a geologist from Denmark named
Nicolas Steno. He lived in the 1600s. The laws are illustrated in the
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTEtMTUtU3VwZXJwb3NpdGlvbnM.)
; refer to the figure as you read about Steno's laws below.

#### Law of Superposition {#11.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIFN1cGVycG9zaXRpb24._3-zwb}

Superposition refers to the position of rock layers and their relative
ages ( **Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdXBlcnBvc2l0aW9u)
). **Relative age** means age in comparison with other rocks, either
younger or older. The relative ages of rocks are important for
understanding Earth’s history. New rock layers are always deposited on
top of existing rock layers. Therefore, deeper layers must be older than
layers closer to the surface. This is the law of superposition.

older than those at the top. What force eroded the rocks and exposed the

#### Law of Lateral Continuity {#11.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIExhdGVyYWwgQ29udGludWl0eQ.._3-tyd}

Rock layers extend laterally, or out to the sides. They may cover very
broad areas, especially if they formed at the bottom of ancient seas.
Erosion may have worn away some of the rock, but layers on either side
of eroded areas will still “match up.”

The Grand Canyon ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMDgtZ3JhbmQtY2FueW9uLWxhdGVyYWwtY29udGludWl0eQ..)
is a good example of lateral continuity. You can clearly see the same
rock layers on opposite sides of the canyon. The matching rock layers
were deposited at the same time, so they are the same age.

#### Law of Original Horizontality {#11.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIE9yaWdpbmFsIEhvcml6b250YWxpdHk._3-tck}

Sediments were deposited in ancient seas in horizontal, or flat, layers.
If sedimentary rock layers are tilted, they must have moved after they
were deposited.

#### Law of Cross-Cutting Relationships {#11.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIENyb3NzLUN1dHRpbmcgUmVsYXRpb25zaGlwcw.._3-fq6}

Rock layers may have another rock cutting across them, like the igneous
rock pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Dcm9zc0N1dExheWVycw..) ). Which rock
is older? To determine this, we use the law of cross-cutting
relationships. The cut rock layers are older than the rock that cuts
across them.

#### Unconformities {#11.html#x-ck12-VW5jb25mb3JtaXRpZXM._3-ilh}

Geologists can learn a lot about Earth’s history by studying sedimentary
rock layers. But in some places, there’s a gap in time when no rock
layers are present. A gap in the sequence of rock layers is called an
**unconformity** .

Look at the rock layers pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMTEtaHV0dG9uLXVuY29uZm9ybWl0eQ..) );
they show a feature called Hutton’s unconformity. The unconformity was
discovered by James Hutton in the 1700s. Hutton saw that the lower rock
layers are very old. The upper layers are much younger. There are no
layers in between the ancient and recent layers. Hutton thought that the
intermediate rock layers eroded away before the more recent rock layers
were deposited.

Hutton's discovery was a very important event in geology! Hutton
determined that the rocks were deposited over time. Some were eroded
away. Hutton knew that deposition and erosion are very slow. He realized
that for both to occur would take an extremely long time. This made him
realize that Earth must be much older than people thought. This was a
really big discovery! It meant there was enough time for life to evolve
gradually.

**What are the relative ages of these rocks?**

This photo shows rock layers and a fault—the fault is the large diagonal
crack running through this rock. These features can tell us several
things about relative age. Unless the rock was turned over somehow, we
can assume that the layers on top are younger than the layers on the
bottom. Since the fault separates the layers, we can tell that the fault
occurred after all the layers were deposited.

### Determining the Relative Ages of Rocks {#11.html#x-ck12-RGV0ZXJtaW5pbmcgdGhlIFJlbGF0aXZlIEFnZXMgb2YgUm9ja3M._4-vhd}

Steno’s principles are essential for determining the relative ages of
rocks and rock layers. Remember that in relative dating, scientists do
not determine the exact age of a fossil or rock. They look at a sequence
of rocks to try to decipher when an event occurred relative to the other
events represented in that sequence. The **relative age** of a rock,
then, is its age in comparison with other rocks. (1) Do you know which
rock is older and which is younger? (2) Do you know how old the rock's
layers are in years? For relative ages, you know \#1 but not \#2.

An interactive website on relative ages and geologic time is found here:
[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/education/explorations/tours/geotime/gtpage1.html](gtpage1.html)
.

In some cases, it is very tricky to determine the sequence of events
that leads to a certain formation. In the picture below, can you figure
out what happened in what order ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-RXMtMTEtMDItMDQ.) )? Write it down and then
check the following paragraphs.

![Example of a geologic cross
section](ck12_11_files/20150911025951397806.jpeg "Example of a geologic cross section")

**Figure 11.17**

A geologic cross section: Sedimentary rocks (A-C), igneous intrusion
(D), fault (E).

</div>

The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or
intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. The fault cuts
through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also the
intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest feature. The intrusion
(D) cuts through the three sedimentary rock layers, so it must be
younger than those layers. By the law of superposition, C is the oldest
sedimentary rock, B is younger and A is still younger.

The full sequence of events is:

1.  Layer C formed.
2.  Layer B formed.
3.  Layer A formed.
4.  After layers A-B-C were present, intrusion D cut across all three.
5.  Fault E formed, shifting rocks A through C and intrusion D.
6.  Weathering and erosion created a layer of soil on top of layer A.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-bcv}

-   The oldest rock units lie beneath the younger ones.
-   By the principle of cross-cutting relationships (and common sense),
    we know that something must exist before something else can cut
    across it.
-   The history of a section of rocks can be deciphered using the
    principles outlined in this concept.

**How would you correlate two rock units?**

On a field trip in the southwestern United States you would see some
very unique rock layers. You might see a distinctive whitish rock unit
that looks like sand dunes. This rock is the Navajo Sandstone. The first
photo is from the Valley of Fire near Las Vegas, Nevada. The second is
from Capitol Reef National Park in Utah. These sites are roughly 250
miles apart. Sand dunes stretched across this part of the country during
the Mesozoic.

### Matching Rock Layers {#11.html#x-ck12-TWF0Y2hpbmcgUm9jayBMYXllcnM._5-3gr}

When rock layers are in the same place, it’s easy to give them relative
ages. But what if rock layers are far apart? What if they are on
different continents? What evidence is used to match rock layers in
different places?

#### Widespread Rock Layers {#11.html#x-ck12-V2lkZXNwcmVhZCBSb2NrIExheWVycw.._5-x3h}

Some rock layers extend over a very wide area. They may be found on more
than one continent or in more than one country. They are matched up by
**correlation** . For example, the famous White Cliffs of Dover are on
the coast of southeastern England. These distinctive rocks are matched
by similar white cliffs in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and
Denmark ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMTItd2hpdGUtY2xpZmZzLWRvdmVyLWRlbm1hcms.)
). It is important that this chalk layer goes across the English
Channel. The rock is so soft that the Channel Tunnel connecting England
and France was carved into it!

#### Key Beds {#11.html#x-ck12-S2V5IEJlZHM._5-x1o}

Like index fossils, key beds are used to match rock layers. A **key
bed** is a thin layer of rock. The rock must be unique and widespread.
For example, a key bed from around the time that the dinosaurs went
extinct is very important. A thin layer of clay was deposited over much
of Earth’s surface. The clay has large amount of the element iridium.
Iridium is rare on Earth but common in asteroids. This unusual clay
layer has been used to match rock up layers all over the world. It also
led to the hypothesis that a giant asteroid struck Earth and caused the
dinosaurs to go extinct.

#### Using Index Fossils {#11.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgSW5kZXggRm9zc2lscw.._5-vso}

Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers in different places
( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMTMtaW5kZXgtZm9zc2lsLW1hdGNoaW5n) ).
If two rock layers have the same index fossils, then they’re probably
about the same age.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-gr1}

-   A single rock unit contains the story of the geology of
    that location. To understand the geology of a region, scientists
    use correlation.
-   To correlate rock units, something distinctive must be present
    in each. This can include an index fossil, a unique rock type, a key
    bed, or a unique sequence of rocks.
-   A key bed can be global. An example is the iridium layer that was
    deposited at the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions.

    Earth history.

**Why would you want to name time?**

When you refer to events in the history of your life you often link it
to a time period. "When I was in kindergarten..." might be the start of
your story. It helps scientists to have names to refer to events in
Earth history. For this reason, they developed the geologic time scale.

### The Geologic Time Scale {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdlb2xvZ2ljIFRpbWUgU2NhbGU._6-ncj}

Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. Geologists divide this time span
into smaller periods. Many of the divisions mark major events in life
history.

#### Dividing Geologic Time {#11.html#x-ck12-RGl2aWRpbmcgR2VvbG9naWMgVGltZQ.._6-w3v}

Divisions in Earth history are recorded on the **geologic time scale** .
For example, the Cretaceous ended when the dinosaurs went extinct.
European geologists were the first to put together the geologic time
scale. So, many of the names of the time periods are from places in
Europe. The Jurassic Period is named for the Jura Mountains in France
and Switzerland, for example.

#### Putting Events in Order {#11.html#x-ck12-UHV0dGluZyBFdmVudHMgaW4gT3JkZXI._6-5cl}

To create the geologic time scale, geologists correlated rock layers.
Steno's laws were used to determine the relative ages of rocks. Older
rocks are at the bottom, and younger rocks are at the top. The early
geologic time scale could only show the order of events. The discovery
of radioactivity in the late 1800s changed that. Scientists could
determine the exact age of some rocks in years. They assigned dates to
the time scale divisions. For example, the Jurassic began about 200
million years ago. It lasted for about 55 million years.

#### Divisions of the Geologic Time Scale {#11.html#x-ck12-RGl2aXNpb25zIG9mIHRoZSBHZW9sb2dpYyBUaW1lIFNjYWxl_6-ugf}

The largest blocks of time on the geologic time scale are called “eons.”
Eons are split into “eras.” Each era is divided into “periods.” Periods
may be further divided into “epochs.” Geologists may just use “early” or
“late.” An example is “late Jurassic,” or “early Cretaceous.” Pictured
below is the geologic time scale ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTItMDEtZ2VvbG9naWMtdGltZS1zY2FsZQ..) ).

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-z6a}

-   The geologic time scale divides Earth history into named units.
    Naming time periods makes it easier to talk about them.
-   The units of the time scale are separated by major events in Earth
    or life history.
-   In the geologic time scale, time units are divided and subdivided
    into smaller pieces.

**How could you tell the age of this ruin?**

Mesa Verde in Southwestern Colorado is the site of beautiful cliff
dwellings. The people who inhabited these dwellings are long gone. If
you go there you will hear the history of the area, complete with dates.
How do archeologists know when the people lived here? How do they know
the ages of the structures there? Tree ring dating is extremely useful
for finding the age of ancient structures.

### Tree Ring Dating {#11.html#x-ck12-VHJlZSBSaW5nIERhdGluZw.._7-elz}

Cut into a tree and you can see its rings. In some locations, the summer
growth band is light-colored and the winter band is dark. Each
light-dark band represents one year. You can tell how long the tree
lived by counting the number of **tree rings** ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-RXMtMTEtMDMtMDE.) ). Age dating by tree rings is
called **dendrochronology** .

**Figure 11.21**

</div>

You can tell other things from tree rings too. In a good year a tree
will produce a wide ring. A summer drought will produce a smaller ring.
These variations will appear in all trees in a region. The same pattern
can be found in all the trees in the area. This pattern helps scientist
to identify a particular time period.

Scientists have records of tree rings going back over the past 2,000
years. By matching up patterns they can tell when a tree (or a piece of
wood from one) lived. Wood fragments from old buildings and ancient
ruins can be age dated. The outermost ring gives the date when the tree
died.

An example of how tree-ring dating is used to date houses in the United
Kingdom is found in the following article:
[http://www.periodproperty.co.uk/ppuk\_discovering\_article\_013.shtml](ppuk_discovering_article_013.shtml)
.

### Ice Cores {#11.html#x-ck12-SWNlIENvcmVz_7-xfj}

Other processes create yearly layers that can be used for dating. On a
glacier, snow falls in winter. In summer, dust accumulates. This leads
to a snow-dust annual pattern. This pattern can be seen down into the
ice ( **Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-RXMtMTEtMDMtMDI.) ). Scientists
drill deep into ice sheets. **Ice cores** can be hundreds of meters
long. The ice cores show how the environment has changed. Gas bubbles in
the ice can be analyzed to show how atmospheric gases have changed. This
can yield clues about climate. Long ice cores have allowed scientists to
create a record of polar climate going back hundreds of thousands of
years.

### Varves {#11.html#x-ck12-VmFydmVz_7-cw8}

Lake sediments also have an annual pattern. This is easy to see in lakes
that are located at the end of glaciers. The glacier melts rapidly in
the summer. This produces a thick deposit of sediment in the lake. Thin,
clay-rich layers are deposited in the winter. The resulting layers are
called **varves** . Varves give scientists clues about past climate
conditions ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTEtMzctdmFydmU.) ). A warm summer might
result in a very thick sediment layer. A cooler summer might yield a
thinner layer. Like tree rings, these patterns can be used to identify
time periods.

**When do you stop counting?**

Pretend that the large green cylinder is a parent isotope. Now you can
visualize the decay of the parent to the daughter. It's easy to see that
the second cylinder is half the size of the first. The third is half the
size of the second. But when the cylinders get small, the differences
are much harder to see. At some point, there is too little of the parent
left. That isotope pair is no longer useful for dating.

### Radioactive Decay {#11.html#x-ck12-UmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRGVjYXk._8-sl7}

**Radioactive decay** is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable
elements. To understand this process, recall that the atoms of all
elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons.

#### Isotopes {#11.html#x-ck12-SXNvdG9wZXM._8-5zm}

An element is defined by the number of protons it contains. All atoms of
a given element contain the same number of protons. The number of
neutrons in an element may vary. Atoms of an element with different
numbers of neutrons are called **isotopes** .

Consider carbon as an example. Two isotopes of carbon are shown below (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMTQtY2FyYm9uLWlzb3RvcGVz)
). Compare their protons and neutrons. Both contain six protons. But
carbon-12 has six neutrons and carbon-14 has eight neutrons.

Isotopes are named for their number of protons plus neutrons. If a
carbon atom had seven neutrons, what would it be named?

Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12. This is a stable isotope of
carbon. Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms are carbon-14. carbon-14
is unstable. It is a **radioactive isotope** of carbon. Pictured below
is carbon dioxide ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMTUtY2FyYm9uLTE0LWZvcm1hdGlvbg..) ),
which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen. Neutrons in
cosmic rays strike nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. The nitrogen forms
carbon-14. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form carbon
dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In this
way, carbon-14 enters food chains.

#### Decay of Unstable Isotopes {#11.html#x-ck12-RGVjYXkgb2YgVW5zdGFibGUgSXNvdG9wZXM._8-azm}

Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays. The
original atoms are called the **parent isotopes** . For carbon-14 decay,
each carbon-14 atom loses an beta particle. It changes to a stable atom
of nitrogen-14. The stable atom at the end is the **daughter product** (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTEtMTYtY2FyYm9uLTE0LWRlY2F5)
).

**Figure 11.26**

Unstable isotopes, such as carbon-14, decay by losing atomic particles.
They form different, stable elements when they decay.

</div>

The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a
constant rate. This rate is different for each parent-daughter isotope
pair. The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. The
**half-life** is the time it takes for half of a given amount of an
isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730
years. Imagine that you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14. In 5,730
years, half of it decays. This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14. Over the
next 5,730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay. Now there are
25 grams of carbon-14. How many grams will there be in another 5,730
years? The figure below graphs the rate of decay of a substance (

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-vzf}

-   A half-life is the time it takes for half of the parent isotopes of
    an element to change to the daughter product.
-   With alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons.
-   Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years.

**Can wood give an age in another way?**

In the section on tree ring dating, there was a photo of a ruin at Mesa
Verde National Park. This photo is also from Mesa Verde. In
archeological sites, wood can be dated by tree rings. It can also be
dated by radiometric dating. Carbon-14 dating is very useful for ruins
that contain wood. If the tree died around the time the ladder was
created, then carbon-14 can tell the age of the ladder. If the ladder
was built for the site, then that age will be the age of the
archeological site.

### Radiometric Dating {#11.html#x-ck12-UmFkaW9tZXRyaWMgRGF0aW5n_9-mkt}

The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the
absolute ages of fossils and rocks. This type of dating is called
**radiometric dating** .

#### Carbon-14 Dating {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uLTE0IERhdGluZw.._9-uou}

The best-known method of radiometric dating is **carbon-14 dating** .
This method is also called radiocarbon dating. A living thing takes in
carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12). As the carbon-14 decays, it is
replaced with more carbon-14. After the organism dies, it stops taking
in carbon. That includes carbon-14. The carbon-14 that is in its body
continues to decay. So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as
time goes on. We can estimate the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed
by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12. We know how fast
carbon-14 decays. With this information, we can tell how long ago the
organism died.

Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life. It decays quickly compared
to some other unstable isotopes. So carbon-14 dating is useful for
specimens younger than 50,000 years old. That’s a blink of an eye in
geologic time. But radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent
events. One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites. Carbon-14
dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things. To date
rocks, scientists use other radioactive isotopes.

#### Other Radioactive Isotopes {#11.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgUmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgSXNvdG9wZXM._9-jgn}

The isotopes listed below ( **Table**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-SXNvdG9wZS1Sb2NrLURhdGluZw..) ) are used to date
igneous rocks. These isotopes have much longer half-lives than
carbon-14. Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much
older specimens. Which of these isotopes could be used to date a rock
that formed half a million years ago? How about half a billion years
ago?

  **Unstable Isotope**   **Decays to**   **At a Half-Life of (years)**   **Dates Rocks Aged (years old)**
  ---------------------- --------------- ------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  Potassium-40           Argon-40        1.3 billion                     100 thousand – 1 billion
  Uranium-235            Lead-207        700 million                     1 million – 4.5 billion
  Uranium-238            Lead-206        4.5 billion                     1 million – 4.5 billion

#### Limitations of Radiometric Dating {#11.html#x-ck12-TGltaXRhdGlvbnMgb2YgUmFkaW9tZXRyaWMgRGF0aW5n_9-jas}

Radiometric dating is a very useful tool, but it does have limits:

1.  The material being dated must have measurable amounts of the parent
    and/or the daughter isotopes.
2.  Radiometric dating can only be done on some materials. It is not
    useful for determining the age of sedimentary rocks. For this,
    geologists date a nearby igneous rock. Then they use relative dating
    techniques to figure out the age of the sedimentary rock. They may
    not get it exactly, but there will be some idea.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-sxn}

-   Radiocarbon is useful for relatively young, carbon-based materials.
    Other longer-lived isotopes are good for older rocks and minerals.
-   Different isotope pairs are useful for certain materials of
    certain ages.
-   Radiometric dating cannot be used if parent or daughter are
    not measurable.

**What is deep time?**

We can look so far out into space that it's hard to imagine the
distances. We also have trouble imagining the extend of geologic time.
This section might help.

### Age of Earth {#11.html#x-ck12-QWdlIG9mIEVhcnRo_10-kej}

Earth scientists use radiometric dating, index fossils, and other clues.
They have determined that Earth is 4.6 billion years old. The planet is
the same age as the rest of the solar system.

**Where are stars born? Are stars being born right now?**

Stars are born in clouds like the one in the picture. Gravity pulls
material together. When it is extremely dense, it begins nuclear fusion.
That is, it becomes a star. We can see places where stars are being born
right now. Of course, it takes light a long time to travel to us. So
what we see right now may have happened many millions or even billions
of years ago.

### Formation of the Solar System {#11.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIHRoZSBTb2xhciBTeXN0ZW0._11-lrb}

Our solar system began about 5 billion years ago. The Sun, planets, and
other solar system objects all formed at about the same time. The
leading hypothesis for how they formed is called the **nebular
hypothesis** .

#### The Solar Nebula {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNvbGFyIE5lYnVsYQ.._11-u9o}

The Sun and planets formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust. This was
the **solar nebula** . The cloud contracted and began to spin. As it
contracted, its temperature and pressure increased. The cloud spun
faster and formed into a disk. Scientists think the solar system at that
time looked like these disk-shaped objects in the Orion Nebula. New
stars are forming in the Orion Nebula today.

#### Solar System Bodies Form {#11.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgU3lzdGVtIEJvZGllcyBGb3Jt_11-dnu}

Gravity pulled a lot of material to the center of the cloud.
Temperatures and pressures at the center of the cloud were extreme. It
was so hot that **nuclear fusion** reactions began. A star was born—the
Sun. In these reactions, hydrogen fuses to make helium. Extreme amounts
of energy are released.

**Figure 11.28**

An artist’s painting of a protoplanetary disk.

</div>

Meanwhile, the outer parts of the disk were cooling off. Matter
condensed from the cloud. Small pieces of dust started clumping
together. These clumps collided and combined with other clumps. Gravity
brought more clumps together to make larger bodies. Gravity at the
center of the disk attracted rock and metal. Lighter material remained
farther out in the disk. Eventually, these small bodies grew to become
the planets and moons that we find in our solar system today.

#### The Planets {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsYW5ldHM._11-n0m}

Since gravity pulled the heavy material inward, the inner
planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are made of rock and metal. The
outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—condensed farther
from the Sun ( **Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMDItU3Vu)
). They are made from lighter materials such as hydrogen, helium, water,
ammonia, and methane. Out by jupiter and beyond, where it’s very cold,
these materials form solid particles. Dwarf plants, comets, and
asteroids formed too.

The nebular hypothesis explains the basic features of the solar system:

-   The orbits of the planets lie in nearly the same plane. The Sun is
    at the center.
-   The planets revolve in the same direction.
-   The planets mostly rotate in the same direction.
-   The axes of rotation of the planets are mostly nearly perpendicular
    to the orbital plane.
-   The oldest Moon rocks are 4.5 billion years old.

This video, from the ESA, discusses the Sun, planets, and other bodies
in the solar system and how they formed. The first part of the video
explores the evolution of our view of the solar system starting with the
early Greeks who reasoned that since some points of light—which they
called planets—moved faster than the stars, they must be closer:

**What was early Earth like?**

Earth was not always the planet it is today. In its earliest days, Earth
was scorching hot. It did not have an atmosphere or water. If life
originated early on, it was wiped out by the terrible conditions.

### Formation of Earth and Moon {#11.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIEVhcnRoIGFuZCBNb29u_12-d0s}

Material at similar distances from the Sun collided together to form
each of the planets. Earth grew from material in its part of space. The
Moon’s origin is completely different from Earth’s.

#### Earth Forms {#11.html#x-ck12-RWFydGggRm9ybXM._12-awm}

Earth formed like the other planets. Different materials in its region
of space collided. Eventually, the material made a planet. All of the
collisions caused Earth to heat up. Rock and metal melted. The molten
material separated into layers. Gravity pulled the denser material into
the center. The lighter elements rose to the surface ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTItMDYtRWFydGgtc2VwYXJhdGluZy1pbnRvLWxheWVycw..)
). Because the material separated, Earth’s core is made mostly of iron.
Earth’s crust is made mostly of lighter materials. In between the crust
and the core is Earth’s mantle, made of solid rock.

#### Moon Forms {#11.html#x-ck12-TW9vbiBGb3Jtcw.._12-tes}

This model for how the Moon formed is the best fit of all of the data
scientists have about the Moon.

In the early solar system, there was a lot of space debris. Asteroids
flew around, sometimes striking the planets. An asteroid the size of
Mars smashed into Earth. The huge amount of energy from the impact
melted most of Earth. The asteroid melted too. Material from both Earth
and the asteroid was thrown out into orbit. Over time, this material
smashed together to form our Moon. The lunar surface of the Moon is
about 4.5 billion years old. This means that the collision happened
about 70 million years after Earth formed.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-qwb}

-   Earth grew from material that collided in its part of space.
-   The material melted and gravity separated it into layers.
-   An enormous asteroid struck Earth. The material flew into orbit and
    came together to form the Moon.

**What did Earth look like at first?**

The earliest Earth did not have an atmosphere or free water. The planet
was far too hot for gases and water to collect. The atmosphere and
oceans that we see today evolved over time. The gases came from volcanic
eruptions and from comets.

### Formation of the Atmosphere and Oceans {#11.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIHRoZSBBdG1vc3BoZXJlIGFuZCBPY2VhbnM._13-stx}

An atmosphere is the gases that surround a planet. The early Earth had
no atmosphere. Conditions were so hot that gases were not stable.

#### Earth's First Atmosphere {#11.html#x-ck12-RWFydGgncyBGaXJzdCBBdG1vc3BoZXJl_13-juk}

Earth’s first atmosphere was different from the current one. The gases
came from two sources. Volcanoes spewed gases into the air. Comets
carried in ices from outer space. These ices warmed and became gases.
Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor, or water in gas
form, were in the first atmosphere ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTItMDctYXRtb3NwaGVyZS1mb3JtYXRpb24.) ).
Take a look at the list of gases. What's missing? The early atmosphere
had almost no oxygen.

Gases from Earth’s interior came through volcanoes and into the
atmosphere.

#### The Early Oceans {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVhcmx5IE9jZWFucw.._13-az8}

Earth’s atmosphere slowly cooled. Once it was cooler, water vapor could
condense. It changed back to its liquid form. Liquid water could fall to
Earth’s surface as rain. Over millions of years water collected to form
the oceans. Water began to cycle on Earth as water evaporated from the
oceans and returned again as rainfall.

Streams carry dissolved minerals. These ions make the oceans salty.
Marine sedimentary rocks are found that are four billion years old. The
first oceans could have formed as early as 4.2 to 4.4 billion years ago!

#### The Later Atmosphere {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExhdGVyIEF0bW9zcGhlcmU._13-ilt}

Eventually plants evolved. Plants produce oxygen as a product of
photosynthesis. Oxygen spread around the planet about 2.5 billion years
ago. Many organisms died off because they could not handle the oxygen.
But this development was extremely important for other life. Animals
need oxygen to breathe. If photosynthesis had not evolved there would be
no animals.

Oxygen is needed to make ozone. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen
ions. Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks harmful solar radiation from
reaching the surface. Without oxygen, life on Earth would have been very
simple.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-j6i}

-   Earth's first atmosphere came from the planet's interior. Gases also
    came from asteroids and comets from elsewhere in the solar system.
-   There was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until plants evolved.
    Oxygen allowed animals to evolve and ozone to form.
-   The first oceans formed when water rained out of the atmosphere
    into basins.

**When did Earth become a dynamic planet?**

Earth was always dynamic! Earth has changed many times over billions of
years. Huge mountains have formed, been destroyed, and been replaced
with new mountains. Continents have moved, split apart, and collided
with each other. Ocean basins have opened up. Life on Earth evolved
slowly for billions of years.

### Early Continents {#11.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgQ29udGluZW50cw.._14-e1g}

The earliest crust was probably basalt. It may have resembled the
current seafloor. This crust formed before there were any oceans. More
than four billion years ago, continental crust appeared. The first
continents were very small compared with those today.

#### Continents Grow {#11.html#x-ck12-Q29udGluZW50cyBHcm93_14-oqv}

Continents grow when **microcontinents** , or small continents, collide
with each other or with a larger continent. Oceanic island arcs also
collide with continents to make them grow.

#### Cratons {#11.html#x-ck12-Q3JhdG9ucw.._14-hln}

The earliest continental crust is now found in the ancient cores of
continents, called the **cratons** . Geologists can learn many things
about the Precambrian by studying the rocks of the cratons.

-   Cratons contain felsic igneous rocks, which are remnants of the
    first continents.
-   Cratonic rocks contain rounded sedimentary grains. Rounded grains
    indicate that the minerals eroded from an earlier rock. It also
    means that rivers or seas existed.
-   One common rock type in the cratons is **greenstone** , a
    metamorphosed volcanic rock ( **Figure**
    [below](#11.html#x-ck12-RVMtMTItMDktaG9wZXdlbGwtaXNsYW5kcw..) ).
    Since greenstones are found today in oceanic trenches, what does the
    presence of greenstones mean? These ancient greenstones indicate the
    presence of subduction zones.

#### Supercontinents {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJjb250aW5lbnRz_14-woo}

There are times in Earth history when all of the continents come
together to form a **supercontinent** . Supercontinents come together
and then break apart. Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth, but
it was not the first. The supercontinent before Pangaea is called
Rodinia. Rodinia contained about 75% of the continental landmass that is
present today. The supercontinent came together about 1.1 billion years
ago. Rodinia was not the first supercontinent either. Scientists think
that three supercontinents came before Rodina, making five so far in
Earth history.

#### Early Plate Tectonics {#11.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgUGxhdGUgVGVjdG9uaWNz_14-m9w}

Since the early Earth was very hot, mantle convection was very rapid.
Plate tectonics likely moved quickly. The early Earth was an active
place with abundant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. The remnants of
these early rocks are now seen in the ancient cores of the continents.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-7xi}

-   The first crust was basalt. It resembled the modern seafloor.
-   Microcontinents come together to create continents
    and supercontinents.
-   Convection on early Earth was faster and so plate tectonics
    was faster. Since then, Earth has been cooling.

**Could these mountains have existed in the Paleozoic?**

Sure! There have been lots of huge mountain ranges in Earth history.
When continents collide, big mountains grow. The formation of Pangaea
created long large mountain ranges. The mountains that formed then look
a lot like the Himalayas do today.

### The Paleozoic Era {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBhbGVvem9pYyBFcmE._15-rbm}

The Paleozoic is the earliest era of the Phanerozoic. The Paleozoic was
also the longest era of the Phanerozoic. But the Paleozoic was
relatively recent. It began only 570 million years ago. At the start of
the Paleozoic, there was a supercontinent called Rodinia. The
supercontinent broke apart during the early part of the Paleozoic.

The Phanerozoic is recent history compared with the Precambrian. This is
one reason that the Paleozoic is much better known than the Precambrian.
Another reason is that Paleozoic organisms had hard parts, and they
fossilized better.

#### Formation of Pangaea {#11.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIFBhbmdhZWE._15-kjw}

A mountain-building event is called an **orogeny** . Orogenies take
place over tens or hundreds of millions of years. Continents smash into
each other. Microcontinents and island arcs smash into continents. All
of these events cause mountains to rise.

When Pangaea came together there were orogenies all along the collision
zones. Geologists find much evidence of these orogenies. For example,
Laurentia collided with the Taconic Island Arc during the Taconic
Orogeny ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItMjQtdGFjb25pYy1vcm9nZW55) ). The
remnants of this mountain range make up the Taconic Mountains in New
York.

</div>

Laurentia experienced other orogenies as it collided with the northern
continents. The southern continents came together to form Gondwana. When
Laurentia and Gondwana collided to create Pangaea, the Appalachians
rose. Geologists think the Appalachians were once higher than the
Himalayas are now.

#### Pangaea {#11.html#x-ck12-UGFuZ2FlYQ.._15-89s}

Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth. Evidence for the existence
of Pangaea was what Alfred Wegener used to create his continental drift
hypothesis. Continental drift is described in the chapter *Plate
Tectonics* .

As the continents move, the shape of the oceans changes too. At the time
of Pangaea, most of Earth’s water was collected in a huge ocean. This
ocean was called Panthalassa ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QYW5nYWVhRXZvbHV0aW9u) ).

**Do you like the beach? If so, the Paleozoic may be for you!**

If we were living right now at the time of a marine transgression, there

### Marine Transgressions and Regressions {#11.html#x-ck12-TWFyaW5lIFRyYW5zZ3Jlc3Npb25zIGFuZCBSZWdyZXNzaW9ucw.._16-jhq}

Sea level rises and falls. During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, the seas
rose over the continents. This is called a **marine transgression** .
During a **marine regression** , the sea level retreats. The Paleozoic
had four complete cycles of marine transgressions and regressions. The
Mesozoic had two ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItMjEtVHJhbnNncmVzc2lvbnM.) ).

What makes sea level rise? There are two possibilities: either the land
sinks or the water level rises. Tectonic processes can cause the land to
sink. Melting glaciers can cause the water level to rise. Sea level
rises if seafloor spreading goes faster. The hotter crust is buoyed up
and displaces the water. This causes the ocean basin to become smaller.
What could cause sea level to fall in a marine regression? Land rises
up. Glaciers grow. Seafloor spreading slows down. Just the opposite of
what makes sea level rise!

Geologists think that the Paleozoic marine transgressions and
regressions were the result of the decrease and increase in the size of
glaciers covering the lands.

### Rock Facies {#11.html#x-ck12-Um9jayBGYWNpZXM._16-6wx}

Geologists know about marine transgressions and regressions from
sedimentary rocks. These events leave characteristic rock layers known
as sedimentary **facies** . Sand and other coarse grained rock fragments
are deposited on the beach where the wave energy is high. Offshore in
lower energy environments, fine-grained silt is deposited. Farther
offshore in lower energy waters, carbonate mud that later hardens is
deposited. The rocks that result are sandstone, shale, and limestone. As
the sea moves on or offshore, one rock layer is on top of the other.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-4mi}

-   Sea level depends on the relationship of the water level to
    the land.
-   Sea level will rise when glaciers melt. Sea level will fall when
    glaciers grow.
-   Facies are characteristic rock layers, such as sandstone, shale,
    limestone for a marine transgression. The reverse indicates a
    marine regression.

**Why would a supercontinent break up?**

A continent is like a giant blanket that traps heat. Heat from the
mantle comes up but cannot escape through the continent. This image
shows hot material beneath New Mexico. The heat is trapped beneath the
North American plate. The hot material is causing rifting to begin. This
is known as the Rio Grande Rift.

### Supercontinent Breakup {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJjb250aW5lbnQgQnJlYWt1cA.._17-ipd}

Why would a supercontinent break up? Remember that Earth's interior is
hot. Heat builds up beneath the supercontinent. This causes the
continent to buoy upward. Continental rifting begins. Basalt lava fills
in the rift. This could lead to seafloor spreading and the formation of
a new ocean basin. This basalt province is where Africa is splitting
apart and generating basalt lava. ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItMjYtRXRoaW9waWE.) )

#### The Breakup of Pangaea {#11.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJyZWFrdXAgb2YgUGFuZ2FlYQ.._17-qwh}

At the end of the Paleozoic, there was one continent and one ocean. Then
Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago. The
Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected
oceans that we see today on Earth.

Continental rifting and then seafloor spreading pushed Africa and South
America. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed in between the continents.
Seafloor spreading continues to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean ( **Figure**
[above](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItMjYtRXRoaW9waWE.) ).

### Growth of Continents {#11.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIG9mIENvbnRpbmVudHM._17-hdl}

The moving continents collided with island arcs and **microcontinents**
. Mountain ranges grew near the continents’ edges. The oceanic Farallon
plate subducted beneath western North America during the late Jurassic
and early Cretaceous. This activity produced igneous intrusions and
other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted. They are
exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-MTItMjctc25vdy1jb3ZlcmVkLVNpZXJyYS1uZXZhZGE.) ).

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-jka}

-   Continents keep mantle heat from escaping. This may eventually lead
    to continental rifting.
-   Continents grow as microcontinents or igneous activity add
    continental crust to an existing continent.
-   When a supercontinent breaks apart, new seafloor forms between the
    new continental masses.

**How does the Cenozoic end?**

We don't know how the Cenozoic ends. We're still in it! The Cenozoic has
been going on for 65 million years. Toward the very end of this time,
humans have evolved. We are now witness to the geology of the Cenozoic.
What came earlier in this era looks a lot like what is going on now.

### Cenozoic {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2Vub3pvaWM._18-rkf}

The Cenozoic began around 65.5 million years ago. We say that it begins
after the Cretaceous extinction. We are still in the Cenozoic today. The
Cenozoic accounts for only about 1.5% of Earth’s total history. But
since it's the the most recent era, it is the one we know the most
about. Much of what has been discussed elsewhere in this text describes
the geology of the Cenozoic. A few highlights are mentioned here.

### Plate Tectonics {#11.html#x-ck12-UGxhdGUgVGVjdG9uaWNz_18-kvf}

The plate tectonics of the Cenozoic are still going on today. Early in
the Cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to form the Rocky Mountains.
Subduction off of the Pacific Northwest formed the Cascades volcanic
arc. Crust is being pulled apart to form the Basin and Range province
that centers on Nevada.

#### Evolution of the San Andreas Fault {#11.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIHRoZSBTYW4gQW5kcmVhcyBGYXVsdA.._18-shf}

The San Andreas Fault is where the Pacific and North American plates
meet ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItMjktc2FuLWFuZHJlYXMtZmF1bHQ.) ). How
did the San Andreas Fault form? The Farallon Plate was subducting
beneath the North American Plate. This began about 30 million years ago.
By 20 million years ago, the Pacific Plate and East Pacific Rise
spreading center had started to subduct. This split the Farallon Plate
into two smaller plates. The plates started a transform motion where the
Pacific and North American plates meet. This formed the San Andreas
Fault. The fault moved inland.

This figure shows the evolution of the San Andreas Fault zone from 30
million years ago (bottom) to present (top).

</div>

Most Cenozoic plate tectonic activity involves continents moving apart.
But smaller regions are coming together. Africa collided with Eurasia to
create the Alps. India crashed into Asia to form the Himalayas.

### Ice Ages {#11.html#x-ck12-SWNlIEFnZXM._18-7se}

The Pleistocene ice ages began 2.6 million years ago. Glaciers advanced
and retreated four times ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE3MDMtMDE.) ). During the retreats,
the climate was often warmer than it is today.

These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic
ice cap is today. The Pleistocene ice ages guided the evolution of life
in the Cenozoic, including the evolution of humans.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-bd8}

-   During the Cenozoic, Pangaea began to split up.
-   Subduction of the Farallon plate has resulted in the formation of
    the Rocky Mountains and the San Andreas Fault.
-   The Pleistocene was marked by four advances of ice. The remnants of
    the last advance of glaciers are found today.

## Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-1fs}

Fossils are remnants of living creatures. Fossils give clues about what
conditions were like when the organism lived. Fossils help geologists
understand the geological history of an area. Clues from rocks can help
scientists decipher the history of a region too. Relative dating allows
geologists to figure out the order of events. Correlation allows them to
understand the geological history of a region. Absolute age dating gives
real dates for geological events. Radiometric dating uses the ratios of
parent and daughter isotopes to indicate age. The solar system began as
a cloud of dust and gas. That cloud spun and contracted by gravity. The
center became so dense it ignited to form a star. Clumps of matter came
together to form the planets. Shortly after Earth formed, a giant
asteroid struck the planet. Both Earth and the asteroid melted. Material
was flung out into Earth's orbit. That material came together to make
the Moon. Earth had to cool before it could support an atmosphere. Once
it had an atmosphere, rain fell into basins to create the oceans. Gases
in the early atmosphere came from volcanic eruptions. Comets and
asteroids also brought in gases. There was almost no oxygen. It was not
until the evolution of photosynthesis that oxygen collected in the
atmosphere. With oxygen animals could evolve. Also, oxygen was needed to
form the ozone layer. The early Earth was extremely hot. Convection and
plate tectonics were faster than today. During Earth history,
supercontinents formed and broke apart. Seas transgressed and regressed.
Ice ages came and went.

**What is Earth's most unique feature?**

Mars is a lot like Earth. Mars is rocky and has an atmosphere. Mars even
has water! But Mars (and Mercury, Venus, the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune) does not have any evidence of life. Life is what
makes Earth unique. It is also part of Earth's dynamic nature. Life is
part of many Earth processes. Life is also dynamic in itself. Constantly
adapting and evolving, life forms are always changing. Except those that
are so well adapted to their environment, they haven't changed in
hundreds of millions of years.

**Do you know life on Earth?**

It's likely that there are many places on Earth that you would not
recognize as being on your home planet. There are also many creatures
that you would not realize that you share a planet with. That's because
of the incredible diversity of species. Wouldn't it be fun to see some
of these unusual creatures?

### Biological Diversity {#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvbG9naWNhbCBEaXZlcnNpdHk.-lpg}

More than 1.3 million species of organisms have been cataloged. Many
millions of species have not been discovered yet. Scientists estimate
that there may be about 8.7 million species in all. Why does the planet
have so much biological diversity? (Biological diversity is shortened to
**biodiversity** .) The tremendous variety of organisms is due to the
tremendous numbers of habitats that they have evolved to fill.

#### Ways to Live in the Environment {#12.html#x-ck12-V2F5cyB0byBMaXZlIGluIHRoZSBFbnZpcm9ubWVudA..-kly}

Each organism has the ability to survive in a specific environment. Dry
desert environments are difficult to live in. Desert plants have special
stems and leaves to conserve water ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbG9lVmVyYVBsYW50) ). Animals have
other ways to live in the desert. The Namib Desert receives only 1.5
inches of rainfall each year. The Namib Desert beetle lives there. How
do the beetles get enough water to survive? Early morning fog deposits
water droplets. The droplets collect on a beetle's wings and back (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OYW1pYkRlc2VydEJlZXRsZQ..)
). The beetle tilts its rear end up. When the droplet is heavy enough,
it slides forward. It lands in the beetle’s mouth. There are many other
environments that need unique approaches for survival ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdG9hdEluU25vdw..) and
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Dcm93bmVkQ3JhbmU.) ).

#### Getting Food and Being Food (Or Not) {#12.html#x-ck12-R2V0dGluZyBGb29kIGFuZCBCZWluZyBGb29kIChPciBOb3Qp-ocd}

Organisms must be able to get food and avoid being food. Hummingbirds
have long, thin beaks that help them drink nectar from flowers. Some
flowers are tubular. Different species of flowers have tubes of
different lengths. Different species of hummingbirds have different
lengths of beaks. A particular hummingbird species has evolved to feed
from one or a few species of flowers.

The battle between needing food and being food plays out in the drama
between lions and zebras. When a herd of zebras senses a lion, the
animals run away. The zebras’ dark stripes confuse the lions. It becomes
hard for them to focus on just one zebra. The zebras may get away. But
lions are swift and agile. A lion may be able to get a zebra, maybe one
that's old or sick.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-ido}

-   There are 1.3 million known species, but many more have not
    been discovered.
-   The enormous number of species is due to the tremendous variety of
    environments in which they can live.
-   Organisms have features that help them to find food or avoid
    being eaten.

so! Of course, you have to ignore the trees in the distance.

### The Origin Of Life {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE9yaWdpbiBPZiBMaWZl_1-djg}

No one knows how or when life first began on the turbulent early Earth.
There is little hard evidence from so long ago. Scientists think that it
is extremely likely that life began and was wiped out. Possibly even
more than once! If there was life, it would have been wiped out by the
impact that created the moon.

This issue of what's living and what's not is important. It helps us to
think about the origin of life. When does a blob of organic material
become life? As you can see, we need to have a definition of life.

#### Characteristics of Life {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIExpZmU._1-2c1}

To be considered alive, a molecule must:

-   be organic. The organic molecules needed are amino acids.
-   have a metabolism.
-   be capable of replication (be able to reproduce).

**Amino acids** are molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These
molecules are called the building blocks of life because they create
proteins. **Proteins** are complex organic molecules that make up cells.
They are the most abundant class of biological molecules.

#### Learning About the Origin of Life {#12.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5pbmcgQWJvdXQgdGhlIE9yaWdpbiBvZiBMaWZl_1-lkw}

To look for information regarding the origin of life, scientists:

-   perform experiments to recreate the environmental conditions found
    at that time.
-   study the living creatures that make their homes in
    extreme environments. These environments are most like Earth’s
    early days.
-   seek traces of life left by ancient microorganisms, also called
    **microbes** ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb21lTWljcm9iZXM.) ). These
    include microscopic features or chemistry left by life. It is very
    difficult to distinguish these from non-biological features.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-ygl}

-   For something to be alive it must be organic, have a metabolism, and
    be capable of replication.
-   Amino acids create proteins. They are the building blocks of life.
-   To learn about the origins of life, scientists perform experiments.
    They study creatures that live in extreme environments. They look
    for traces of life that were left by ancient microbes.

**What is an RNA world?**

DNA passes most genetic information today. But some scientists think
that for the first life on Earth, genetic information was passed by RNA.
They call this the RNA world hypothesis.

### Metabolism {#12.html#x-ck12-TWV0YWJvbGlzbQ.._2-ml8}

Organic molecules must carry out the chemical work of cells. This is
their **metabolism** . Living organisms need chemical reactions to live,
grow, and reproduce. The chemical reactions occur in sequences of steps.
These sequences are known as metabolic pathways. The metabolic pathways
are very similar for all life on Earth. That includes single celled
bacteria that have been around for billions of years. It includes the
most complex life forms on Earth today. What does it mean that the
metabolic pathways are so similar for all life? This means that the
metabolic pathways evolved very early in Earth's history.

### Replication {#12.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24._2-x7r}

Living cells need organic molecules, known as **nucleic acids** .
Nucleic acids are molecules that store genetic information. They pass
that genetic information to the next generation. Deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) is the nucleic acid that carries information for nearly all living
cells today. DNA has done this for most of Earth's history. Ribonucleic
acid (RNA) delivers genetic instructions to the location in a cell where
protein is synthesized. RNA regulates protein synthesis. Some scientists
think that RNA was the first replicating molecule.

The famous double helix structure of DNA is seen in this animation:
[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/ADN\_animation.gif](ADN_animation.gif)
.

A segment of DNA that is inheritable is a **gene** . Every organism has
a collection of genes that code for the traits that organism could have.
Not all genes are expressed; therefore, knowing all of your genes does
not tell you exactly who you are.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-0us}

-   An organism's metabolism is the chemical reactions that allow it to
    live, grow, and reproduce.
-   Nucleic acids pass genetic information to the next generation.
-   DNA passes genetic information for living cells. RNA passes genetic
    information for protein synthesis.

**Why would an organism match its background? Wouldn't it be better to
stand out?**

An organism that blends with its background is more likely to avoid
predators. If it survives, it is more likely to have offspring. Those
offspring are more likely to blend into their backgrounds. This
butterfly appears to be well adapted to its environment. It is less
likely to be eaten by a bird than a butterfly that stands out against
the tree.

### Variation and Adaptation {#12.html#x-ck12-VmFyaWF0aW9uIGFuZCBBZGFwdGF0aW9u_3-usf}

Every organism is different from every other organism. Every organism's
genes are different, too.

#### Variations {#12.html#x-ck12-VmFyaWF0aW9ucw.._3-jlq}

There are **variations** in the traits of a population. For example,
there are lots of variations in the color of human hair. Hair can be
blonde, brown, black, or even red. Hair color is a trait determined by
genes.

#### Mutations {#12.html#x-ck12-TXV0YXRpb25z_3-93w}

At some time in the past, a variation probably came from a mutation. A
**mutation** is a random change in an organism's genes ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTItMTItYWRhcHRhdGlvbi1jaGFydA..) ).
Mutations are natural. Some are harmful, but many are neutral. If a
mutation is harmful, the organism may not live to reproduce. If the
mutation is beneficial, that organism may have a better chance to
survive. An organism that survives is likely to have offspring. If it
does, it may pass the mutation on to its offspring. The offspring may be
more likely to survive.

#### Adaptations {#12.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnM._3-8ef}

Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive. These
characteristics are called **adaptations** . Some adaptations are better
than others.

Many adaptations protect organisms from the external environment (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTctMDctQ2FjdHVz) ).

Other adaptations help an organism move or gather food. Reindeer have
sponge-like hooves that help them walk on snowy ground without slipping
and falling. Fish at the bottom of the ocean are tiny and use very
little energy because there is very little food. Organisms have special
features that help them avoid being eaten. Some plants have poisonous or
foul-tasting substances in them that keep animals from eating them.
Their brightly colored flowers serve as a warning. The same is true of
some frogs, which can be poisonous ( **Figure**

#### How Adaptations Develop {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IEFkYXB0YXRpb25zIERldmVsb3A._3-20m}

Adaptations develop this way. Think about a population of oak trees.
Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to North America. Most of
the North American oak trees are killed by the fungus. But a few oak
trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus. Those oak
trees are better adapted to the new environment than the others. Those
trees have a better chance of surviving. They will probably reproduce.
The trees may pass on the favorable mutation to their offspring. The
other trees will die. Eventually, the population of oak trees will
change. Most of the trees will have the trait to survive the fungus.
This is an adaptation. Over time, traits that help an organism survive
become more common. Traits that hinder survival eventually disappear.

Thousands of northern elephant seals—some weighing up to 4,500
pounds—make an annual migration to breed each winter at Año Nuevo State
Reserve in California. Marine biologists are using high-tech tools to
explore the secrets of these amazing creatures.

**How did dark deer mice become lighter over time?**

A species changes color over time if its environment changes. Many other
types of changes can take place, too. The darker deer mice evolved into
the lighter deer mice in some locations. What do you think changed about
the environment?

### Biological Evolution {#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvbG9naWNhbCBFdm9sdXRpb24._4-z72}

Adaptations in a species add up over time. These adaptations will mean
that many genes have changed. If the environment is stable, the species
won't change. But if the environment is changing, the species will need
to adapt. Many adaptations may be necessary. In time, the species may
change a lot. The descendants will be very different from their
ancestors. They may even become a new species. This process is called
biological evolution but is usually referred to just as **evolution** .

Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms. We can learn
about this from fossils. For example, horse fossils from 60 million
years ago are very different from modern horses. Ancient horses were
much smaller than they are today ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaW9jZW5lSG9yc2VUcmVl) ). The horses’
teeth and hooves have also changed. The horses evolved because of
changes in their environment.

**Figure 12.9**

Ancient horses were quite different from present-day horses.

</div>

Although basic horse evolution appears to be linear, there were many
more branches. Horse evolution is very well understood.

#### Natural Selection {#12.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBTZWxlY3Rpb24._4-5j0}

Evolution happens because of **natural selection** . Good traits become
more common in a population. Bad traits become less common. The deer
mouse, species *Peromyscus maniculatus* gives an example of evolution by
natural selection. In Nebraska, this mouse is typically brown. But in
places where glaciers dropped lighter sand over the darker soil, the
mice are light. Why? Because predators could more easily spot the dark
mice on light sand. The lighter mice were more likely to survive and
have offspring. Natural selection favored the light mice. Over time, the
population became light colored. Enough changes may take place over time
that the two types of mice become different species.

This story is covered in more detail here:
[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/08/mice-living-in-sand-hills-quickly-evolved-lighter-coloration/]()
.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-q0x}

-   Changes in the genes of a species may result in a new species. This
    is biological evolution.
-   Natural selection can change a species or even make a new species.
    Natural processes favor some traits over others in a population.
    This causes those traits to be more common in
    subsequent generations.
-   Evolution just means change over time.

**How many geese are the right number for this area?**

As many as can survive and have healthy offspring! The figure above
shows a flock of snow geese at the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. Their
population will tend to grow as big as it can for the resources it
needs. Once it is too large, some of its members will die off. This
keeps the population size at the right number.

#### How Populations Grow {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IFBvcHVsYXRpb25zIEdyb3c._5-sgl}

A population usually grows when it has what it needs. If there’s plenty
of food and other resources, the population will get bigger. Refer to
the table below ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6QmFjdGVyaWFsR3Jvd3Ro) ); it shows how a
population of bacteria grew. A single bacteria cell was added to a
container of nutrients. Conditions were ideal. The bacteria divided
every 30 minutes. After just 10 hours, there were more than a million
bacteria! Assume the bacteria population keeps growing at this rate. How
many bacteria will there be at 10.5 hours? Or at 12 hours?

#### Population Growth Rate {#12.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBHcm93dGggUmF0ZQ.._5-1se}

The **population growth rate** is how fast a population is growing. The
letter *r* stands for the growth rate. The growth rate equals the number
of new members added to the population in a year for each 100 members
already in the population. The growth rate includes new members added to
the population and old members removed from the population. Births add
new members to the population. Deaths remove members from the
population. The formula for population growth rate is:

*r* = *b - d* , where

<dl id="x-ck12-ZGZjMGYyNDlmYTZiNDVjNzhhMWRjMDU2ZWFiOTVhOTE.-8mb">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YzU5Y2ZlY2RiYTg1MWU2ZWU5NTU2MmQyZmE5ZTFmNDk.-dhy">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-YzU5Y2ZlY2RiYTg1MWU2ZWU5NTU2MmQyZmE5ZTFmNDk.-74f">
<dd>
*b* = birth rate (number of births in 1 year per 100 population members)

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NjMxNjQwZGQzNmEyMmYyMDYzYjE1NjA1OTA3ZWE1OTc.-rrw">
<dd>
<dl id="x-ck12-NjMxNjQwZGQzNmEyMmYyMDYzYjE1NjA1OTA3ZWE1OTc.-vzu">
<dd>
*d* = death rate (number of deaths in 1 year per 100 population members)

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
If the birth rate is greater than the death rate, *r* is positive. This
means that the population is growing bigger. For example, if *b* = 10
and *d* = 8, *r* = 2. This means that the population is growing by 2
individuals per year for every 100 members of the population. This may
not sound like much, but it’s a fairly high rate of growth. A population
growing at this rate would double in size in just 35 years!

If the birth rate is less than the death rate, *r* is negative. This
means that the population is becoming smaller. What do you think might
cause this to happen?

#### Carrying Capacity {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2FycnlpbmcgQ2FwYWNpdHk._5-nxf}

A population can’t keep growing bigger and bigger forever. Sooner or
later, it will run out of things it needs. For a given species, there is
a maximum population that can be supported by the environment. This
maximum is called the **carrying capacity** . When a population gets
close to the carrying capacity, it usually grows more slowly (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMTUtRW52aXJvbm1lbnQtY2FwYWNpdHk.) ).
When the population reaches the carrying capacity, it stops growing.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-5if}

-   A population will grow as long as it has what it needs.
-   The carrying capacity of an environment is reached when the number
    of births equal the number of deaths.
-   A limiting factor determines the carrying capacity for a species.

**What is next for life on Earth?**

Life is dynamic! Species begin, populations grow, species die out, new
species are born. Extinction is an important part of this. If organisms
never went extinct, there wouldn't be any habitats available for new
ones to arise. What could be next?

### Extinction {#12.html#x-ck12-RXh0aW5jdGlvbg.._6-1zh}

Most of the species that have lived have also gone extinct. There are
two ways to go extinct. The most obvious way is to die out completely.
The other way a species goes extinct is if it evolves into a different
species. Extinction is a normal part of Earth's history. Most of the
organisms that have lived have gone extinct.

Sometimes large numbers of species go extinct in a short amount of time.
This is a **mass extinction** . The causes of different mass extinctions
are different: collisions with comets or asteroids, massive volcanic
eruptions, or rapidly changing climate are all possible causes of some
of these disasters ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UeXJhbm5vc2F1cnVzUmV4) ).

### Adaptive Radiation {#12.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRpdmUgUmFkaWF0aW9u_6-ua5}

After a mass extinction, many habitats are no longer inhabited by
organisms because they have gone extinct. With new habitats available,
some species will adapt to the new environments. Evolutionary processes
act rapidly during these times. Many new species evolve to fill those
available habitats. The process in which many new species evolve in a
short period of time to fill available niches is called **adaptive
radiation** . At the end of this period of rapid evolution, the life
forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass
extinction. One example came after the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life form.
Although they lived in the habitats the dinosaurs had lived in, they
didn't look much like the dinosaurs.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-np2}

-   Species go extinct when all of the individuals die out or evolve
    into a different species.
-   Many species go extinct at roughly the same time during a
    mass extinction.
-   New habitats become available and species evolve to fill them so
    that biodiversity increases during adaptive radiation.

**How fast is human population growing?**

There are more than 7 billion people in the world. As you read this
sentence, at least three more people will be added. Think about that for
second or so, and there’s another three. Why is the human population
growing so fast? Has it always grown this fast? What causes populations
to grow?

### Human Population Numbers {#12.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gUG9wdWxhdGlvbiBOdW1iZXJz_7-qjg}

Bacteria in a dish with ample nutrients double in population until there
is no more space. Every population eventually reaches its maximum size.
The population of bacteria in the dish reaches its carrying capacity.
The **carrying capacity** is the number of an organisms that can live
with the resources that are available. The **limiting factor** for the
bacteria in the dish is space. That's the factor that limits the
population of the bacteria in the dish. If there were unlimited space
then maybe nutrients would be the limiting factor. Some resource will
always run out to limit a population. Let's now apply these concepts to
the human population.

Human population growth over the past 10,000 years has been tremendous (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvMTctMy1uMTY.) ). The entire human
population was estimated to be:

-   5 million in 8000 BC
-   300 million in 1 AD
-   1 billion in 1802
-   3 billion in 1961
-   7 billion in 2011

### The Rate of Growth {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJhdGUgb2YgR3Jvd3Ro_7-d39}

Not only has the population increased, but the rate of population growth
has increased ( **Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTE4MDItMDI.)
). The population was estimated to reach 7 billion in 2012, but it did
so in 2011. This was just 12 years after reaching 6 billion.

</div>

As the human population continues to grow, different factors limit
population in different parts of the world. Space, clean air, clean
water, and food to feed everyone are limiting in some locations.
Worldwide though, human ingenuity has not placed a limit on the
population. Not only does the population increase, the rate of
population growth increases.

There is a sign that population growth is slowing. Although population
continues to grow rapidly, the rate that the growth rate is increasing
has declined. Still, a recent estimate by the United Nations claims that
10.1 billion people will be sharing this planet by the end of the
century. The total added will be about 3 billion people. That number is
more than were even in existence as recently as 1960. Yet that is much
less than the number we would expect if 1 billion people were being
added every 12 years.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-qnw}

-   The human population is growing more than exponentially.
-   The rate of human population growth is still increasing. However,
    the rate at which the rate of growth is increasing has declined.
-   The United Nations estimates a population of 10.1 billion by the end
    of the century.

**Where on the graph are the major population changes?**

Let's look at this graph again. It shows human population from 10,000 BC
through 2000 AD. Where are the big changes in slope of the line? Can you
identify them? In this concept, we'll learn what causes them.

### What Causes Human Populations to Grow? {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBDYXVzZXMgSHVtYW4gUG9wdWxhdGlvbnMgdG8gR3Jvdz8._8-qyr}

Look at the graph above. Human population increased dramatically at
certain times. The graph begins 10,000 BC, although you can't really see
the line. Population starts to rise perceptibly at around 1800 BC. The
numbers begin to rise dramatically about 200 years ago. What causes
these changes?

#### Agricultural Revolution {#12.html#x-ck12-QWdyaWN1bHR1cmFsIFJldm9sdXRpb24._8-bhe}

Farming was developed about 10,000 years ago. Farming meant a steady
supply of food. People could settle in villages. The rise at around 1800
BC is due to increased farming and the rise of cities and towns. The
population rises steadily until around 1800 AD. At that time it shoots
up dramatically. Really dramatically. What happened?

#### Industrial Revolution {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5kdXN0cmlhbCBSZXZvbHV0aW9u_8-ffi}

The **Industrial Revolution** is what happened. The Industrial
Revolution began in the late 1700s in Europe, North America, and a few
other places. Before the Industrial Revolution, most labor was done by
people. The Industrial Revolution changed the source of power from
humans to fossil fuels. This allowed more work to be done and more food
to be grown. People began to move into cities.

Where the Industrial Revolution was taking place, the human population
started to grow really fast. The birth rate was always high. What
changed was the death rate. The population grew because more people
stayed alive. The death rate fell for several reasons:

1.  New farm machines were invented. They increased the amount of food
    that could be produced. With more food, people were healthier and
    could live longer.
2.  Steam engines and railroads were built. These machines could quickly
    carry food long distances. This made food shortages less likely.
3.  Sanitation was improved. Sewers were dug to carry away human wastes
    ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMTctRGlnZ2luZy1Mb25kb24tc2V3ZXI.) ).
    This helped reduce the spread of disease.

Digging a London sewer (1840s). Before 1800, human wastes were thrown
into the streets of cities such as London. In the early 1800s, sewers
were dug to carry away the wastes.

</div>

With better food and less chance of disease, the death rate fell. More
children lived long enough to reach adulthood and have children of their
own. As the death rate fell, the birth rate stayed high for awhile. This
caused rapid population growth.

#### The Green Revolution {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdyZWVuIFJldm9sdXRpb24._8-m63}

The most recent increase in the slope of the population line is because
of another advance in agriculture. The **Green Revolution** began in the
mid-1900s. The Green Revolution has allowed billions of people to be
added to the population in the past few decades. New methods and
products increased how much food could be grown. These advances include:

-   Improving crops by selecting for certain genetic traits. The desired
    traits promote productivity. Recently, genetically engineered crops
    have been introduced.
-   Increasing the use of artificial fertilizers and chemical
    **pesticides** .
-   Increasing the use of agricultural machinery: plowing, tilling,
    fertilizing, picking, and transporting. These machines are powered
    by fossil fuels, rather than humans.
-   Increasing access to water. Many rivers have been dammed. Wells tap
    into many groundwater aquifers.

The Green Revolution has increased the productivity of farms immensely.
A century ago, a single farmer produced enough food for 2.5 people, but
now a farmer can feed more than 130 people. The Green Revolution is
credited for feeding 1 billion people that would not otherwise have been
able to live.

#### The Health Revolution {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEhlYWx0aCBSZXZvbHV0aW9u_8-jmn}

Health care has been improving over the most recent centuries.
**Vaccines** were developed that could prevent many diseases (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Qb2xpb1ZhY2NpbmF0aW9u) ).
**Antibiotics** were discovered that could cure most infections caused
by bacteria. Together, these two advances saved countless lives.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-kll}

-   Farming allowed people to have a steady food source and settle down.
    The Green Revolution has dramatically increased
    agricultural productivity.
-   The Industrial Revolution brought new machinery, increased the food
    supply, and improved sanitation.
-   Vaccinations and antibiotics have greatly improved human health.

**Is life the same for all 7 billion of us?**

Of course not. A minority of people use most of the world’s energy and
other resources. Not only are their needs met, but they have many
luxuries. Many other people lack resources. Many don’t have enough to
eat or live, with the threat of hunger. Many also do not have safe,
clean water. Some people live in crowded, run-down housing. Some people
live in mansions.

### Overpopulation? {#12.html#x-ck12-T3ZlcnBvcHVsYXRpb24__9-opr}

**Overpopulation** takes place when the number of organisms exceeds the
carrying capacity of the region. What is the carrying capacity of Earth
for humans? Are seven billion people the human carrying capacity? Nine
billion? We don't know yet.

It seems that we have increased the carrying capacity of the planet for
humans. We have done this with agriculture and fossil fuels and
improvements in health care. Have we now exceeded Earth's carrying
capacity ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtUmV2LTE4LTQzLU1hbmhhdHRhbg..) )? Are
humans on Earth experiencing overpopulation?

There is not yet an answer to that question. So far, many of us have
skated along without much trouble. But since we depend on resources that
are non-renewable, the answer could well be yes.

population is becoming too high. That’s because we are harming the
environment. Some of the harmful effects of a high human population are:

-   Supplying all those people with energy creates a lot of pollution.
    For example, huge oil spills have killed millions of living things.
-   Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. This also causes
    global warming.
-   Fossil fuels and other resources are being used up. We may run out
    of oil by the mid-2000s. Many other resources will run out sooner
    or later.
-   People are killing too many animals for food. For example, some of
    the best fishing grounds in the oceans have almost no fish left.
-   People have destroyed many habitats. For example, they’ve drained
    millions of acres of wetlands. Wetlands have a great diversity
    of species. As wetlands shrink, species go extinct.
-   People have introduced **invasive species** - species originally
    from a different area—to invade new habitats. The introduction can
    be intentional or accidental. Often, the aliens have no natural
    enemies in their new home. They may drive native species extinct. In
    the mid-1900s, Australian tree snakes invaded Guam and other islands
    in the Pacific. The snakes stowed away on boats and planes. Tree
    snakes had no natural enemies on the islands so their
    population exploded. The snakes have caused the extinction of nine
    of the eleven native bird species on Guam ( **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ccm93blRyZWVTbmFrZQ..) ).

-   People themselves are also affected by the large size of the
    human population. Some people have a lot; some have very little.
    Many people refer to the abundance of luxury items in some people’s
    lives as **over-consumption** . People in developed nations use 32
    times more resources than people in the developing countries of
    the world. The symbol of this is CO ~2~ emissions, which are a waste
    product from fossil fuel burning. Populations that burn the most
    fossil fuels have a high standard of living.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-tur}

-   Supporting 7 billion people is taking an environmental toll on
    the planet.
-   Pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species are a few of
    the problems caused by the high population.
-   Over-consumption means that some people use a much larger amount of
    the resources than others.

**Does the world seem crowded?**

In some places, there seem to be people everywhere. Times Square in New
York City is definitely one of those places. In other places, there are
hardly any people at all. Does that mean that the world is not
overpopulated? Is space all that people need?

### Growth Rates Around the World {#12.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIFJhdGVzIEFyb3VuZCB0aGUgV29ybGQ._10-4xp}

With ample food, better health, and easier work, people live longer.
Children are much more likely to reach adulthood and have their own
children. In many countries, death rates have gone down dramatically,
but birth rates remain high. This means that the population is growing.
Pictured below is the growth rates of human populations all over the
world ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Xb3JsZFBvcHVsYXRpb25Hcm93dGg.) ).

wealthiest countries or the poorest countries?

</div>

### The Future {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZ1dHVyZQ.._10-w5o}

Human ingenuity has allowed the population to continue to grow. We’ve
increased Earth's **carrying capacity** for humans by our genius. We
grow crops, trade for needed materials, and design ways to exploit
resources that are difficult to get at, such as groundwater. We use
long-buried ancient organisms for fuel. We have broken the rules for
biological populations.

Of course, there's a flip side to this. For the population to continue
to grow, more advances in agriculture will be needed. The best lands are
already in use. Most rivers that can be dammed, have been dammed. In
many aquifers, groundwater is not replenished on the time frame needed.
Fossil fuels too are limited. Obtaining fossil fuels or developing new
power sources will be more costly.

#### Future Population Growth {#12.html#x-ck12-RnV0dXJlIFBvcHVsYXRpb24gR3Jvd3Ro_10-k8g}

The rate of increase of the growth rate of the human population is
decreasing ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMjAtSHVtYW4tcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1ncmFwaA..)
). The population may stop growing by the mid 2000s. Some scientists
think that the human population will peak at about 9 billion people.
What will need to change for the population to stop growing then?

**Is there another way?**

Visibility in Beijing is sometimes so bad that the airport must be
closed due to smog. In their rush to develop, many nations are making
the same mistakes that the developed nations have already made. Can
everyone find a more sustainable path?

### Sustainable Development {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VzdGFpbmFibGUgRGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ._11-puh}

Is it possible for all the world’s people to live well and still protect
the planet? That’s the aim of **sustainable development** . Its goals
are to:

1.  help people out of poverty.
2.  protect the environment.
3.  use resources no faster than the rate at which they are regenerated.

A smaller human population is part of the solution. Studies show that
educated women have fewer and healthier, children. Educating women (and
men) is a long-term goal of population control.

Developing new technologies can help. For example, fish farming can feed
people good healthy protein. The farming must be done in an
environmentally sound way.

Better use of resources is another part. For example, when forests are
logged, new trees should be planted.

Citizens can change their behavior to reduce the impact they have on the
planet. They can demand that products are produced sustainably. People
can consume less. They can think about the impact they have when they do
consume.

Everyone can help in the effort. What will you do?

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-9qm}

-   Sustainable development tries to bring people up to certain minimum
    living conditions. This must be done without doing further damage to
    the environment.
-   To develop sustainably, the human population must stabilize
    or decrease.
-   Resources must be developed and used consciously and in
    environmentally sound ways.

**Where can you find an ecosystem?**

Just about everywhere you could go in nature, you would be taking a
field trip to an ecosystem. There are underwater ecosystems and coastal
ecosystems. There are small scale ecosystems and large ones. There are
even ecosystems inside your body!

### What Is an Ecosystem? {#12.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBhbiBFY29zeXN0ZW0__12-2am}

An **ecosystem** is a group of living things and their environment. The
word ecosystem is short for “ecological system.” Like any system, an
ecosystem is a group of parts that work together. You can see examples
of ecosystems in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDEtVHdvLWVjb3N5c3RlbXM.) . The
forest pictured is a big ecosystem. Besides trees, what living things do
you think are part of the forest ecosystem? The dead tree stump in the
same forest is a small ecosystem. It includes plants, mosses, and fungi.
It also includes insects and worms.

An ecosystem can be big or small. A small ecosystem can be part of a
larger ecosystem.

</div>

#### Abiotic Factors {#12.html#x-ck12-QWJpb3RpYyBGYWN0b3Jz_12-bmb}

**Abiotic factors** are the nonliving parts of ecosystems. They include
air, sunlight, soil, water, and minerals. These are all things that are
needed for life. They determine which living things—and how many of
them—an ecosystem can support. Pictured below is an ecosystem and its
abiotic factors ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDItQWJpb3RpYy1mYWN0b3Jz) ).

**Figure 12.22**

Which abiotic factors do you see here?

</div>

#### Biotic Factors {#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvdGljIEZhY3RvcnM._12-e9z}

**Biotic factors** are the living parts of ecosystems. They are the
species of living things that reside together.

#### Species, Niche, and Habitat {#12.html#x-ck12-U3BlY2llcywgTmljaGUsIGFuZCBIYWJpdGF0_12-tq9}

A **species** is a unique type of organism. Members of a species can
interbreed and produce offspring that can breed (they are fertile).
Organisms that are not in the same species cannot do this. Examples of
species include humans, lions, and redwood trees. Can you name other
examples?

Each species has a particular way of making a living. This is called its
**niche** . You can see the niche of a lion below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDMtTGlvbi1odW50cy16ZWJyYQ..) ). A
lion makes its living by hunting and eating other animals. Each species
also has a certain place where it is best suited to live. This is called
its **habitat** . The lion’s habitat is a grassland. Why is a lion
better off in a grassland than in a forest?

</div>

#### Living Together {#12.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIFRvZ2V0aGVy_12-cqg}

All the members of a species that live in the same area form a
**population** . Many different species live together in an ecosystem.
All their populations make up a **community** . What populations live
together in the grassland pictured below ( **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDMtTGlvbi1odW50cy16ZWJyYQ..) )?

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-xko}

-   All of the individuals of a species that exist together at a given
    place and time make up a population. A community is made up of all
    of the populations in an area.
-   The living and nonliving factors that living organisms need plus the
    communities of organisms themselves make up an ecosystem.
-   A habitat is where an organism lives, and a niche is what it does to
    make a living.

**Can you pick out the organisms at the bottom and at the top of this
food chain?**

What's at the bottom of the food chain? A bit of the food energy comes
from above, where plankton photosynthesize. Most comes from the coral.
Coral are animals that live with tiny zooxanthellae that also
photosynthesize. Of course, you know what's at the top of this food
chain!

### Roles in Ecosystems {#12.html#x-ck12-Um9sZXMgaW4gRWNvc3lzdGVtcw.._13-zpx}

All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles. Some
organisms must be producers. Others must be consumers. Decomposers are
also important.

#### Producers {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJvZHVjZXJz_13-rol}

**Producers** are living things that use energy to make food. Producers
make food for themselves and other living things. There are two types of
producers:

-   By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to
    make food. This is called **photosynthesis** . Producers that
    photosynthesize include plants and algae. These organisms must live
    where there is plenty of sunlight.
-   Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food. This is
    called **chemosynthesis** . Only a very few producers are of this
    type, and all of them are microbes. These producers live deep under
    the ocean where there is no sunlight. An example is pictured below (
    **Figure**
    [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDQtT2NlYW4tZmxvb3ItZWNvc3lzdGVt) ).

**Consumers** can’t make their own food. Consumers must eat producers or
other consumers. Listed below are the three main types of consumers (
**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDUtVHlwZXMtb2YtY29uc3VtZXJz) ):
**herbivores** , **carnivores** , and **omnivores** . Which type are
you?

Consumers get their food in different ways ( **Figure**

). **Grazers** feed on living organisms without killing them. A rabbit
nibbles on leaves, and a mosquito sucks a drop of blood. **Predators** ,
like lions, capture and kill animals for food. The animals they eat are
called **prey** . Even some plants are consumers. Pitcher plants trap
insects in their sticky fluid in their “pitchers.” The insects are their
prey. **Scavengers** eat animals that are already dead. This hyena is
eating the remains of a lion’s prey. **Decomposers** break down dead
organisms and the wastes of living things ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDYtV2F5cy1jb25zdW1lcnMtZ2V0LWZvb2Q.)
). This dung beetle is rolling a ball of dung (animal waste) back to its
nest. The beetle will use the dung to feed its young. The mushrooms
pictured are growing on a dead log. They will slowly break it down. This
releases its nutrients to the soil.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-2of}

-   Herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat meat, and omnivores eat both.
-   Predators are animals that eat a prey animal. Scavengers eat
    organisms that are already dead. Decomposers break down dead plants
    and animals into component parts, including nutrients.
-   Producers create food energy. They are the base of all life
    on Earth. Most producers use photosynthesis but a very small number
    use chemosynthesis.

**What is the source of energy for almost all ecosystems?**

The Sun supports most of Earth's ecosystems. Plants create chemical
energy from abiotic factors that include solar energy. The food energy
created by producers is passed through the food chain.

### How Energy Flows Through Ecosystems {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVuZXJneSBGbG93cyBUaHJvdWdoIEVjb3N5c3RlbXM._14-rzk}

All living things need energy. They need it to power the processes of
life. For example, it takes energy to grow. It also takes energy to
produce offspring. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Remember
that energy can’t be created or destroyed. It can only change form.
Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems.

#### The Flow of Energy {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZsb3cgb2YgRW5lcmd5_14-jsa}

Most ecosystems get their energy from the Sun. Only producers can use
sunlight to make usable energy. Producers convert the sunlight into
chemical energy or food. Consumers get some of that energy when they eat
producers. They also pass some of the energy on to other consumers when
they are eaten. In this way, energy flows from one living thing to
another.

#### Food Chains {#12.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBDaGFpbnM._14-3ww}

A **food chain** is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows
through an ecosystem. Pictured below is an example of a food chain (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDYtRm9vZC1jaGFpbg..) ).
Producers form the base of all food chains. The consumers that eat
producers are called primary consumers. The consumers that eat primary
consumers are secondary consumers. This chain can continue to multiple
levels.

**Figure 12.27**

What do the arrows stand for in a food chain?

</div>

At each level of a food chain, a lot of energy is lost. Only about ten
percent of the energy passes to the next level. Where does that energy
go? Some energy is given off as heat. Some energy goes into animal
wastes. Energy also goes into growing things that another consumer can't
eat, like fur. It's because so much energy is lost that most food chains
have just a few levels. There’s not enough energy left for higher
levels.

#### Food Webs {#12.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBXZWJz_14-nk6}

Food chains are too simple to represent the real world. They don’t show
all the ways that energy flows through an ecosystem. A more complex
diagram is called a **food web** ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDctRm9vZC13ZWI.) ). A food web
consists of many overlapping food chains. Can you identify the food
chains in the figure? How many food chains include the mouse?

**What happens when you don't get enough of a nutrient?**

Millions of sailors in the 15th through 18th centuries died
mysteriously. They developed a disease called scurvy. The scurvy, it
turns out, was due to the lack of vitamin C in their diets. It wasn't
until 1932 that the link between scurvy and vitamin C was made. Without
the right nutrients in the right amounts, you can't live. Other animals
and plants also need the right nutrients to live.

### How Matter Moves Through Ecosystems {#12.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1hdHRlciBNb3ZlcyBUaHJvdWdoIEVjb3N5c3RlbXM._15-3kj}

Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy. What do you think
matter is used for? It's used to build bodies. It's also needed to carry
out the processes of life. Any nonliving matter that living things need
is called a **nutrient** . Carbon and nitrogen are examples of
nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. In the
figure below, you can see how ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMDgtRW5lcmd5LWluLWVjb3N5c3RlbQ..) ).

-   Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms.
-   The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots.
-   The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants.
-   The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower
    level consumers.
-   When living things die, the cycle repeats.

This diagram shows two cycles. One is the cycle of energy, the other is
the cycle of matter. Compare the two cycles. Do you see how the Sun

cycle. Matter doesn’t have to be added. Can you explain why?

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-jkv}

-   Nutrients are crucial to the growth of organisms.
-   Decomposers break down dead organisms into nutrients and gases so
    that they can be used by other organisms.

**Why are these fish dead?**

In a dead zone, there is so little oxygen that fish can't live. What
causes the oxygen to disappear? Indirectly, it's nitrogen.

### The Nitrogen Cycle {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE5pdHJvZ2VuIEN5Y2xl_16-xxm}

Living things need nitrogen. Nitrogen is a key element in proteins. Like
carbon, nitrogen cycles through ecosystems. The **nitrogen cycle** is
pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMTItTml0cm9nZW4tY3ljbGU.) ).

The nitrogen cycle includes air, soil, and living things.

</div>

#### Fixing Nitrogen {#12.html#x-ck12-Rml4aW5nIE5pdHJvZ2Vu_16-34b}

Air is about 78 percent nitrogen. Decomposers release nitrogen into the
air from dead organisms and their wastes. However, producers such as
plants can’t use these forms of nitrogen. Nitrogen must combine with
other elements before producers can use it. This is done by certain
bacteria in the soil. It’s called “fixing” nitrogen.

#### Human Actions and the Nitrogen Cycle {#12.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gQWN0aW9ucyBhbmQgdGhlIE5pdHJvZ2VuIEN5Y2xl_16-jzq}

Nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients needed by plants. That’s
why most plant fertilizers contain nitrogen. Adding fertilizer to soil
allows more plants to grow. As a result, a given amount of land can
produce more food. So far, so good. But what happens next?

Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The
fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is
a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes
algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with
algae ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMTMtVG9vLW11Y2gtbml0cm9nZW4tZWZmZWN0cw..)
). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die,
decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the
oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A **dead zone** is an
area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little
oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTgtMTMtVG9vLW11Y2gtbml0cm9nZW4tZWZmZWN0cw..)
). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the
Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water
carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-fu9}

-   Nitrogen is an essential part of many molecules needed by
    living organisms.
-   Nitrogen is fixed when it is changed into a form that organisms
    can use.
-   Dead zones come about when excess nitrogen in the water causes algae
    to grow out of control. Decomposers use oxygen to decompose the
    algae when they die. The lack of oxygen makes it impossible for
    other organisms to live in that zone.

**What do the swamps of Florida look like?**

Orlando, Florida is home to many amusement parks. On the left is a swamp
with swamp wildlife. On the right is the village of Hogsmeade, or at
least a replica. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is one of the many
amusement parks in and around Orlando. These amusement parks are built
on land that was mostly lakes and swamps.

### Freshwater Ecosystems {#12.html#x-ck12-RnJlc2h3YXRlciBFY29zeXN0ZW1z_17-7yx}

Lakes, ponds, streams, springs, and wetlands are fresh water bodies. The
organisms that live in them are part of freshwater ecosystems. These
ecosystems vary by temperature, pressure (in lakes), and the amount of
light that penetrates. The type of plants that grow in these ecosystems
varies.

#### Lake Ecosystems {#12.html#x-ck12-TGFrZSBFY29zeXN0ZW1z_17-reh}

**Limnology** is the study of the plants and animals that live in fresh
water bodies. A lake has zones just like the ocean. The ecosystem of a
lake is divided into three distinct zones ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTEzLTAyLTA2) ):

1.  The surface (littoral) zone is the sloped area closest to the edge
    of the water.
2.  The open-water zone (also called the **photic zone** ) has sunlight.
3.  The deep-water zone (also called the **aphotic zone** ) has little
    or no sunlight.

There are several life zones found within a lake:

-   In the **littoral zone** , sunlight allows plants to grow. Plants
    provide food and shelter to animals such as snails, insects,
    and fish.
-   Other plants and fish live in the open-water zone. These include
    bass and trout.
-   The deep-water zone is dark so there is no photosynthesis. Most
    deep-water organisms are scavengers. They feed on dead organisms
    that fall to the bottom of the lake. Crabs and catfish are two of
    these types of organisms. Fungi and bacteria are decomposers that
    live in the deep zone.

#### Wetlands {#12.html#x-ck12-V2V0bGFuZHM._17-0v6}

Some of Earth’s freshwater is found in wetlands. A **wetland** is an
area that is covered with water, or at least has very soggy soil, during
all or part of the year. Certain species of plants thrive in wetlands,
and they are rich ecosystems. Freshwater wetlands are usually found at
the edges of streams, rivers, ponds, or lakes. Wetlands can also be
found at the edges of seas.

#### Types of Freshwater Wetlands {#12.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgRnJlc2h3YXRlciBXZXRsYW5kcw.._17-j7t}

Not all wetlands are alike, as you can see below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTMtMDktV2V0bGFuZHM.) ). Wetlands vary
in how wet they are and how much of the year they are soaked. Wetlands
also vary in the kinds of plants that live in them. This depends mostly
on the climate where the wetland is found. Types of wetlands include
marshes, swamps, and bogs.

-   A **marsh** is a wetland that is usually under water. It has grassy
    plants, such as cattails.
-   A **swamp** is a wetland that may or may not be covered with water
    but is always soggy. It has shrubs or trees.
-   A **bog** is a wetland that has soggy soil. It is generally covered
    with mosses.

</div>

#### Importance of Wetlands {#12.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBXZXRsYW5kcw.._17-o3u}

People used to think that wetlands were useless. Many wetlands were
filled in with rocks and soil to create solid land. This land was then
developed with roads, golf courses, and buildings. Now we know that
wetlands are very important. Laws have been passed to help protect them.
Why are wetlands so important?

-   Wetlands have great biodiversity. They provide homes or breeding
    sites to a huge variety of species. Because so much wetland area has
    been lost, many of these species are endangered.
-   Wetlands purify water. They filter sediments and toxins from runoff
    before it enters rivers, lakes, and oceans.
-   Wetlands slow rushing water. During hurricanes and other extreme
    weather, wetlands reduce the risk of floods.

Although the rate of loss has slowed, wetlands are still being destroyed
today.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-afn}

-   The conditions that affect lake ecosystems are similar to those that
    affect ocean ecosystems. These include light penetration,
    temperature, and water depth.
-   Wetlands are lands that are wet for a significant portion of
    the year.
-   Wetlands are extremely important as an ecosystem and as a filter
    for pollutants.

**How can you visit marine life?**

It's easiest to get to the relatively shallow seafloor just offshore.
Experienced divers can descend to 130 feet (43 ft), which gives them
access to most marine life. Manned submersibles can descend to the
bottom of the deep ocean. Where would you like to go? A coral reef or a
hydrothermal vent?

### Living Things in the Ocean {#12.html#x-ck12-TGl2aW5nIFRoaW5ncyBpbiB0aGUgT2NlYW4._18-isz}

Marine organisms range in size from tiny bacteria to the largest known
animal, the blue whale. All are adapted for life in salt water. Most are
adapted for extreme pressures.

When you think of life in the ocean, do you think of fish? Actually,
fish are not the most common life forms in the ocean. Plankton are the
most common. Plankton make up one of three major groups of marine life.
The other two groups are nekton and benthos ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMjQtUGxhbmt0b24tTmVrdG9uLUJlbnRob3MtbmV3)
).

**Figure 12.34**

Living things in the oceans are placed in these three groups.

</div>

#### Plankton {#12.html#x-ck12-UGxhbmt0b24._18-oum}

**Plankton** are living things that float in the water. Most plankton
are too small to see with the unaided eye ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QbGFua3Rvbg..) ). Plankton are unable
to move on their own. Ocean motions carry them along.

There are two main types of plankton:

1.  **Phytoplankton** are “plant-like” plankton. Since they make food by
    photosynthesis, they live in the photic zone. Most are algae.
2.  **Zooplankton** are “animal-like” plankton that include tiny animals
    and fish larvae. They feed on phytoplankton.

magnified. Otherwise, they would be too small for you to see.

</div>

#### Nekton {#12.html#x-ck12-TmVrdG9u_18-ir3}

**Nekton** are living things that swim through the water ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OZWt0b24.) ). They may live at any
depth, in the photic or aphotic zone. Most nekton are fish, although
some are mammals. Fish have fins and streamlined bodies to help them
swim. Fish also have gills to take oxygen from the water.

#### Benthos {#12.html#x-ck12-QmVudGhvcw.._18-ybj}

**Benthos** are living organisms on the ocean floor. Many benthic
organisms attach themselves to rocks and stay in one place. This
protects them from crashing waves and other water movements. Some
benthic organisms burrow into sediments for food or protection. Benthic
animals may crawl over the ocean floor. Examples of benthos include
clams and worms. Pictured below are two other examples ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMjctQmVudGhvcw..) ).

example ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMjgtVHViZXdvcm1zLUJlbnRob3M.) ).
Scalding hot water pours out of the vents. The hot water contains
chemicals that some specialized bacteria can use to make food. Tubeworms
have the bacteria living inside them. The bacteria get protection and
the tubeworms get some of the food.

**What's the most unusual life form you could see on Earth?**

Some people might disagree. But the most unusual life on Earth could be
the strange organisms that live at hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean
ridges. These organisms break down chemicals to make food energy. They
engage in chemosynthesis. Would you like to see an ecosystem with
chemosynthesis at its base?

### Marine Food Chains {#12.html#x-ck12-TWFyaW5lIEZvb2QgQ2hhaW5z_19-ibq}

Pictured below is a marine food chain ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMjktTWFyaW5lLWZvb2QtY2hhaW4.) ).
Phytoplankton form the base of the food chain. Phytoplankton are the
most important primary producers in the ocean. They use sunlight and
nutrients to make food by **photosynthesis** . Small zooplankton consume
phytoplankton. Larger organisms eat the small zooplankton. Larger
predators eat these consumers. In an unusual relationship, some enormous
whales depend on plankton for their food. They filter tremendous amounts
of these tiny creatures out of the water.

**Figure 12.39**

Many marine food chains look like this example.

</div>

The bacteria that make food from chemicals are also primary producers.
These organisms do not do photosynthesis since there is no light at the
vents. They do something called **chemosynthesis** . They break down
chemicals to make food.

When marine organisms die, decomposers break them down. This returns
their nutrients to the water. The nutrients can be used again to make
food. Decomposers in the oceans include bacteria and worms. Many live on
the ocean floor. Do you know why?

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-4tf}

-   Photosynthesis is the base of nearly all food chains on Earth. This
    is true of marine food chains, too.
-   In chemosynthesis, organisms break down chemicals to make
    food energy.
-   As on land, marine decomposers break down dead organisms. They
    release nutrients.

**What would a field trip into the ocean reveal?**

There are all sorts of incredible life forms in the seas! Most live near
the surface or come up to the surface. Some live very far below the
surface and never come up. All are well adapted to their watery
environment.

### The Intertidal {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEludGVydGlkYWw._20-zz6}

Have you been to a rocky shore and seen the **intertidal** ? It's the
zone at the beach that is covered when the tide is up and uncovered when
the tide is out. An abundance of life is found there, but it's a
difficult place to live. Conditions change rapidly. Waves pound and the
tide goes in and out ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy0xMC0wOC0wMC1UaWRlcG9vbC1DcmVhdHVyZXM.) ).

</div>

Many animals in the intertidal live in tide pools. What specific
adaptations do they have to that zone? The mussels on the top left have
hard shells. These protect them from waves and from drying out. The sea
anemones in the lower right are more often submerged. They can close up
during low tides. Both types of organisms have strong attachments so
they don't wash out to sea.

Many young organisms get their start in estuaries and so they must be
adapted to rapid shifts in salinity.

### Reefs {#12.html#x-ck12-UmVlZnM._20-0p2}

Corals and other animals create limestone rock **reefs** near the shore.
Coral reefs are the “rainforests of the oceans.” They have a tremendous
amount of species diversity ( **Figure**

Reefs can form interesting shapes in the oceans. Remember that there are
many volcanoes in the ocean. Coral reefs can form on volcanoes in
tropical water. Since the volcanoes are cones, the reef forms in a
circle around the volcano. Eventually the volcano becomes inactive. The
mountain subsides and erodes so that it is below sea level. This leaves
a circular coral reef ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTQtNDgtTWF1cGl0aS1Jc2xhbmQ.) ).

### Oceanic Zone {#12.html#x-ck12-T2NlYW5pYyBab25l_20-yrm}

The open ocean is a vast area. Food washes down from the land. Food is
also created by photosynthesizing plankton. Zooplankton and larger
animals feed on the phytoplankton and on each other. Larger animals such
as whales and giant groupers may live their entire lives in the open
water.

In the deepest ocean, survival is almost impossible ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTQtNDktQW5nbGVyLWZpc2g.) ). It’s very
rare to find a meal, so the fish there use very little energy. They are
very small. The fish move very little and breathe slowly. Missing a meal
could be deadly, so the fish have interesting ways of getting and
keeping food. Some species have jaws that unhinge to accept a larger
fish. Some have backward-folding teeth to keep prey from escaping.

### Hydrothermal Vents {#12.html#x-ck12-SHlkcm90aGVybWFsIFZlbnRz_20-zg0}

**Hydrothermal vents** are among the most unusual ecosystems on Earth.
They are located at mid-ocean ridges where water is extremely hot. The
food source for these ecosystems is chemosynthesis ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTQtMjgtVHViZXdvcm1z) ). This ecosystem
is entirely separate from the photosynthesis at the surface. Shrimp,
clams, fish, and giant tube worms have been found in these extreme
places.

Giant tube worms are found at hydrothermal vents. They get food from the
chemosynthetic bacteria that live within them. The bacteria provide
food; the worms provide shelter.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-exp}

-   Life in the intertidal is difficult, but there are many types of
    organisms there.
-   There are few organisms that live in the deepest ocean. The ones
    that do have amazing adaptations to the exceptionally
    harsh conditions.
-   A hydrothermal vent ecosystem has chemosynthesis as its food source.
    The ecosystem is independent of photosynthesis at the surface.

**What would you see if you could go back 4.5 billion years?**

If you took a field trip back in time to the earliest Earth, things
would be very different. Everything would be very hot. What company
would you have? Maybe some simple microbes. Maybe not.

### Ancient Life {#12.html#x-ck12-QW5jaWVudCBMaWZl_21-gyu}

For the first 4 billion years of Earth history there is only a little
evidence of life. Organisms were tiny and soft and did not fossilize
well. But scientists use a variety of ways to figure out what this early
life was like. Note that the period from Earth's origin to the beginning
of the Phanerozoic is called the Precambrian.

#### Life Begins {#12.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBCZWdpbnM._21-y5b}

Life probably began in the oceans. No one knows exactly how or when.
Life may have originated more than once. If life began before the Moon
formed, that impact would have wiped it out. Then life would have had to
originate again. Eventually conditions on Earth became less violent. The
planet could support life.

The first organisms were made of only one cell ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-RUNvbGk.) ). The earliest cells were
**prokaryotes** . Prokaryotic cells are surrounded by a cell membrane.
They do not have a nucleus. Their organelles are free in the cell. The
cells get their nutrients directly from the water they live in. The
cells need to use these nutrients to live and grow.

**Figure 12.45**

E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a primitive prokaryote that may resemble
the earliest cells.

</div>

The cells also needed to be able to make copies of themselves. To do
this they stored genetic information in **nucleic acids** . The two
nucleic acids are **DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid) and **RNA**
(ribonucleic acid). Nucleic acids pass genetic instructions to the next
generation.

#### Oxygen Enters the Atmosphere {#12.html#x-ck12-T3h5Z2VuIEVudGVycyB0aGUgQXRtb3NwaGVyZQ.._21-ppo}

Early cells took nutrients from the water. Eventually the nutrients
would have become less abundant.

Around 3 billion years ago, photosynthesis began. Organisms could make
their own food from sunlight and inorganic molecules. From these
ingredients they made chemical energy that they used. Oxygen is a waste
product of photosynthesis. That first oxygen combined with iron to
create iron oxide. As more oxygen was produced, the gas entered the
atmosphere.

Some of the oxygen in the atmosphere became ozone. The ozone layer
formed to protect Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. This made
the environment able to support more complex life forms.

#### Early Organisms {#12.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgT3JnYW5pc21z_21-zb9}

The first organisms to photosynthesize were **cyanobacteria** . These
organisms may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years.
Cyanobacteria are still alive today ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-U3Ryb21hdG9saXRlcw..) ). Now they are called
blue-green algae. They are common in lakes and seas, and they account
for 20% to 30% of photosynthesis today.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-zfs}

-   A prokaryote has a cell membrane but otherwise organelles are loose
    within the cell.
-   Photosynthesis allows organisms to produce food energy with oxygen
    as a by-product. After photosynthesis evolved, iron oxidized and
    then oxygen entered the atmosphere. Ozone was created in the
    upper atmosphere.
-   Cyanobacteria, which are still around today, were the earliest known
    photosynthesizing organisms.

**If you could go back to the late Precambrian, would you recognize
these as ancestors of modern life?**

This is a depiction of *Dickinsonia costata* , a member of the Ediacara
fauna. No one knows quite how to categorize these organisms. Some
scientists think that they are the ancestors of modern life. But most
scientists believe that the Ediacara fauna died out and that other
organisms were the ancestors of modern life. If you could go back in
time maybe you could figure it out. But since that isn't possible, is
there any way to really know?

### Life Gets More Complex {#12.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBHZXRzIE1vcmUgQ29tcGxleA.._22-afh}

Eukaryotes evolved about 2 billion years ago. Unlike prokaryotes,
**eukaryotes** have a cell nucleus. They have more structures and are
better organized. Organelles within a eukaryote can perform certain
functions. Some supply energy; some break down wastes. Eukaryotes were
better able to live and so became the dominant life form. You can see an
example of a eukaryotic cell below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FdWthcnlvdGljQ2VsbA..) ).

### Multicellular Life Originates {#12.html#x-ck12-TXVsdGljZWxsdWxhciBMaWZlIE9yaWdpbmF0ZXM._22-4zw}

For life to become even more complex, multicellular organisms needed to
evolve. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes can be multicellular.

Toward the end of the Precambrian, the Ediacara fauna evolved (
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItMzQtRWRpYWNhcmE.) ). The
Ediacara fauna was extremely diverse. The organisms appeared after Earth
defrosted from a worldwide glaciation. The Ediacara fauna seems to have
died out without leaving descendants. Other multicellular organisms
appeared in the Phanerozoic.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-zpq}

-   Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. They also have
    well-developed structures.
-   Eukaryotes did not evolve until 2 billion years ago.
-   Ediacara organisms probably went extinct. Other organisms were the
    ancestors to modern life.

**Does this look like the Earth you know?**

It's not hard to take a field trip to see some ancient life. Horseshoe
crabs live along the east coast of the United States and elsewhere.
These ancient creatures have been more-or-less unchanged for the past
450 million years. This is indicated by fossils. That doesn't get them
quite back to the beginning of the Paleozoic but close. So hundreds of
millions of generations of horseshoe crabs have seen most of the
Phanerozoic go by.

### Phanerozoic Eon {#12.html#x-ck12-UGhhbmVyb3pvaWMgRW9u_23-z7g}

The **Phanerozoic Eon** is divided into three eras—the **Paleozoic** ,
the **Mesozoic** , and the **Cenozoic** ( **Figure** (
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtbGlmZQ..) ). They
span from about 540 million years ago to the present. We live now in the
Cenozoic Era.

Earth’s climate changed numerous times during the Phanerozoic Eon. At
the end of the Precambrian, much of the planet was covered with
glaciers. At the start of the Phanerozoic Eon, the climate became warm
and humid. Since then Earth’s climate has gone through four cycles of
frigid glaciers and warm tropical seas. Some organisms survive changes
in the climate. Others go extinct when the climate changes too much.

#### Phanerozoic Time Line {#12.html#x-ck12-UGhhbmVyb3pvaWMgVGltZSBMaW5l_23-frs}

The table below ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtbGlmZQ..) ) shows
some of the life forms that developed during the Phanerozoic Eon. Life
gradually became more diverse and new species appeared. Most modern
organisms evolved from species that are now extinct.

**Okay, so you wouldn't recognize the Precambrian. How about the
Paleozoic?**

Probably not. You'd see things like these bizarre animals. The creature
on the left is much like a large arthropod. The creature on the right
had five eyes, and a long nose like a vacuum cleaner hose. These
creatures were found as fossils in the Burgess shale.

### Paleozoic Era {#12.html#x-ck12-UGFsZW96b2ljIEVyYQ.._24-9vs}

The first period of the Paleozoic Era was the Cambrian. By the beginning
of the Paleozoic, organisms evolved shells. Shells could hold their soft
tissues together. Shells could protect them from predators and from
drying out. Some organisms evolved external skeletons. These are called
**exoskeletons** . Organisms with hard parts also make good fossils.
Fossils from the Cambrian are much more abundant than fossils from the
Precambrian.

#### The Cambrian Explosion {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENhbWJyaWFuIEV4cGxvc2lvbg.._24-fyj}

The warm, humid climate of the early Cambrian was good for life. There
was a tremendous increase in diversity. There was also an amazing
increase in the number of living things. For these two reasons, this
time period is called the Cambrian Explosion.

With so much diversity, complex ecosystems could develop. All of this
life was in the seas.

#### The Paleozoic Continues {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBhbGVvem9pYyBDb250aW51ZXM._24-fzc}

Paleozoic seas were full of worms, snails, clams, trilobites, sponges,
and brachiopods. Organisms with shells were common.

The first fish were simple, armored, jawless fish. Fish have internal
skeletons. Some, like sharks, skates, and rays, have skeletons of
cartilage. More advanced fish have skeletons of bones. Fish evolved jaws
and many other adaptations for ocean life. Pictured below is some of the
diversity of Earth's oceans ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NdWRza2lwcGVy) ).

#### Moving onto Land {#12.html#x-ck12-TW92aW5nIG9udG8gTGFuZA.._24-zwa}

An organism that lives in water is supported by the water. It does not
need strong support structures. It also does not need to be protected
against drying out. This is not true of land. Moving from the seas to
land required many adaptations.

Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years. By about 450
million years ago, plants began to appear on land. Once there were land
plants, animals had a source of food and shelter. To move to land,
animals needed strong skeletons. They needed protection from drying out.
They needed to be able to breathe air. Eventually they had skeletons,
lungs, and the other the adaptations they needed moved onto the land.

### Mass Extinctions {#12.html#x-ck12-TWFzcyBFeHRpbmN0aW9ucw.._24-whr}

The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by **mass extinctions** .
During these events, large numbers of organisms became extinct very
rapidly. There have been several extinctions in the Phanerozoic. Two
mass extinctions stand out more than the others. One took place at the
end of the Paleozoic. The other took place at the end of the Mesozoic.

#### Permian Extinction {#12.html#x-ck12-UGVybWlhbiBFeHRpbmN0aW9u_24-sdc}

Between the Paleozoic Era and the Mesozoic Era was the largest mass
extinction known. At the end of the Permian, nearly 95% of all marine
species died off. In addition, 70% of land species became extinct. No
one knows the cause of this extinction. Some scientists blame an
asteroid impact. Other scientists think it was a gigantic volcanic
eruption. It is possible that multiple things went wrong for life at the
same time. The environment was changing, an asteroid impacted, and a
giant volcanic eruption took place.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-h1u}

-   In the Cambrian there was an explosion of life. This explosion was
    in number and in diversity.
-   At the beginning of the Paleozoic, all life was in the seas. Later
    in the Paleozoic, life colonized the land.
-   To colonize land, animals need to be able to keep
    themselves together. They need to keep from drying out. They need to
    be able to breathe air.
-   At the end of the Permian was the largest known extinction in
    Earth history.

**Would Mesozoic Earth look familiar?**

The Precambrian and Paleozoic Earth would probably not be recognizable.
How about if you visited the Mesozoic? The planet would look a lot more
like it does today. Animals would fill the niches you're used to seeing
animals fill. But the animals would be mostly reptiles. So things
wouldn't be so familiar after all.

### The Mesozoic Era {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1lc296b2ljIEVyYQ.._25-q7r}

The Paleozoic ended with a mass extinction. This left lots of habitats
available for new organisms. Adaptive radiation by reptiles filled these
habitats. The Mesozoic Era was the age of reptiles. The planet was
generally warmer than it is now. This climate was very good for
reptiles.

Reptiles developed adaptations for living away from water. Their thick
skin keeps them from drying out. The evolution of the amniote egg
allowed them to lay their eggs on dry land. The **amniote egg** has a
shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the
developing embryo ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1BbGxpZ2F0b3JFZ2c.) ).

#### Dinosaurs {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlub3NhdXJz_25-erp}

Earth in the Mesozoic was populated by an enormous diversity of
reptiles. Most of the reptiles were dinosaurs. Dinosaurs reigned the
planet for 160 million years. They had tremendous numbers and diversity.
Some were small and some were very large ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UUmV4QW5kR2FsbGlz) ). Some were
peaceful plant eaters. Some were extremely frightening meat eaters. Some
dinosaurs developed protection, such as horns, spikes, tail clubs, and
shielding plates. These adaptations were defense against active
predators.

Species of dinosaurs filled all the niches that are currently filled by
mammals. Most dinosaurs lived on land. Still, pterosaurs flew the skies.
Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTItMTctcGxlc2lvc2F1cnM.) ). Feathered
dinosaurs gave rise to birds.

Some examples of Mesozoic dinosaurs include this Tyrannosaurus Rex,

Scientists now think that some dinosaurs were endotherms (warm-blooded).
There is a lot of evidence for this hypothesis. Some dinosaurs lived in
very cold regions. Many dinosaurs grew fast and were very active.
Dinosaur bones had canals, like birds. Some dinosaurs stood upright and
had big brains. These features are more typical of endotherms.

An interesting look at the points for dinosaur endothermy is seen here:

#### Rise of the Mammals {#12.html#x-ck12-UmlzZSBvZiB0aGUgTWFtbWFscw.._25-ghj}

Mammals appeared near the end of the Triassic.

#### Cretaceous Extinction {#12.html#x-ck12-Q3JldGFjZW91cyBFeHRpbmN0aW9u_25-ghd}

The most famous mass extinction was 65 million years ago. Between the
Mesozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era, about 50% of all animal species died
off. This mass extinction is when the dinosaurs became extinct. Most
scientists think that the extinction was caused by a giant meteorite
that struck Earth. The impact heated the atmosphere until it became as
hot as a kitchen oven. Animals roasted. Dust flew into the atmosphere
and blocked sunlight for a year or more. This caused a deep freeze and
ended photosynthesis. Sulfur from the impact mixed with water in the
atmosphere. The result was acid rain. The rain dissolved the shells of
the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain. With
little food being produced, animals starved.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-v2q}

-   The amniote egg allowed reptiles to move away from water.
-   In the Mesozoic, dinosaurs filled the niches that mammals
    fill today.
-   About half of the life forms of the Mesozoic appear to have gone
    extinct due to a giant asteroid impact.

**Do these animals look familiar?**

The ice ages were very recent as Earth history goes. The animals are
familiar, but they're still very different from modern ones. For one
thing, most of them were huge. A small surface area-to-volume ratio is
better for keeping warm (less surface to lose heat from). Although the
dominant animals were mammals, the Pleistocene Earth still does not look
quite modern.

### The Cenozoic Era {#12.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbm96b2ljIEVyYQ.._26-6k7}

The Cenozoic Era is going on right now! It is the age of mammals. The
Cenozoic began with the extinction of every land creature larger than a
dog. This left many niches open. Organisms evolved to fill them.

There was a huge radiation of mammals. But birds, like the few seen in
the pictures ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QZWxpY2FuLUh1bW1pbmdiaXJkLUZhbGNvbg..)
), are more common and even more diverse. Both mammals and birds have
the ability to regulate their own body temperature. They are endotherms
(warm blooded). This was an advantage since Earth’s climate went through
sudden and dramatic changes.

#### Diversification of the Mammals {#12.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJzaWZpY2F0aW9uIG9mIHRoZSBNYW1tYWxz_26-ilo}

Mammals have adapted to all sorts of different environments. They were
able to spread to even more environments than the reptiles. Mammals are
endothermic and have fur, hair, or blubber for warmth. Mammals can walk,
swim, or fly. They can live in nearly all terrestrial environments.
Mammals initially filled the forests that covered many early Cenozoic
lands. When grasslands arose, mammals evolved to fill those niches too.
You can see pictures of many different mammals below ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1CYXQtV2hhbGVzLVNocmV3cy1FbGVwaGFudHM.)

#### Pleistocene Megafauna {#12.html#x-ck12-UGxlaXN0b2NlbmUgTWVnYWZhdW5h_26-za2}

As climate cooled during the ice ages, large mammals evolved. These are
called the Pleistocene megafauna. Mastodons, giant sloths, wooly
mammoths, giant condors, and saber tooth cats all evolved ( **Figure**

Many of the organisms that made up the Pleistocene megafauna went
extinct as conditions warmed. Some may have been driven to extinction by
human activities.

Other Cenozoic animals include hooved mammals, whales, primates, and
eventually humans.

**What is a "cave man"?**

What if you were to wake up with a group of Neanderthals? They were
close relatives to modern humans. Still you might find them to be a bit
different from your usual friends.

### Human Evolution {#12.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gRXZvbHV0aW9u_27-5vo}

Humans evolved during the later Cenozoic. New fossil discoveries
continue to alter the details of what we know about human evolution. The
major evolutionary events are well understood though.

#### Primate Ancestors {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJpbWF0ZSBBbmNlc3RvcnM._27-hxk}

Humans evolved from **primates** , a group of mammals that includes
lemurs, monkeys and apes. Humans are part of the apes, but we did not
evolve from **apes** , which also include chimpanzees and gorillas. Apes
and humans have a primate common ancestor. About 5 to 7 million years
ago, chimpanzees (our closest living relatives) and humans shared their
last common ancestor.

#### Hominids {#12.html#x-ck12-SG9taW5pZHM._27-c5y}

Animals of the genus, *Ardipithecus* lived roughly 4 to 6 million years
ago. These animals had brains roughly the size of a female chimp.
Although they lived in trees, they were bipedal. That is, they could
stand on two feet. What are the advantages to being bipedal? An organism
that can stand up can see farther. This is important if you live in a
grassland. A bipedal organism uses its hands and arms for hunting.

Another human ancestor, *Australopithecus afarensis* lived between 3.9
and 2.9 million years ago ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItNDQtQXVzdHJhbG9waXRoZWN1cw..) ).
These animals were completely bipedal. Their brains grew rapidly across
the generations.

**Figure 12.57**

*Australopithecus afarensis* is a human ancestor that lived about 3
million years ago.

</div>

#### *Homo* {#12.html#x-ck12-aGlpcWV4OGZubQ.._27-rnx}

The genus ***Homo*** , which has modern humans as its only living
species, appeared about 2.5 million years ago. These human-like primates
developed the first stone tools. *Homo erectus* evolved in Africa about
1.8 million years ago. Fossils of these animals show a much more
human-like body structure. This allowed them to travel long distances to
hunt. Cultures began and evolved.

#### *Homo sapiens* {#12.html#x-ck12-d3ltcTllanMxeg.._27-zp7}

*Homo sapiens* is our species. We originated about 200,000 years ago in
Africa. Evidence of a spiritual life appears about 32,000 years ago. The
evidence includes stone figurines that probably have religious
significance ( **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMTItNDUtZXZpZGVuY2Utc3Bpcml0dWFsLWxpZmU.)

The ice ages allowed humans to migrate. During the ice ages, water was
frozen in glaciers. Land bridges such as the Bering Strait allowed
humans to walk from the Old World to the New World.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-pqp}

-   *Australopithecus afarensis* was completely bipedal and had a
    growing brain.
-   *Homo erectus* evolved 1.8 million years ago. These organisms left
    behind signs of an early culture.
-   Our species is *Homo sapiens* . We evolved 200,000 years ago in
    Africa, and spread.

**Does this look more like geologic time?**

This image gives some sense of what life forms appeared when. Take a
good look. It's pretty amazing!

### Life and the Geologic Time Scale {#12.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBhbmQgdGhlIEdlb2xvZ2ljIFRpbWUgU2NhbGU._28-xfm}

The geologic time scale may include illustrations of how life on Earth
has changed. Major events on Earth may also be shown. These include the
formation of the major mountains or the extinction of the dinosaurs. The
figure above is a different kind of the geologic time scale. It shows
how Earth’s environment and life forms have changed.

#### Your Place in Geologic Time {#12.html#x-ck12-WW91ciBQbGFjZSBpbiBHZW9sb2dpYyBUaW1l_28-gt9}

We now live in the Phanerozoic Eon, the Cenozoic Era, the Quarternary
Period, and the Holocene Epoch. **Phanerozoic** means visible life.
During this eon, rocks contain visible fossils. Before the Phanerozoic,
life was microscopic. The Cenozoic Era means new life. It encompasses
the most recent forms of life on Earth. The Cenozoic is sometimes called
the Age of Mammals. Before the Cenozoic came the Mesozoic and Paleozoic.
The Mesozoic means middle life. This is the age of reptiles, when
dinosaurs ruled the planet. The Paleozoic is old life. Organisms like
invertebrates and fish were the most common lifeforms.

The Quaternary Period is the time since the beginning of the ice ages.
The climate has been cooler than it was earlier in the Cenozoic. Since
the end of the Pleistocene ice ages, which are probably not entirely
over, we have been in the Holocene Epoch. The Holocene is also called
the Recent.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._28-zym}

-   Complex life forms evolved relatively late in geologic time.
-   The Holocene is a teeny part of Earth history. Humans evolved
    very recently.
-   The last 540 million years has seen an incredible amount
    of biodiversity.

## Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-6tw}

Modern life is so diverse! Plants are found in the oceans and all over
the land. Plants can have a single cell. They can be giant trees.
Animals are also extremely diverse. They can also be very different in
size, from a single cell to the largest animal that ever lived—a blue
whale! Animals and plants live as part of ecosystems. Ecosystems are
different from each other but they have organisms playing nearly all the
same roles. There must be a source of food energy. For most life on
Earth food energy comes directly or indirectly from photosynthesis.
Feeding from plants are herbivores, and from herbivores are carnivores.
There are predators, scavengers, and decomposers, among others, to fill
out the ecosystem. Energy flows through the ecosystems. The connections
between organisms are made in a web. This is known as the food web.
There are many types of ecosystems in fresh water, the oceans, and on
land. Organisms must be well adapted to their habitats or they may go
extinct. Extinction of a species opens up a niche. A new and possibly
different species will evolve to fill that niche. This has occurred
throughout Earth's history. Mass extinctions have opened habitats. New
organisms have evolved to fill those habitats. The earliest life was
simple cells. Photosynthesis evolved and provided a food source for the
food web. Photosynthesis also supplied oxygen to the atmosphere.
Multicellular life didn't evolve for 4 billion years. During most of the
Paleozoic, life was restricted to the seas. Reptiles, especially
dinosaurs, ruled in the Mesozoic. Even in the Cenozoic life was fairly
different from what we see today. Humans and apes had a single ancestor.
The evolution of humans is better understood as more fossils are
discovered.

**What is the source of most energy?**

Almost all energy on Earth comes from the Sun. Plants make food energy
from sunlight. Fossil fuels are made of the remains of plants that
stored the Sun's energy millions of years ago. The Sun heats some areas
more than others. This causes wind. The Sun's energy also drives the
water cycle. In the water cycle, water moves over the Earth's surface.
Both wind power and water power can be used. Earth's internal heat does
not depend on the Sun for energy. This heat comes from remnant heat when
the planet formed. It also comes from the decay of radioactive elements.
Radioactivity is an important source of energy. Energy is just one
category of natural resources. Materials, like metals and rock, are also
natural resources. Plate tectonic processes are powered by Earth's
internal heat. These processes help to create some resources. Weathering
processes are driven by solar power. These processes help to create
other resources.

**How can a trip to an amusement park be a learning experience?**

Amusement parks use the laws of physics to generate fun! Gravity,
energy, centrifugal forces are all harnessed on various rides. Which is
your favorite?

### Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5-ndv}

**Energy** is the ability to move. Energy can also change matter from
one state to another (for example, from solid to liquid). Every living
thing needs energy to live and grow.

What makes energy available whenever you need it? If you unplug a lamp,
the light goes off. The lamp does not have a supply of energy to keep
itself lit. The lamp uses electricity that comes through the outlet as
its source of energy. The electricity comes from a power plant. The
power plant has a source of energy to produce this electricity.

#### Fuel {#13.html#x-ck12-RnVlbA..-lom}

The energy to make the electricity comes from fuel. Fuel stores the
energy and releases it when it is needed. **Fuel** is any material that
can release energy in a chemical change. The food you eat acts as a fuel
for your body. Gasoline and diesel fuel are fuels that provide the
energy for most cars, trucks, and buses. But there are many different
kinds of fuel.

For fuel to be useful, its energy must be released in a way that can be
controlled.

#### Heat {#13.html#x-ck12-SGVhdA..-hw2}

When fuel is burned, most of the energy is released as **heat** . Some
of this heat can be used to do work. Heat cooks food or warms your
house. Sometimes the heat is just waste heat. It still heats the
environment, though.

Heat from a wood fire can boil a pot of water. If you put an egg in the
pot, you can eat a hard boiled egg in 15 minutes (cool it down first!).
The energy to cook the egg was stored in the wood. The wood got that
energy from the Sun when it was part of a tree. The Sun generated the
energy by nuclear fusion. You started the fire with a match. The head of
the match stores energy as chemical energy. That energy lights the wood
on fire. The fire burns as long as there is energy in the wood. Once the
wood has burned up, there is no energy left in it. The fire goes out.

#### Using Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRW5lcmd5-ivf}

Your body gets its energy from food, but that is only a small part of
the energy you use every day. Cooking your food takes energy, and so
does keeping it cold in the refrigerator or the freezer. The same is
true for heating or cooling your home. Whether you are turning on a
light in the kitchen or riding in a car to school, you are using energy.
Billions of people all around the world use energy, so there is a huge
demand for resources to provide all of this energy. Why do we need so
much energy? The main reason is that almost everything that happens on
Earth involves energy.

#### The Sources of Earth's Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNvdXJjZXMgb2YgRWFydGgncyBFbmVyZ3k.-rxl}

Almost all energy comes from the Sun. Plants make food energy from
sunlight. Fossil fuels are made of the remains of plants and animals
that stored the Sun's energy millions of years ago.

The Sun heats some areas more than others, which causes wind. The Sun's
energy also drives the water cycle, which moves water over the surface
of Earth. Both wind and water power can be used as renewable resources.

Earth's internal heat does not depend on the Sun for energy. This heat
comes from remnant heat when the planet formed. It also comes from the
decay of radioactive elements. Radioactivity is an important source of
energy.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-j3w}

-   Energy is the ability to do work or change matter.
-   Energy from the Sun drives atmospheric processes on Earth, which
    leads to wind.

**What can an amusement park ride tell us about energy?**

This platform is about to change energy from potential to kinetic. The
energy is not lost; it just changes forms. The is on top of a precipice.
The rest of the ride runs on the potential energy the platform has when
it is at the top.

### Conservation of Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmF0aW9uIG9mIEVuZXJneQ.._1-ncb}

In this section, we're not talking about saving energy. This section is
about how energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can only change
forms. So we say that energy is conserved. Energy changes form when
something happens. But the total amount of energy always stays the same.
The Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or
destroyed. Scientists observed that energy could change from one form to
another. They also observed that the overall amount of energy did not
change.

#### Energy Changes {#13.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IENoYW5nZXM._1-yeb}

Here is an example of how energy changes form: kicking a soccer ball.
Your body gets energy from food. Where does the food get its energy? If
you're eating a plant, then the energy comes directly from the Sun. If
you're eating an animal, then the energy comes from a plant that got its
energy from the Sun.

Your body breaks down the food. It converts the food to **chemical
energy** and stores it. When you are about to kick the ball, the energy
must be changed again. **Potential energy** has the potential to do
work. When your leg is poised to kick the ball but is not yet moving,
your leg has potential energy. A ball at the top of a hill has the
potential energy of location.

**Kinetic energy** is the energy of anything in motion. Your muscles
move your leg, your foot kicks the ball, and the ball gains kinetic
energy ( **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDUtMDE.) ). The
kinetic energy was converted from potential energy that was in your leg
before the kick. The action of kicking the ball is energy changing
forms. The same is true for anything that involves change.

**Is your amusement park's energy source renewable?**

Nearly all amusement parks use non-renewable energy. However, a few are
now starting to use renewable energy. The Crealy Great Adventure Park in
Devon, England is going solar! Solar panels will be able to generate
enough energy to power most of the park in the summer. When there is
extra energy, it will supply the grid. Imagine what an amusement park
could do if it were located in a sunny place!

### Types of Energy Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgRW5lcmd5IFJlc291cmNlcw.._2-nch}

Energy resources can be put into two categories—renewable or
non-renewable. **Non-renewable resources** are used faster than they can
be replaced. **Renewable resources** can be replaced as quickly as they
are used. Renewable resources may also be so abundant that running out
is impossible.

The difference between non-renewable and renewable resources is like the
difference between ordinary batteries and rechargeable ones. If a
flashlight with ordinary batteries goes dead, the batteries need to be
replaced. But if the flashlight has rechargeable batteries, the
batteries can be placed in a charger. The charger transfers energy from
an outlet into the batteries. Once recharged, the batteries can be put
back into the flashlight. Rechargeable batteries can be used again and
again ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SZWNoYXJnZWFibGVCYXR0ZXJpZXM.) ). In
this way, the energy in the rechargeable batteries is renewable.

**Figure 13.3**

Rechargeable batteries are renewable because they can be refilled with
energy. Is the energy they are refilled with always renewable?

</div>

#### Types of Non-Renewable Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTm9uLVJlbmV3YWJsZSBSZXNvdXJjZXM._2-u3p}

**Fossil fuels** include coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are
the greatest energy source for modern society. Millions of years ago,
plants used energy from the Sun to form carbon compounds. These
compounds were later transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas. Fossil
fuels take millions of years to form. For this reason, they are
non-renewable. We will use most fossil fuels up in a matter of decades.
Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of pollution. The most
important of these may be the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.

#### Types of Renewable Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcw.._2-0tw}

Renewable energy resources include solar, water, wind, biomass, and
geothermal power. These resources are usually replaced at the same rate
that we use them. Scientists know that the Sun will continue to shine
for billions of years. So we can use the solar energy without it ever
running out. Water flows from high places to lower ones. Wind blows from
areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. We can use the flow of
wind and water to generate power. We can count on wind and water to
continue to flow! Burning wood ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-c2h1dHRlcnN0b2NrXzc5MTI2Mjkx) ), is an example
of biomass energy. Changing grains into biofuels is biomass energy.
Biomass is renewable because we can plant new trees or crops to replace
the ones we use. Geothermal energy uses water that was heated by hot
rocks. There are always more hot rocks available to heat more water.

**Figure 13.4**

Wood is a renewable resource, but forest ecosystems need time to
replenish.

</div>

Even renewable resources can be used unsustainably. We can cut down too
many trees without replanting. We might need grains for food rather than
biofuels. Some renewable resources are too expensive to be widely used.
As the technology improves and more people use renewable energy, the
prices will come down. The cost of renewable resources will go down
relative to fossil fuels as we use fossil fuels up. In the long run
renewable resources will need to make up a large amount of what we use.

#### Important Things to Consider About Energy Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW50IFRoaW5ncyB0byBDb25zaWRlciBBYm91dCBFbmVyZ3kgUmVzb3VyY2Vz_2-czy}

Before we put effort into increasing the use of an energy source, we
should consider two things. Is there a practical way to turn the
resource into useful form of energy? For example, it is not practical if
we don't get much more energy from burning a fuel than we put into
making it. For example, what if it took more energy to make solar panels
than we could get from the solar panels once they were working? Then
solar energy would not be worth pursuing until better solar panels were
developed.

What happens when we turn the resource into energy? What happens when we
use that resource? Mining the resource may cause a lot of health
problems or environmental damage. Using the resource may create a large
amount of pollution. In this case, that fuel may also not be the best
choice for an energy resource.

**Where is the energy coming from to power this bumper car?**

Bumper cars usually run on electricity. Much of the electricity we use
comes from fossil fuels. Coal or other fuels are burned in a power
plant. This powers a generator and creates electricity. So the car is
probably running on fossil fuels!

### Formation of Fossil Fuels {#13.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIEZvc3NpbCBGdWVscw.._3-d6k}

Fossil fuels are made from plants and animals that lived hundreds of
millions of years ago. The plants used energy from the Sun to form
energy-rich carbon compounds. As the plants and animals died, their
remains settled onto the ground and at the bottom of the sea. Layer upon
layer of organic material was laid down. Eventually, the layers were
buried very deeply. They experienced intense heat and pressure. Over
millions of years, the organic material turned into fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels are compounds of carbon and hydrogen, called
**hydrocarbons** ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDUtMDItNS1NZXRoYW5lLTNELW1vZGVs) ). An
animated view of a hydrocarbon is seen here:

**Figure 13.5**

Hydrocarbons are made of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This molecule with
one carbon and four hydrogen atoms is methane.

</div>

Hydrocarbons can be solid, liquid, or gas. The solid form is coal. The
liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil. The gaseous form is natural gas.

The solar energy stored in fossil fuels is a rich source of energy. But
because they take so long to form, they are nonrenewable.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-c50}

-   Hydrocarbons are molecules made of one carbon and four
    hydrogen atoms.
-   Ancient living organisms died and were buried quickly. Their remains
    were altered by intense heat and pressure. This formed fossil fuels.
-   Fossil fuels include solid coal, liquid petroleum, and liquid
    natural gas.

**Where does coal come from?**

Would you go to a coal mine? It's not very attractive. We like the
benefits of electricity, but coal must be mined. Coal mining can be done
by tunneling into a mountain. But if the coal is near the surface, the
whole mountaintop may be removed. That's what's been done in this photo.

### Coal {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29hbA.._4-abq}

**Coal** is a solid hydrocarbon. Coal is useful as a fuel, especially
for generating electricity. Coal is relatively inexpensive and abundant.
Developing nations, like China, rely heavily on coal. Around the world,
coal is the largest source of energy for electricity.

#### How Coal Forms {#13.html#x-ck12-SG93IENvYWwgRm9ybXM._4-ejt}

Coal forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of swamps
millions of years ago ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ucm9waWNhbFN3YW1w) ). Water and mud
in the swamp kept oxygen away from the plant material. Sand and clay
settled on top of the decaying plants. The weight of this material
squeezed out the water and some other substances. Over time, the organic
material became a carbon-rich rock. This rock is coal.

Coal has different grades. Bituminous coal forms at lower temperatures.
It contains a lot of sulfur. When it is burned, it causes a lot of
pollution. Anthracite coal forms under higher temperatures. This drives
off the sulfur, and the coal burns more cleanly.

#### What Coal Is {#13.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBDb2FsIElz_4-jlx}

Coal is a black or brownish-black rock that burns easily ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db2FsSGFuZHM.) ). Most coal is
sedimentary rock. The hardest type of coal, anthracite, is a metamorphic
rock. That is because it is exposed to higher temperature and pressure
as it forms. Coal is mostly carbon, but some other elements can be found
in coal, including sulfur. The coal with the least sulfur is the
cleanest coal. Anthracite has very little sulfur and so is very
desirable.

</div>

#### Using Coal {#13.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgQ29hbA.._4-tzz}

To prepare coal for use, the coal is first crushed into powder and
burned in a furnace. Like other fuels, coal releases most of its energy
as heat when it burns. The heat from the burning coal is used to boil
water. This makes steam. The steam spins turbines, which creates
electricity.

#### Coal in the USA {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29hbCBpbiB0aGUgVVNB_4-ub0}

The United States is rich in coal ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDUtMDItOC1VUy1jb2FsLXByb2R1Y2luZy1yZWdpb24.)
). Many regions of the country have significant coal deposits.

**What is this unusual sight?**

There's oil beneath this land. These drill rigs are pumping it to the
surface. Drill rigs can be small and closely spaced. They can be large
and solitary. This is true, especially when they are in deep water
offshore.

### Oil {#13.html#x-ck12-T2ls_5-gjd}

**Oil** is a thick, dark brown or black liquid. It is found in rock
layers of Earth's crust. Oil is currently the most commonly used source
of energy in the world.

#### How Oil Forms {#13.html#x-ck12-SG93IE9pbCBGb3Jtcw.._5-vbg}

The way oil forms is similar, in many ways, to coal. Tiny organisms like
plankton and algae die and settle to the bottom of the sea. Sediments
settle over the organic material. Oxygen is kept away by the sediments.
When the material is buried deep enough, it is exposed to high heat and
pressure. Over millions of years, the organic material transforms into
liquid oil.

#### Mining Oil {#13.html#x-ck12-TWluaW5nIE9pbA.._5-ncn}

The United States produces only about one-quarter as much oil as it
uses. The main oil producing regions in the U.S. are the Gulf of Mexico,
Texas, Alaska, and California.

Geologists look for oil in folded layers of rock called anticlines (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDUtMDItMTEtQW50aWNsaW5hbC1zdHJ1Y3R1cmFsLXRyYXA.)
). Oil moves through permeable rock and is trapped by the impermeable
cap rock.

**Figure 13.9**

Oil (red) is found in the porous rock layer (yellow) and trapped by the
impermeable layer (brown). The folded structure has allowed the oil to

</div>

#### Types of Oil {#13.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgT2ls_5-ume}

Oil comes out of the ground as **crude oil** . Crude oil is a mixture of
many different hydrocarbons. Oil is separated into different compounds
at an oil refinery. This is done by heating the oil. Each hydrocarbon
compound in crude oil boils at a different temperature. We get gasoline,
diesel, and heating oil, plus waxes, plastics, and fertilizers from
crude oil.

These fuels are rich sources of energy. Since they are mostly liquids
they can be easily transported. These fuels provide about 90% of the
energy used for transportation around the world.

#### Gasoline {#13.html#x-ck12-R2Fzb2xpbmU._5-pg7}

**Gasoline** is a concentrated resource. It contains a large amount of
energy for its weight. This is important because the more something
weighs, the more energy is needed to move it. If gasoline could only
provide a little energy, a car would have to carry a lot of it to be
able to travel very far. Or the car would need to be filled up
frequently. So a highly concentrated energy resource is a practical fuel
to power cars and other forms of transportation.

Let's consider how gasoline powers a car. As gasoline burns, it releases
most of its energy as heat. It also releases carbon dioxide gas and
water vapor. The heat makes the gases expand. This forces the pistons
inside the engine to move. The engine makes enough power to move the
car.

#### Using Oil {#13.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgT2ls_5-hts}

Using gasoline to power automobiles affects the environment. The exhaust
fumes from burning gasoline cause air pollution. These pollutants
include smog and ground-level ozone. Air pollution is a big problem for
cities where large numbers of people drive every day. Burning gasoline
also produces carbon dioxide. This is a greenhouse gas and is a cause of
global warming. Similar pollutants come from other forms of oil.

**Why would oil drillers burn off fuel?**

Natural gas is often found with petroleum. It is sometimes burned off by
companies that are only interested in the petroleum. Burning natural gas
off like this is wasting energy. These days, natural gas is becoming
more popular as a fuel.

### Natural Gas {#13.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBHYXM._6-p65}

**Natural gas** is mostly methane. Natural gas is usually found with
petroleum. People prefer to burn natural gas when possible because it is
relatively clean.

#### How Natural Gas Forms {#13.html#x-ck12-SG93IE5hdHVyYWwgR2FzIEZvcm1z_6-ne7}

Natural gas is often found along with coal or oil in underground
deposits. This is because natural gas forms with these other fossil
fuels. One difference between natural gas and oil is that natural gas
forms at higher temperatures.

#### Natural Gas Use {#13.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBHYXMgVXNl_6-pd7}

The largest natural gas reserves in the United States are located in the
Rocky Mountain states, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico region. California
also has natural gas, mostly in the northern Sacramento Valley and the
Sacramento Delta.

Natural gas must be processed before it can be used as a fuel. Poisonous
chemicals and water must be removed.

Natural gas is delivered to homes, where it is used for cooking and
heating. Natural gas is also a major energy source for powering turbines
to make electricity. Natural gas releases most of its energy as heat
when it burns. The power plant is able to use this heat, either in the
form of hot gases or steam, to spin turbines. The spinning turbines turn
generators, and the generators create electricity.

#### Extracting Natural Gas {#13.html#x-ck12-RXh0cmFjdGluZyBOYXR1cmFsIEdhcw.._6-un1}

Most natural gas comes from the wells that produce petroleum. An
increasing amount comes from a new method. Hydraulic fracturing, called
**fracking** , is very much in the news lately. Fracking makes it easier
and quicker to get natural gas from the rock ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1NYXJjZWxsdXMtU2hhbGU.) ).

**Figure 13.10**

Fracking delivers natural gas from rock that might not otherwise be
obtainable.

</div>

With fracking, fluids are pumped through a borehole. The fluids create
fractures in the rock that contains the natural gas. Chemicals in the
fluid prevent the fractures from closing. The natural gas can then be
pumped to the surface.

#### Consequences of Natural Gas Extraction and Use {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VxdWVuY2VzIG9mIE5hdHVyYWwgR2FzIEV4dHJhY3Rpb24gYW5kIFVzZQ.._6-p5r}

Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels. As a result, it
causes less air pollution. It also produces less carbon dioxide than the
other fossil fuels. Because it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels,
natural gas has a good reputation. Still, natural gas does emit
pollutants.

Fracking is being found to be destructive in several ways. Some of the
chemicals in the fracking fluids may be harmful. Some may cause cancer.
Some may be endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors interrupt the
natural hormones in the bodies of humans and animals. These fluids can
get into the groundwater. They may runoff into streams and other surface
waters. There they can cause problems.

The liquid waste injected into the deep wells may cause earthquakes.
Locations where seismic activity is unknown have begun to experience
earthquakes. Is fracking related to earthquake activity? Many geologists
think the link is undeniable.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-9c2}

-   Natural gas forms with crude oil but at higher temperatures.
-   Natural gas burns more cleanly than petroleum and produces fewer
    greenhouse gases.
-   Hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, is a relatively new method
    for extracting natural gas. Fracking may be linked to groundwater
    contamination and small earthquakes in non-seismic regions.

**Take a trip to Washington, D.C.?**

People are always protesting in our nation's capital. That's part of
liberty, part of democracy. The people in this photo are protesting
against the Keystone XL pipeline. Other people in other locations may be
protesting for the pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline would bring crude oil
from tar sands to the United States. People in favor say the oil from
tar sands will bring down energy costs and provide jobs. People opposed
say that the environmental consequences are not worth the benefits.

### Alternative Fossil Fuels {#13.html#x-ck12-QWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUgRm9zc2lsIEZ1ZWxz_7-mwq}

Easy-to-reach fossil fuel sources are being used up. Technologies are
being developed to get at harder-to-reach sources. Also, ways to tap
into alternative sources of fossil fuels are increasingly being
developed. These sources include oil shale and tar sands.

#### Oil Shale {#13.html#x-ck12-T2lsIFNoYWxl_7-uxr}

**Oil shale** is rock with oil dispersed through it. The oil has not
collected in reservoirs. Oil shale is mined in open pit mines. To
extract the oil from the rock, the rock is first crushed and heated to
very high temperatures. Water is washed over the rock, which converts
the fuel to petroleum. The petroleum can then be extracted from the
rock. You can see an example of an oil shale facility below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PaWxTaGFsZXM.) ).

Most of the world's oil shale is spread out in large areas of Wyoming,
Utah, and Colorado. In this region, water is scarce. Since the oil shale
is spread over a large area, mining would be environmentally
destructive.

</div>

#### Tar Sands {#13.html#x-ck12-VGFyIFNhbmRz_7-5od}

**Tar sands** are rocky materials mixed with very thick oil. The tar is
too thick to pump, and so tar sands are strip-mined. Hot water and
caustic soda are used to separate the oil from the rock. This creates a
slurry, which is shaken. The oil floats to the top and is skimmed off.

About 75% of the tar sands in the world are in Venezuela and Alberta,
Canada ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMDUtMDItMTktT2lsLXNhbmRzLW1pbmUtQ2FuYWRh)
). Large areas of land are degraded when tar sands are mined. A
tremendous amount of waste rock is produced from mining tar sands.

#### Consequences of Using Alternative Fossil Fuels {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VxdWVuY2VzIG9mIFVzaW5nIEFsdGVybmF0aXZlIEZvc3NpbCBGdWVscw.._7-lei}

Surface mining causes environmental damage. A lot of water may be
needed. The water may be degraded. For oil to be removed from shale, the
water must be heated. This requires energy. Tar sands and oil shale
fuels create more pollutants than other fossil fuels. Extracting usable
energy from oil shale and tar sands produces more greenhouse gases.

#### Keystone XL Pipeline {#13.html#x-ck12-S2V5c3RvbmUgWEwgUGlwZWxpbmU._7-2az}

The Keystone XL Pipeline would transport oil from the oil sands in
Alberta, Canada. The oil would travel into the United States. In the
U.S. it would be refined. The pipeline is controversial. A leak could
cause damage to wildlife habitat. A leak could also release enough oil
to contaminate the Ogallala Aquifer. The Aquifer is crucial to
agriculture and urban development in the Midwestern U.S. When burned,
the fuel from the oil sands would increase pollutants. Greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere would increase. The future of the pipeline is
currently on hold.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-zhc}

-   Easy to get at fossil fuels are running out, but there are other
    sources that are harder to get at that are still available.
-   Oil shales and tar sands are two of the alternative sources of
    fossil fuels that are much in the news.
-   The need for fossil fuels continues to grow as people in the
    developed world use more, and more people in the developing world
    want them.

**Where could long-term nuclear waste go?**

That's a very good question. For years, a waste facility was in
development in Nevada. The site at Yucca Mountain was canceled due to
public outcry. Now there is no facility for storing long-term nuclear
waste from most sources. No facilities are currently being developed
either.

### Nuclear Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVhciBFbmVyZ3k._8-dna}

**Nuclear energy** is produced by splitting the nucleus of an atom. This
releases a huge amount of energy.

#### How Nuclear Power Plants Work {#13.html#x-ck12-SG93IE51Y2xlYXIgUG93ZXIgUGxhbnRzIFdvcms._8-nza}

Nuclear power plants use uranium that has been concentrated in fuel rods
( **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OdWNsZWFyUGxhbnQ.) ).
The uranium atoms are split apart when they are hit by other extremely
tiny particles. These particles must be controlled or they would cause a
dangerous explosion.

**Figure 13.13**

Nuclear power plants like this one provide France with almost 80% of its
electricity.

</div>

Nuclear power plants use the energy they produce to heat water. The
water turns into steam, which causes a turbine to spin. This, in turn,
produces electricity.

#### Nuclear Power as a Resource {#13.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVhciBQb3dlciBhcyBhIFJlc291cmNl_8-1mh}

Many countries around the world use nuclear energy as a source of
electricity. For example, France gets about 80% of its electricity from
nuclear energy. In the United States, a little less than 20% of
electricity comes from nuclear energy.

Nuclear energy does not pollute. If there are no accidents, a nuclear
power plant releases nothing but steam into the air. But nuclear energy
does create other environmental problems. Splitting atoms creates
dangerous radioactive waste. These wastes can remain dangerous for
hundreds of thousands of years. Scientists and engineers are still
looking for ways to keep this waste safely away from people.

#### KQED: Nuclear Energy Use {#13.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogTnVjbGVhciBFbmVyZ3kgVXNl_8-4jk}

Nuclear power is a controversial subject in California and most other
places. Nuclear power has no pollutants including no carbon emissions.
However, power plants are not always safe. The long-term disposal of
wastes is a problem that has not yet been solved. The future of nuclear
power is murky. Find out more at:

Nuclear power is clean. It does not pollute the air. However, the use of
nuclear energy does create other environmental problems. Uranium must be
mined ( **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1VcmFuaXVtTWluZQ..)
). The process of splitting atoms creates radioactive waste. This waste
may be dangerous for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years. As
yet, there is no long-term solution for storing the radioactive waste.

Because nuclear energy is clean, nuclear power was making a comeback.
But the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in
Japan changed attitudes back. This accident seems to have resulted in a
new fear of nuclear power. The disaster was caused by a 9.0 magnitude
earthquake and tsunami. These events seriously damaged the plant.

Nuclear power is a controversial subject. Nuclear power has no
pollutants. Nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases. However,
accidents do happen, and they can be devastating. The long-term disposal

**Why don't we get our energy straight from the source?**

The Sun produces far more energy than humans can use. The Sun is also
the source of most of the energy we use. Fossil fuels and wind energy,
for example, originate with the Sun. So why don't we get all our energy
from the Sun? For one reason, it's not always practical.

Solar energy is clean and renewable. Solar panels are needed to collect
the sunlight for use.

</div>

Solar energy is clean and renewable. Earth receives many times more
solar energy than humans could ever imagine using.

#### Energy from the Sun {#13.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5IGZyb20gdGhlIFN1bg.._9-6h5}

The Sun is Earth’s main source of energy. The Sun gives us both light
and heat. The Sun changes hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion.
This releases huge amounts of energy. The energy travels to Earth mostly
as visible light. The energy is carried through the empty space by
**radiation** . We can use sunlight as an energy resource, called solar
energy.

#### Solar Energy as a Resource {#13.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgRW5lcmd5_9IGFzIGEgUmVzb3VyY2U.-s54}

Solar energy has been used on a small scale for hundreds of years. Today
we are using solar energy for more of our power demands. Solar power
plants are being built in many locations around the world. In the United
States, the southwestern deserts are well suited for solar plants.

#### Solar Power Plants {#13.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgUG93ZXIgUGxhbnRz_9-k9s}

Sunlight is turned into electricity at a solar power plant. A large
group of mirrors focuses sunlight on one place. This place is called a
receiver ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDUtMDgtc29sYXItdG93ZXI.) ). At the
receiver, a liquid such as oil or water is heated to a high temperature.
The liquid transfers its heat by **conduction** . In conduction, energy

transfers heat to the cooler object. At a solar power plant, the energy
conducted by the heated liquid is used to make electricity.

#### Solar Energy Use {#13.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgRW5lcmd5_9IFVzZQ..-m0l}

Solar energy is used to heat homes and water, and to make electricity.
Scientists and engineers have many ways to get energy from the Sun (
**Figure** [above](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Tb2xhclBWUGFuZWxz) ). One
is by using solar cells. Solar cells are devices that turn sunlight
directly into electricity. Lots of solar cells make up an individual
solar panel. You may have seen solar panels on roof tops. The Sun’s heat
can also be trapped in your home by using south facing windows and good
insulation.

#### Consequences of Solar Energy Use {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VxdWVuY2VzIG9mIFNvbGFyIEVuZXJneSBVc2U._9-xsg}

Solar energy has many benefits. It does not produce any pollution, and
there is plenty of it available—much more than we could possibly use.

But solar energy has problems. The Sun doesn't shine at night. A special
battery is needed to store extra energy during the day for use at night.
The technology for most uses of solar energy is still expensive. Until
solar technology becomes more affordable, most people will prefer to get
their energy from other sources.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-xhz}

-   Solar energy is the result of nuclear fusion in our nearest star.
-   A liquid is heated and moves that energy by conduction.
-   Solar power is expensive, but as demand increases, technology
    improves and costs decrease.

**What do dams do?**

If you take a trip out of Las Vegas toward Phoenix you can visit the
Hoover Dam. Completed in 1935, the dam provides power to over a million
homes. It also stores water for use by the residents of the desert
southwest. Hoover Dam is one of the engineering marvels of the 20th
century.

**Figure 13.18**

Water flowing through a dam.

</div>

Moving water has energy ( **Figure**
[above](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1EYW1XYXRlcg..) ). That energy is used
to make electricity. **Hydroelectric power** , or hydropower, harnesses
the energy of water moving down a stream. Hydropower is the most widely
used form of renewable energy in the world. This abundant energy source
provides almost one fifth of the world’s electricity. The energy of
waves and tides can also be used to produce water power. At this time,
wave and tidal power are rare.

#### Hydropower Plants {#13.html#x-ck12-SHlkcm9wb3dlciBQbGFudHM._10-vjb}

To harness water power, a stream must be dammed. Narrow valleys are the
best for dams. While sitting in the reservoir behind the dam, the water
has potential energy. Water is allowed to flow downhill into a large
turbine. While flowing downhill, the water has kinetic energy. Kinetic
energy makes the turbine spin. The turbine is connected to a generator,
which makes electricity.

#### Hydropower as a Resource {#13.html#x-ck12-SHlkcm9wb3dlciBhcyBhIFJlc291cmNl_10-fil}

Many of the suitable streams in the United States have been developed
for hydroelectric power. Many streams worldwide also have hydroelectric
plants. Hydropower is a major source of California’s electricity. It
accounts for about 14.5 percent of the total. Most of California’s
nearly 400 hydroelectric power plants are located in the Sierra Nevada
mountains.

#### Benefits and Problems of Hydropower {#13.html#x-ck12-QmVuZWZpdHMgYW5kIFByb2JsZW1zIG9mIEh5ZHJvcG93ZXI._10-ppz}

Water power does not burn a fuel. So it causes less pollution than many
other kinds of energy. Water power is also a renewable resource. Water
keeps flowing downhill. Although we use some of the energy from this
movement, we are not using up the water.

Water power does have problems. A large dam stops a stream's flow, which
floods the land upstream ( **Figure**
[above](#13.html#x-ck12-TGFrZV9tZWFk) ). A beautiful location may be
lost. People may be displaced. The dams and turbines also change the
downstream environment. Fish and other living things may not be able to
survive. Dams slow the release of silt. Downstream deltas retreat and
beaches may be starved of sand. Seaside cities may become exposed to
storms and rising sea levels.

Tidal power stations may need to close off a narrow bay or estuary. Wave
power plants must withstand coastal storms and the corrosion of
seawater.

#### KQED: Harnessing Power from the Sea {#13.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogSGFybmVzc2luZyBQb3dlciBmcm9tIHRoZSBTZWE._10-r9e}

Although not yet widely used, many believe tidal power has more
potential than wind or solar power for meeting alternative energy needs.

**Is this what a wind farm looks like?**

It's a strange sight. You're driving up the road in Southern California,
and sprouting from the ground is a pack of windmills! Windmills are
becoming more common on the eastern side of the mountains. This is
because the wind comes off the Pacific Ocean and funnels through
mountain passes. The wind is strong and California wants to take
advantage of it.

![Picture of windmills in Altamont
Pass](ck12_13_files/20150911030043826625.jpeg "Picture of windmills in Altamont Pass")

**Figure 13.20**

Winds are funneled through passes in mountain ranges. Altamont Pass in
California is the site of many wind turbines.

</div>

The energy from the Sun creates wind ( **Figure**
[above](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDUtMTAtd2luZC10dXJiaW5lcy1hbHRhbW9udA..)
). Wind energy moves by **convection** . The Sun heats some locations
more than others. Warm air rises, so other air rushes in to fill the
hole left by the rising air. This horizontal movement of air is called
wind.

#### Wind as a Resource {#13.html#x-ck12-V2luZCBhcyBhIFJlc291cmNl_11-oyp}

Wind power uses moving air as a source of energy. Some types of wind
power have been around for a long time. People have used windmills to
grind grain and pump water for hundreds of years. Sailing ships have
depended on wind for millennia. Wind is now used to generate
electricity. Moving air can make a **turbine** spin, just like moving
water can. Moving air has kinetic energy. When wind hits the blades of
the turbine, the kinetic energy makes the blades move. The turbine spins
and creates electricity.

#### Wind Power Advantages and Disadvantages {#13.html#x-ck12-V2luZCBQb3dlciBBZHZhbnRhZ2VzIGFuZCBEaXNhZHZhbnRhZ2Vz_11-lm3}

Wind power has many advantages. It is clean: it does not release
pollutants or carbon dioxide. It is plentiful almost everywhere. The
technology to harness wind energy is being developed rapidly.

Wind power also has problems. Wind does not blow all of the time, so
wind energy must be stored for later use. Alternatively, another energy
source needs to be available when the wind is not blowing. Wind turbines
are expensive. They can wear out quickly. Finally, windmills are not
welcomed by residents of some locations. They say that they are
unattractive. Yet even with these problems, wind turbines are a
competitive form of renewable energy.

Many states are currently using wind power. Wind turbines are set up in
mountain passes. This is common in California, where cool Pacific Ocean
air is sucked across the passes and into the warmer inland valleys.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-4oj}

-   Wind contains kinetic energy. The energy can move a turbine. This
    generates electricity.
-   Wind power is clean. It does not release pollutants or
    greenhouse gases.
-   Some people complain about the spread of windmills across certain
    locations, but, still, the use of wind energy is increasing.

**Why is there so much heat coming from below?**

A visit to an active geothermal area is likely to be very interesting.
Some of the most active ones in the U.S. are Yellowstone in Wyoming and
Lassen Peak in California. These places are not available for energy
production. But the Geysers Geothermal Resource Area in California is
used for energy. A magma chamber deep below produces dry superheated
steam. This steam can be harnessed.

### Geothermal Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-R2VvdGhlcm1hbCBFbmVyZ3k._12-pni}

**Geothermal energy** stems from Earth's internal heat. Hot springs and
geysers are produced by water that is heated by magma or hot rock below
the surface.

At a geothermal power plant, engineers drill wells into the hot rocks.
Hot water or steam may come up through the wells. Alternatively, water
may be put down into the well to be heated. It then comes up. The hot
water or steam makes a turbine spin. This makes electricity. Pictured
below is an example of a geothermal power plant ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HZW90aGVybWFsUGxhbnQ.) ).

#### Geothermal Energy as a Resource {#13.html#x-ck12-R2VvdGhlcm1hbCBFbmVyZ3kgYXMgYSBSZXNvdXJjZQ.._12-7ha}

Because the hot water or steam can be used directly to make a turbine
spin, geothermal energy can be used without processing. Geothermal
energy is clean and safe. It is renewable. There will always be hot
rocks, and water can be pumped down into a well. There, the water can be
heated again to make more steam.

Geothermal energy is an excellent resource in some parts of the world.
Iceland gets about one fourth of its electricity from geothermal
sources. In the United States, California leads all states in producing
geothermal energy. Geothermal energy in California is concentrated in
the northern part of the state. The largest plant is in the Geysers
Geothermal Resource Area. Geothermal energy is not economical
everywhere. Many parts of the world do not have underground sources of
heat that are close enough to the surface for building geothermal power
plants.

**Does this look like energy to you?**

Algae is sometimes mocked as a source of fuel. But algae are a
potentially wonderful source of power. They convert energy from the Sun
into food by photosynthesis. Algae can be grown in desert areas where
other crops cannot grow. Nutrients for algae may be wastes from other
processes. Algae can be processed to be made into a liquid. There is a
lot of research going on to harness algae for biofuels.

### Biomass {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvbWFzcw.._13-fkt}

Biomass is the material that comes from plants and animals that were
recently living. Biomass can be burned directly. This happens when you
burn a log in your fireplace. For as long as humans have had fire,
people have used biomass for heating and cooking.

To generate biomass energy, break down the cell walls of plants. This
releases the sugars. The sugars are then fermented to create fuel.

#### Biofuel {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvZnVlbA.._13-kdh}

More recently, people have learned to process biomass to make fuel. This
is called **biofuel** . Biofuel is created from crops, such as corn or
algae. Biofuel is unique among renewable energy sources. This is because
it is liquid. Unlike solar energy, for example, biofuels can be used in
a car ( **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1FODVQdW1w) ).
Biofuels burn more cleanly than fossil fuels. They create less pollution
and less carbon dioxide. Biofuels, such as ethanol, are added to
gasoline. This cuts down the amount of fossil fuels that are used.

#### Sources of Biomass Energy {#13.html#x-ck12-U291cmNlcyBvZiBCaW9tYXNzIEVuZXJneQ.._13-vyp}

Any organic material can be made into electricity. But some materials
are better than others. Wastes can be used, like almond shells. Biomass
power is a great use of wastes. It's hard to use wastes as a consistent
large scale source of energy though.

#### Consequences of Biomass Use {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VxdWVuY2VzIG9mIEJpb21hc3MgVXNl_13-tiv}

Some crops do not make good biofuels. Crops need energy, fertilizer, and
land to grow. Sometimes the amount of resources that go into producing
the crop is too high. The crop produces very little energy more than it
consumes. Corn is a very inefficient source of biofuels. Also, the
fertilizers and pesticides used to grow the crops enter the environment.
They run off the crops and become damaging pollutants in nearby water
bodies or in the oceans. Scientists are looking for much better sources
of biomass energy.

### Algae Biofuels {#13.html#x-ck12-QWxnYWUgQmlvZnVlbHM._13-jw9}

Research is being done into alternative crops for biofuels. A very
promising alternative is algae. Algae appears to be a better biofuel
than corn. Algae is much easier to convert to a usable fuel. Growing
algae requires much less land and energy than crops. Algae can be grown
in locations that are not used for other things. For example, they can
be grown in desert areas where food crops are not often grown. Corn must
be grown where food crops are grown. This can reduce the land and water
available for growing food. Algae can be fed agricultural and other
waste, so valuable resources are not used. Much research is being done
to bring these alternative fuels to market.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-czx}

-   Biofuels are useful because they are liquid. Biofuels can go into a
    gas tank unlike many other types of alternative energy.
-   Algae is the focus of much research. Algae is a very promising
    alternative to traditional crops for biofuels.

**What resources are in those electronics?**

When you pick up your personal electronics device or your mobile phone
do you ever think about what's in it? A tremendous variety of elements
are needed to make a single electronic device. Some are rare, some are
common. All must somehow come from Earth or its environment.

### Natural Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBSZXNvdXJjZXM._14-pky}

A **natural resource** is anything in nature that humans need. Metals
and fossil fuels are natural resources. But so are water, sunlight,
soil, and wind. Even living things are natural resources.

#### Using Natural Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgTmF0dXJhbCBSZXNvdXJjZXM._14-lg8}

We need natural resources for just about everything we do. We need them
for food and clothing, for building materials, and energy. We even need
them to have fun. Listed below are examples of how we use natural
resources ( **Table** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6VXNlTmF0UmVz) ).
Can you think of other ways we use natural resources?

**Click on the image above to view the table**

</div>

Some natural resources are renewable. Others are non-renewable. It
depends on what they are and how we use them.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-0is}

-   Many objects, such as a car, contain many types of resources.
-   Resources may be renewable or non-renewable, and an object may
    contain some of each.
-   Rare earth elements and other unusual materials are used in some
    electronic devices.

**What is the difference between these two stands of trees?**

Trees are renewable resources. Trees can be planted, grown up, and
harvested for timber. Forests are a different thing, however. A forest
is a mature ecosystem. It has trees of different sizes and ages, many
other plants, and lots of animals. A forest is a renewable resource but
it takes much more time to grow a forest than to grow a stand of trees.

### Renewable Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcw.._15-xar}

Renewable resources can be renewed as they are used. An example is
**timber** , which comes from trees. New trees can be planted to replace
those that are cut down. Sunlight is a renewable resource. It seems we
will never run out of that! What are some other renewable resources?

Just because a resource is renewable, it doesn’t mean we should use it
carelessly. If we aren’t careful, we can pollute resources. Then they
may no longer be fit for use. Water is one example. If we pollute a
water source, it may not be usable for drinking, bathing, or any other
type of use. We can also overuse resources that should be renewable. In
this case, the resources may not be able to recover. For example, fish
are renewable resources. That’s because they can reproduce and make more
fish. But water pollution and overfishing can cause them to die out if
their population becomes too low. Another example is pictured below (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMDEtZm9yZXN0cy1yZW5ld2FibGUtcmVzb3VyY2U.)
).

</div>

### Non-Renewable Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-Tm9uLVJlbmV3YWJsZSBSZXNvdXJjZXM._15-80o}

Some resources can’t be renewed. At least, they can’t be renewed fast
enough to keep up with use. Fossil fuels are an example. It takes
millions of years for them to form. We are using them up much more
quickly. Elements that are used to produce nuclear power are also
non-renewable resources. Uranium, for example, which is rare. Sooner or
later, it will run out.

Supplies of non-renewable resources are shrinking. This makes them
harder to get. Oil is a good example. Oil reserves beneath land are
running out. So oil companies have started to drill for oil far out in
the ocean. This costs more money. It’s also more dangerous. Pictured
below is an oil rig that exploded in 2010 ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMDItZGVlcC1zZWEtaG9yaXpvbi1leHBsb3Npb24.)
). The explosion killed 11 people. Millions of barrels of oil spilled
into the water. It took months to plug the leak.

**How would you find ores?**

There are many steps to finding an ore deposit. Find a place with likely
geology. Test the soil and rock for the ore mineral or others that are
often found with the ore mineral. Drill to test deeper rock and soil.
Then make a map and do the calculations. If the deposit is found to be
profitable, you can begin mining.

### Using Minerals {#13.html#x-ck12-VXNpbmcgTWluZXJhbHM._16-wvo}

When you use a roll of aluminum foil or some baby powder, you probably
don’t think about how the products were made. You may not even know that
those products are from minerals! We use minerals in many everyday
items. Minerals have to be located, removed from the ground, and refined
before they can be made into the products.

### Ore Deposits {#13.html#x-ck12-T3JlIERlcG9zaXRz_16-s9t}

A rock that contains important minerals is called an **ore** . The
concentration of valuable minerals in an ore may be high or low.

Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists
search for the places that might have ore deposits. For example, if you
want copper, you need to look at regions with a particular geology.
Copper is often found where hot fluids came off of a magma intrusion.
Aluminum is found in intensely weathered soils in tropical areas. Some
of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. Some may be at the
surface.

To find a mineral deposit, geologists study the geology of a lot of
places. They then go to a spot where that type of mineral deposit could
be found. They test the properties of the soil and rocks. They look at
the chemistry and the physical properties. They determine if a mineral
deposit is nearby.

After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is.
They may drill holes. They will test the chemistry of the rock from the
holes. Using this information, they will outline the deposit on a map.
This will allow them to determine the size and the concentration of ore
minerals. The geologists then calculate the total amount of valuable
minerals they think are in the deposit. The ore will only be mined if it
is profitable. Only if it is profitable, is a mineral deposit called an
**ore deposit** .

The bauxite pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMDMtMjMtYmF1eGl0ZQ..) ) is a rock that
contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.

</div>

If a mineral deposit is not profitable to mine it is not an ore deposit.
If conditions change, a deposit may become profitable that wasn't
before. Or an ore deposit may no longer be profitable to mine. What
could occur to make these changes? The price of the ore could rise or
fall. The price of extracting the ore could change. For example, if the
ore is hard to get at and the price of fuel goes up. This may make the
mineral deposit unprofitable to mine.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-afd}

-   An ore is a rock that contains important minerals.
-   An ore deposit must be profitable to mine. If it is no longer
    profitable, it is no longer an ore deposit.
-   Geologists find ore deposits by testing the chemistry of the rock
    and soil. They can also determine the size of the deposit.

**Can you be a miner too?**

Yes! You can go to certain rivers or streams to mine for gold placers.
You dip a large metal pan into the stream, and get some gravel and a
little water. You swish the mix around. The gold is the heaviest
material and it will sink to the bottom of the pan. You can then extract
it. The placers in the U.S with a lot of ore have already been mined
out. But you might make a little money!

### Mining Ores {#13.html#x-ck12-TWluaW5nIE9yZXM._17-j4p}

If an ore is found to be profitable, it will probably be mined. There
are two major types of mining: surface mining and underground mining.
There are different types of each of those two.

#### Surface Mining {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBNaW5pbmc._17-hrw}

Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earth’s
surface. Overlying rock is blasted, and the rock that contains the
valuable minerals is placed in a truck. The truck takes the rock to a
refinery. As pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PcGVuUGl0TWluZQ..) ), surface mining
includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. As the name suggests,
open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. The size
of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit.

Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and
dredging. Strip mining is like open pit mining but with material removed
along a strip. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks
and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.

**Figure 13.26**

Open pit mining is a form of surface mining, extracting ores close to
Earth's surface.

</div>

**Placers** are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. California’s
nickname, the Golden State, can be traced back to the discovery of
placer deposits of gold in 1848. The gold weathered out of hard
metamorphic rock in the western Sierra Nevada. The rock also contained
deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other valuable
minerals. The gold traveled down rivers and then settled in gravel
deposits. Currently, California has active mines for gold and silver.
Non-metal minerals such as sand and gravel, which are used for
construction, are also mined in California and elsewhere.

#### Underground Mining {#13.html#x-ck12-VW5kZXJncm91bmQgTWluaW5n_17-zeq}

Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earth’s
surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores.
An underground ore deposit can be approached from above, below, or
sideways. The direction depends on the placement of the ore body, its
depth, the concentration of ore, and the strength of the surrounding
rock. An example of an underground mine can be seen below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1VbmRlcmdyb3VuZE1pbmU.) ).

Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous. Fresh air and lights
must also be brought into the tunnels for the miners. Accidents are far
too common.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-xpn}

-   Surface mines are created for mineral deposits that are near
    the surface.
-   Underground mines are blasted into rock to get at deeper deposits.
-   Underground mining is difficult; the safety and health of the miners
    is hard to maintain.

**How can you save energy and materials?**

Getting ore from rock takes a lot of energy. Getting ore from
preexisting materials uses a lot less. It turns out that if you recycle
just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy in one gallon of
gasoline. You will save aluminum too!

### Ore Extraction {#13.html#x-ck12-T3JlIEV4dHJhY3Rpb24._18-c73}

When the ore leaves the mine, it is not yet a useful material (
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PcmVUcnVjaw..) ). Most
ores are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks are full
of valuable minerals. They also contain rock that isn't valuable, which
is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the
waste rock.

**Figure 13.28**

</div>

To separate the ore from the waste rock, first the rocks are crushed.
Then the minerals are separated out of the ore. There are a few methods
for doing this:

-   **Heap Leaching** : the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or
    acid, to remove ore. This is often done at very high temperatures.
-   **Flotation** : the addition of a compound that attaches to the
    valuable mineral and floats.
-   **Smelting** : roasting rock at a temperature greater than 900
    ^o^ C. This causes it to segregate into layers. The valuable
    minerals are then extracted. This requires a lot of energy.

Extracting metal from rock is so energy-intensive that it's much better
to recycle. We use over 80 billion aluminum cans each year. If all of
these cans were recycled, we would save the energy in 2 billion gallons
of gasoline!

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-h3h}

-   To extract ore from rock, the rock is first crushed.
-   Ore is extracted from rock by heap leaching, flotation, or smelting.
-   Extracting ore from rock can take a lot of energy.

**Can you tell that this was a mine?**

Mining can do a lot of damage to a region. Mining companies are now
supposed to return the land to its natural state when they are done.
Sometimes this works really well. It's hard to tell there was a mine
here!

### Mining and the Environment {#13.html#x-ck12-TWluaW5nIGFuZCB0aGUgRW52aXJvbm1lbnQ._19-2xt}

Mining provides people with many resources they need. But mining can be
hazardous to the environment. For surface mines, miners clear the land
of soil and plants. Nearby lakes and streams may be inundated with
sediment. The mined rock may include heavy metals. These also enter the
sediment and water. Removing metals from rock may involve toxic
chemicals. Acid flow from a mine site will change the chemistry of a
nearby stream or lake.

#### Land Reclamation {#13.html#x-ck12-TGFuZCBSZWNsYW1hdGlvbg.._19-9x2}

U.S. law states that once mining is complete, the land must be restored
to its natural state. This process is called **reclamation** . A pit may
be refilled with dirt. It may be filled with water to create a lake. The
pits may be turned into landfills. Underground mines may be sealed off
or left open as homes for bats. The land is reshaped. Native plants are
planted.

#### Mine Pollution {#13.html#x-ck12-TWluZSBQb2xsdXRpb24._19-yqh}

Mining can cause pollution. Chemicals released from mining can
contaminate nearby water sources. Pictured below is water that is
contaminated from a nearby mine ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1NaW5lQ29udGFtaW5hdGlvbg..) ). The
United States government has mining standards to protect water quality.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-xko}

-   Surface mining clears the land. Rock, dirt, and plants are
    all disturbed.
-   Mining releases pollutants from rock or as metals are removed
    from rock.
-   Reclamation occurs when people attempt to return the mined land to
    its original state.

**When do a few illnesses indicate a larger problem?**

At Love Canal, New York, many children became sick. Many pregnancies
never went to term. More than half of the babies born had a birth
defect. Residents started to notice that things were not normal. When
they investigated, they found out that their homes and school were built
on a toxic waste dump. They called attention to the problem and asked
for help.

### The Story of Love Canal {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN0b3J5IG9mIExvdmUgQ2FuYWw._20-9io}

Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls. It is the site of one of
the worst environmental disasters of all time. Love Canal gained
worldwide attention in the late 1970s when the press started covering
its story. The story is outlined and illustrated below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMDgtTG92ZS1DYW5hbA..) ).

### Pollution by Hazardous Waste {#13.html#x-ck12-UG9sbHV0aW9uIGJ5IEhhemFyZG91cyBXYXN0ZQ.._20-qlt}

Love Canal highlighted the problem of pollution by hazardous waste.
**Hazardous waste** is any waste that is dangerous to the health of
people or the environment. It may be dangerous because it is toxic,
corrosive, flammable, or explosive. Hazardous waste can contaminate the
land, soil and water.

-   Toxic waste is poisonous. Toxic waste may cause cancer or birth
    defects in people. It may also harm other living things.
-   Corrosive waste is highly reactive with other substances. Corrosive
    waste may cause burns or destroy other materials that it touches.
-   Flammable waste can burn easily. It may also give off harmful fumes
    when it burns.
-   Explosive waste is likely to explode. The risk of explosion may be
    greater if the waste is mixed with other substances.

### Hazardous Waste Around Your Home {#13.html#x-ck12-SGF6YXJkb3VzIFdhc3RlIEFyb3VuZCBZb3VyIEhvbWU._20-8ef}

**What should be done about hazardous waste sites?**

Laws now protect lands from contamination. Many sites were damaged
before those laws were passed. Cleaning up toxic wastes costs a lot of
time and money. Sometimes the company that caused the damage no longer
exists. Sometimes they cannot afford cleanup. Then it becomes the
government's job to clean up the site. No other organization is big
enough to be sure a cleanup happens.

### The Superfund Act {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN1cGVyZnVuZCBBY3Q._21-h9y}

Love Canal opened people’s eyes to toxic waste burial. They realized
there must be other “Love Canals” all over the country. Thousands of
contaminated sites were found. The **Superfund Act** was passed in 1980.
The law required that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste
sites. The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in the
future.

Love Canal became a **Superfund site** in 1983. As a result, several
measures were taken to secure the toxic wastes. The land was capped so
that water could not reach the waste. Toxic material was cleaned from
the nearby area. Contaminated soils were removed.

### Controlling Hazardous Waste {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbGxpbmcgSGF6YXJkb3VzIFdhc3Rl_21-h0n}

The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry. Agriculture is
another major source. Even households produce a lot of hazardous waste.

#### Hazardous Waste from Industry and Agriculture {#13.html#x-ck12-SGF6YXJkb3VzIFdhc3RlIGZyb20gSW5kdXN0cnkgYW5kIEFncmljdWx0dXJl_21-3n1}

Thanks to the lessons of Love Canal, the U.S. now has laws requiring the
safe disposal of hazardous waste. Companies must ensure that hazardous
waste is not allowed to enter the environment in dangerous amounts. They
must also protect their workers from hazardous materials. For example,
they must provide employees with the proper safety gear and training (
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMTAtSGF6YXJkLXdhc3RlLWRpc3Bvc2Fs) ).

#### Household Hazardous Waste {#13.html#x-ck12-SG91c2Vob2xkIEhhemFyZG91cyBXYXN0ZQ.._21-a4b}

Cleaning products, lawn chemicals, paints, batteries, motor oil—these
are just some of the many hazardous materials that may be found in
households. You might think that a household doesn’t produce enough
hazardous waste to worry about. But all the waste from all the
households adds up. A city of just 50,000 people might produce more than
40 tons of hazardous waste each year! Clearly, how households deal with
hazardous waste matters.

What can your family do? Reduce, reuse, recycle, or properly dispose of
the wastes.

1.  Reduce the amount of hazardous products you buy. For example, if you
    only need a quart of paint for a job, don’t buy a gallon.
2.  Use less hazardous products if you can. For example, clean windows
    with vinegar and water instead of toxic window cleaners.
3.  Reuse products if it’s safe to do so. For example, paint thinner
    that has been used to clean paint brushes can be strained
    and reused.
4.  Recycle whenever possible. For example, some service stations allow
    you to drop off used motor oil, car batteries, or tires
    for recycling.
5.  Always properly dispose of hazardous waste. For example, let liquid
    waste evaporate before placing the container in the trash.

Proper disposal depends on the waste. Many hazardous products have
disposal guidelines on the label. That’s one reason why you should keep
the products in their original containers. The labels also explain how
to use the products safely. Follow the instructions to protect yourself
and the environment. Most communities have centers for disposing of
household hazardous waste ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMTktMTEtRGlzcG9zYWw.) ). Do you know how
to dispose of hazardous waste in your community?

**Who uses more resources?**

It's not hard to tell that the people on the right use more resources
than those in the home on the left. Many natural resources were needed
to create a home like this. Imagine a world in which everybody had equal
access to resources. Some people would have fewer resources than they do
now. But many people would have more.

### Resource Availability {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVzb3VyY2UgQXZhaWxhYmlsaXR5_22-r4h}

Whether a resource is available for use depends on several factors.

-   Supply: Some resources are very abundant. Some are rare. When a
    resource is close to running out, a replacement needs to be found.
    Some resources are very valuable because they are very rare.
-   Price: The price of a resource depends on how much of it
    is available. It also depends on how easy it is to find and extract.
    A resource may not be used until its price goes up enough to cover
    the costs of finding and extracting it.
-   Politics: Resources are not found equally around the world. Some
    nations may have a lot of certain vital resources. Some nations may
    have none. It is possible for a nation rich in a resource to control
    who gets it. They can also control the price.

### Who Uses Natural Resources? {#13.html#x-ck12-V2hvIFVzZXMgTmF0dXJhbCBSZXNvdXJjZXM__22-6do}

Rich nations use more natural resources than poor nations. In fact, the
richest 20 percent of people use 85 percent of the world’s resources.
What about the poorest 20 percent of people? They use only 1 percent of
the world's resources ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMDMtcmVzb3VyY2UtZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9u) ).

**Figure 13.33**

The U.S. uses more than its share of oil. What if everyone used
resources this way? We would need five times more space to produce what
was used! (Note: Per capita means “per person.”)

</div>

#### More People, More Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-TW9yZSBQZW9wbGUsIE1vcmUgUmVzb3VyY2Vz_22-c0p}

Every 20 minutes, the human population adds 3,500 more people. More
people need more resources. For example, we now use five times more
fossil fuels than we did in 1970. The human population is expected to
increase for at least 40 years. What will happen to resource use?

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-nxw}

-   The availability of a resource depends on how much of it there is,
    how much it costs to get, and where it is located.
-   Politics plays an important role in resource availability.
-   The world's wealthiest people use most of the resources. The world's
    poorest people use very few resources.

**Can you make a difference?**

Yes! You can conserve natural resources every day with every decision
you make. Should you recycle that can? Yes! Should you buy a bottle of
water or drink from the water fountain? Fountain! Should you walk or
ride your bike to school or ask for a ride? Walk or ride your bike—it's
good exercise too!

### Conserving Natural Resources {#13.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmluZyBOYXR1cmFsIFJlc291cmNlcw.._23-hov}

How can we protect Earth’s natural resources? One answer is
**conservation** . This means saving resources. We need to save
resources so some will be left for the future. We also need to protect
resources from pollution and overuse.

When we conserve resources, we also cut down on the trash we produce.
Americans throw out 340 million tons of trash each year. We throw out
2.5 million plastic bottles alone—every hour! Most of what we throw out
ends up in landfills ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1MYW5kZmlsbFRydWNr) ). In a landfill,
all those plastic bottles take hundreds of years to break down. What are
the problems caused by producing so much trash? Natural resources must
be used to produce the materials. Land must be given over to dump the
materials. If the materials are toxic, they may cause pollution.

### The Three “R”s {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRocmVlIOKAnFLigJ1z_23-qee}

You probably already know about the three “R”s. They stand for reduce,
reuse, and recycle. The third “R”—recycle—has caught on in a big way.
That’s because it’s easy. There are thousands of places to drop off
items such as aluminum cans for recycling. Many cities allow you to just
put your **recycling** in a special can and put it at the curb.

We haven’t done as well with the first two “R”s—reducing and reusing.
But they aren’t always as easy as recycling. Recycling is better than
making things from brand new materials. But it still takes some
resources to turn recycled items into new ones. It takes no resources at
all to reuse items or not buy them in the first place.

#### Reduce {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVkdWNl_23-v7h}

Reducing resource use means just what it says—using fewer resources.
There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources.

-   Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will
    last longer. You’ll buy fewer items in the long run, so you’ll save
    money as well as resources. That's a win-win!
-   Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a
    new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. You’ll use
    fewer resources and save money.
-   Buy only what you need. Don’t buy a gallon of milk if you can only
    drink half of it before it spoils. Instead, buy a half gallon and
    drink all of it. You won’t be wasting resources (or money!).
-   Buy local. For example, buy local produce at a farmer’s market, like
    the one pictured below ( **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1GYXJtZXJzTWFya2V0) ). A lot of
    resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances. Products
    bought at farmer's markets use less packaging, too!

**Figure 13.35**

Buying locally grown produce at a farmer's market saves resources.

</div>

About a third of what we throw out is packaging. Try to buy items with
the least amount of packaging. For example, buy bulk items instead of
those that are individually wrapped. Also, try to select items with
packaging that can be reused or recycled. This is called **precycling**
. Pop cans and plastic water bottles, for example, are fairly easy to
recycle. Some types of packaging are harder to recycle ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMDYtaGFyZC10by1yZWN5Y2xlLXBhY2thZ2luZw..)
). If it can’t be reused or recycled, it’s a waste of resources.

-   Many plastics: The recycling symbol on the bottom of plastic
    containers shows the type of plastic they contain. Numbers 1 and 2
    are easier to recycle than higher numbers.
-   Mixed materials: Packaging that contains more than one material may
    be hard to recycle. This carton is made mostly of cardboard. But it
    has plastic around the opening.

These types of packaging are hard to recycle. Could you reuse any of
them?

</div>

#### Reuse {#13.html#x-ck12-UmV1c2U._23-f2t}

Reusing resources means using items again instead of throwing them away.
A reused item can be used in the same way by someone else. Or it can be
used in a new way. For example, Shana has a pair of jeans she has
outgrown. She might give them to her younger sister to wear. Or she
might use them to make something different for herself, say, a denim
shoulder bag. Some other ideas for reusing resources are pictured below
( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjAtMDctcmV1c2luZy1yZXNvdXJjZXM.) ).

resources?

#### Recycle {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVjeWNsZQ.._23-cxd}

Many things can be recycled. The materials in them can be reused in new
products. For example, plastic water bottles can be recycled. The
recycled material can be made into t-shirts! Old phone books can also be
recycled and made into textbooks. When you shop for new products, look
for those that are made of recycled materials ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SZWN5Y2xlZE1hdGVyaWFs) ). Even food
scraps and lawn waste can be recycled. They can be composted and turned
into humus for the garden.

At most recycling centers, you can drop off metal cans, cardboard and
paper products, glass containers, and plastic bottles. Recycling
stations, like the one pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1SZWN5Y2xlQmlucw..) ), are common.
Curbside recycling usually takes these items too. Do you know how to
recycle in your community? Contact your local solid waste authority to
find out. If you don’t already recycle, start today. It's a big way you
can help the planet!

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._23-j84}

-   Conservation is a very effective way to help us to have useful
    materials in the future.
-   To conserve, follow the three R's: reduce, reuse, recycle.
-   Reduce means to just use less.
-   Reuse means to use something again, pass it on to someone who will,
    or change it so that it can be used in another way.
-   Recycle means to have it recycled in your community. This is great;
    although, it does take energy.

## Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-6fa}

Natural resources include energy, minerals and other materials. Natural
resources may be renewable or non-renewable. Non-renewable resources
cannot be replaced. When they're gone, they're gone. Renewable resources
can be replaced. They can supply human activities forever. Fossil fuels
are crucial for modern human society. Fossil fuels are essential for
transportation, industry and agriculture. Renewable energy resources
tend to be clean. They emit fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases than
fossil fuels. Renewable resources often have other problems. They are
more costly and less efficient than fossil fuels. Still, they have many
advantages. Research is going into developing renewable resources.
Conservation is the best way to increase resource availability. Anyone
can conserve! You and your family can. Society can. The world can. Just
reduce, reuse, recycle.

**How well do humans know the solar system?**

Humans have been exploring the solar system for centuries. Mostly we
have used telescopes or simply our eyes. But the Sun, all of the
planets, and many dwarf planets, asteroids and comets have been studied
more closely. Spaceships have taken rovers, probes or other technologies
to study these bodies. Sometimes a spacecraft just flies by to take a
look. So while it's very difficult to get humans very far from Earth,
our spacecraft have become our eyes. We know an incredible amount about
the solar system compared with even a few decades ago. This is because
of the tremendous spacecraft and the instruments they carry. In this
concept, we will explore a small fraction of what scientists have
learned about our solar system.

**How can we learn about something as hot as the Sun?**

Humans have sent spacecraft up to study our star. The SOHO spacecraft
has been in operation since 1996. The craft orbits the Sun in step with
Earth but closer to it. SOHO has sent back amazing images. Onboard
instruments have also sent back mountains of data. The data is mostly
about the Sun's outer layers.

### The Sun {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN1bg..-os2}

Our Sun is a **star** , a sphere of plasma held together by gravity. It
is an ordinary star that is extraordinarily important. The Sun provides
light and heat to our planet. This star supports almost all life on
Earth.

The Sun is the center of the **solar system** , which includes all of
the planets and other bodies that orbit it. It is by far the largest
part of the solar system ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMTctU3VuU2l6ZQ..) ). Added together,
all of the planets make up just 0.2 percent of the solar system's mass.
The Sun makes up the remaining 99.8 percent of all the mass in the solar
system!

**What does the Sun look like?**

Different instruments pick up different features of the Sun. None can
show us the Sun's interior. But studies from the SOHO spacecraft and
other craft allow us to study the interior. We know a surprising amount
about a body that is so hot and so far away.

### Layers of the Sun {#14.html#x-ck12-TGF5ZXJzIG9mIHRoZSBTdW4._1-cor}

The Sun is made almost entirely of the elements hydrogen and helium. The
Sun has no solid material. Most atoms in the Sun exist as **plasma** .
Plasma is superheated gas with an electrical charge. Because the Sun is
made of gases, it does not have a defined outer boundary. Like Earth,
the Sun has an internal structure. The inner three layers make up what
we would actually call “the Sun.”

#### Internal Structure {#14.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJuYWwgU3RydWN0dXJl_1-tnu}

Because the Sun is not solid, it does not have a defined outer boundary.
It does, however, have a definite internal structure with identifiable
layers ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdW5JbnRlcm5hbFN0cnVjdHVyZQ..) ).
Since the layers are not solid, the boundaries are fuzzy and indistinct.
From inward to outward, the layers are: the core, the radiative zone,
and the convection zone.

**Figure 14.2**

The layers of the Sun.

</div>

#### The Core {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENvcmU._1-sev}

The **core** is the Sun's innermost layer. The core is plasma. It has a
temperature of around 15 million degrees Celsius (°C). Nuclear fusion
reactions create the immense temperature. In these reactions, hydrogen
atoms fuse to form helium. This releases vast amounts of energy. The
energy moves toward the outer layers of the Sun. Energy from the Sun's
core powers most of the solar system.

#### Radiative Zone {#14.html#x-ck12-UmFkaWF0aXZlIFpvbmU._1-wzw}

The **radiative zone** is the next layer out. It has a temperature of
about 4 million °C. Energy from the core travels through the radiative
zone. The energy travels at an extremely slow rate. Light particles are
called **photons** . In the radiative zone, photons can only travel a
few millimeters before they hit another particle. The particles are
absorbed and then released again. It may take 50 million years for a
photon to travel all the way through the radiative zone.

#### The Convection Zone {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENvbnZlY3Rpb24gWm9uZQ.._1-a3u}

The **convection zone** surrounds the radiative zone. In the convection
zone, hot material from near the Sun’s center rises. This material cools
at the surface and then plunges back downward. The material then
receives more heat from the radiative zone. The first video describes
the basics of our Sun, including how it is powered by nuclear reactions:

**What can you see during a solar eclipse?**

A solar eclipse is kind of like a field trip to the Sun from Earth. You
can see something (with special tinted glasses) that you don't usually
see. The Sun has a remarkable ring of light around it. This is the
corona. If you have a chance to see a solar eclipse, you should do it.

### The Outer Layers {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE91dGVyIExheWVycw.._2-wpu}

The three outer layers of the Sun are its atmosphere. The layers are,
from inside to outside, the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the
corona.

#### The Photosphere {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBob3Rvc3BoZXJl_2-jow}

The **photosphere** is the visible surface of the Sun ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMTgtU3VuLWF0bW9zcGhlcmU.) ). It's
the part that we see shining. Surprisingly, the photosphere is also one
of the coolest layers of the Sun. It is only about 6,000°C.

The Sun's atmosphere contains the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the
corona. This image was taken by NASA's Spacelab 2 instruments.

</div>

#### The Chromosphere {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENocm9tb3NwaGVyZQ.._2-pfm}

The **chromosphere** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1EZXRhaWxlZENocm9tb3NwaGVyZQ..) ) lies
above the photosphere. It is about 2,000 km thick. The thin chromosphere
is heated by energy from the photosphere. Temperatures range from about
4,000°C to about 10,000°C. The chromosphere is not as hot as other parts
of the Sun, and it glows red. Jets of gas sometimes fly up through the
chromosphere. With speeds up to 72,000 km per hour, the jets can fly as
high as 10,000 km.

#### The Corona {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENvcm9uYQ.._2-pea}

The **corona** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db3JvbmE.) ) is the outermost part of
the Sun's atmosphere. It is the Sun’s halo, or “crown.” With a
temperature of 1 to 3 million K, the corona is much hotter than the
photosphere. The corona extends millions of kilometers into space.
Sometime you should try to see a total solar eclipse. If you do, you
will see the Sun’s corona shining out into space.

**Is the Sun always the same?**

For most of human history, people thought the Sun didn't change much.
But technology has offered us a window into the Sun's life. SOHO and
other technologies allow us to observe incredible sunspots, flares, and
prominences. Some of these are featured in this concept.

### Surface Features of the Sun {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBGZWF0dXJlcyBvZiB0aGUgU3Vu_3-kfj}

The Sun has many incredible surface features. Don't try to look at them,
though! Looking directly at the Sun can cause blindness. Find the
appropriate filters for a pair of binoculars or a telescope and enjoy!

#### Sunspots {#14.html#x-ck12-U3Vuc3BvdHM._3-u5m}

The most noticeable magnetic activity of the Sun is the appearance of
sunspots. **Sunspots** are cooler, darker areas on the Sun’s surface (
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TdW5zcG90czI.) ). Sunspots
occur in an 11-year cycle. The number of sunspots begins at a minimum.
The number gradually increases to the maximum. Then the number returns
to a minimum again.

Sunspots form because loops of the Sun’s magnetic field break through
the surface. Sunspots usually occur in pairs. The loop breaks through
the surface where it comes out of the Sun. It breaks through again where
it goes back into the Sun. Sunspots disrupt the transfer of heat from
the Sun's lower layers.

**Figure 14.6**

The darker regions in this image are sunspots.

</div>

#### Solar Flares {#14.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgRmxhcmVz_3-t4l}

A loop of the Sun’s magnetic field may break. This creates **solar
flares** . Solar flares are violent explosions that release huge amounts
of energy ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1WYWxlbnRpbmVzRGF5U29sYXJGbGFyZQ..) ).
The streams of high energy particles they emit make up the **solar
wind** . Solar wind is dangerous to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar
flares can even cause damage on Earth. They have knocked out entire
power grids and can disturb radio, satellite, and cell phone
communications.

</div>

#### Solar Prominences {#14.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgUHJvbWluZW5jZXM._3-oqg}

Another amazing feature on the Sun is **solar prominences** . Plasma
flows along the loop that connects sunspots. This plasma forms a glowing
arch. The arch is a solar prominence. Solar prominences can reach
thousands of kilometers into the Sun’s atmosphere. Prominences can last
for a day to several months. Prominences can be seen during a total
solar eclipse.

#### Solar Dynamics Observatory {#14.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgRHluYW1pY3MgT2JzZXJ2YXRvcnk._3-bi1}

NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on February 11,
2010. SDO is studying the Sun’s magnetic field. This includes how the
Sun affects Earth's atmosphere and climate. SDO provides extremely high
resolution images. The craft gathers data faster than anything that ever
studied the Sun.

.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-01o}

-   Sunspots occur in pairs. Each is one side of a loop of the Sun's
    magnetic field on the Sun's surface. Sunspots come and go on an
    11-year cycle.
-   Sunspots are cooler and darker than the rest of the Sun's surface.
    They are marked by intense magnetic activity.
-   Solar prominences are the plasma loops that connect two sunspots.
-   Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are eruptions of highly
    energetic particles from the Sun's surface.

**Can humans take a field trip through the solar system?**

A field trip through the solar system would take a long time. It took 12
years for the Voyager spacecraft to get from Earth to Neptune. If a
human was on board, he or she would probably want to come back!
Fortunately, unmanned spacecrafts can send back images of far distant
places in the solar system.

### Solar System Objects {#14.html#x-ck12-U29sYXIgU3lzdGVtIE9iamVjdHM._4-rid}

Astronomers now recognize eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), five dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto,
Makemake, Haumea, and Eris), more than 150 moons, and many, many
asteroids and other small objects ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjUtMDctUGxhbmV0cw..) ). These objects
move in regular and predictable paths around the Sun.

#### Planet Sizes {#14.html#x-ck12-UGxhbmV0IFNpemVz_4-ckt}

The Sun is just an average star compared to other stars. But it is by
far the largest object in the solar system. The Sun is more than 500
times the mass of everything else in the solar system combined! Listed
below is data on the sizes of the Sun and planets relative to Earth (
**Table** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6c29sYXJfc3lzdGVtX3NpemU.) ).

#### Distances in the Solar System {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlzdGFuY2VzIGluIHRoZSBTb2xhciBTeXN0ZW0._4-ado}

Distances in the solar system are often measured in **astronomical
units** (AU). One astronomical unit is defined as the distance from
Earth to the Sun. 1 AU equals about 150 million km (93 million miles).
Listed below is the distance from the Sun to each planet in AU (
**Table** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6RGlzdGFuY2VzX09yYml0cw..) ).
The table shows how long it takes each planet to spin once on its axis.
It also shows how long it takes each planet to complete an orbit. Notice
how slowly Venus rotates! A day on Venus is actually longer than a year
on Venus!

  **Planet**   **Average Distance from Sun (AU)**   **Length of Day (in Earth days)**   **Length of Year (in Earth years)**

**What's better than a field trip?**

All of the inner planets are orbited by man-made satellites. Jupiter and
Saturn have man-made satellites too. We can see what the planets look
like from the photos they take. The satellites also carry instruments
that collect a lot of important data. This is better than taking a field
trip to such hostile places. You can learn a lot while sitting your own,
very comfortable planet!

### The Inner Planets {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIElubmVyIFBsYW5ldHM._5-zks}

The four planets closest to the Sun—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are
the **inner planets** or **terrestrial planets** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjUtMTItSW5uZXItcGxhbmV0cw..) ). They
are similar to Earth. All are solid, dense, and rocky. None of the inner
planets has rings. Compared to the outer planets, the inner planets are
small. They have shorter orbits around the Sun and they spin more
slowly. Venus spins backward and spins the slowest of all the planets.

All of the inner planets were geologically active at one time. They are
all made of cooled igneous rock with inner iron cores. Earth has one
big, round moon, while Mars has two very small, irregular moons. Mercury
and Venus do not have moons.

### The Outer Planets {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE91dGVyIFBsYW5ldHM._5-3qs}

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the **outer planets** of our
solar system. These are the four planets farthest from the Sun. The
outer planets are much larger than the inner planets. Since they are
mostly made of gases, they are also called **gas giants** . Pictured
below are the relative sizes of the outer planets and the Sun (

**Figure 14.11**

This image shows the four outer planets and the Sun, with sizes to
scale. From left to right, the outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune.

</div>

The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium. These are the
same elements that make up most of the Sun. Astronomers think that most
of the nebula was hydrogen and helium. The inner planets lost these very
light gases. Their gravity was too low to keep them, and they floated
away into space. The Sun and the outer planets had enough gravity to
keep the hydrogen and helium.

All of the outer planets have numerous moons. They also have **planetary
rings** made of dust and other small particles. Only the rings of Saturn
can be easily seen from Earth.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-r9i}

-   The four inner planets have slower orbits, slower spin, no rings,
    and they are made of rock and metal.
-   The four outer planets have faster orbits and spins, a composition
    of gases and liquids, numerous moons, and rings.
-   The outer planets are made of hydrogen and helium, so they are
    called gas giants.

**What does this planet look like?**

Mercury looks a lot like Earth's Moon. Why do you think it does? Both
have been struck by a lot of asteroids. Both have no atmosphere, so
there is no weathering and erosion. If they had an atmosphere, many of
the craters would have been eroded away. Both have no plate tectonics to
transform the landscape. This would also remove a lot of craters.

### Mercury {#14.html#x-ck12-TWVyY3VyeQ.._6-uts}

**Mercury** is the smallest planet. It has no moon. It is also the
planet closest to the Sun. Pictured below is the surface of Mercury
covered with craters ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMDgtbWVyY3VyeS1jcmF0ZXJz) ), like
Earth’s Moon. Many of the impact craters are billions of years old. This
means that Mercury hasn’t changed much geologically for billions of
years. It has no plate tectonics. With only a trace of an atmosphere, it
has no weather to wear down the ancient craters.

#### Exploring Mercury {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhwbG9yaW5nIE1lcmN1cnk._6-ob1}

Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, it is difficult to observe from
Earth, even with a telescope. The Mariner 10 spacecraft did a flyby of
Mercury in 1974–1975. In 2004, the MESSENGER mission left Earth. On its
way to Mercury, it did one flyby of Earth, two of Venus, and three of
Mercury. In March 2011, MESSENGER became the first spacecraft to enter
an orbit around Mercury. To date, MESSENGER has taken over 100,000
images and has revealed many interesting features of the planet's
interior.

#### Short Year, Long Days {#14.html#x-ck12-U2hvcnQgWWVhciwgTG9uZyBEYXlz_6-ly5}

Mercury is named for the Roman messenger god. Mercury was a messenger
because he could run extremely fast. The Greeks gave the planet this
name because Mercury moves very quickly in its orbit around the Sun.
Mercury orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury has a very short
year, but it also has very long days. Mercury rotates slowly on its
axis, turning exactly three times for every two times it orbits the Sun.
Therefore, each day on Mercury is 58 Earth days long.

#### Extreme Temperatures {#14.html#x-ck12-RXh0cmVtZSBUZW1wZXJhdHVyZXM._6-toi}

Mercury is very close to the Sun, so it can get very hot. Mercury also
has virtually no atmosphere. As the planet rotates very slowly, the
temperature varies tremendously. In direct sunlight, the surface can be
as hot as 427°C (801°F). On the dark side, the surface can be as cold as
–183°C (–297°F)! The coldest temperatures may be on the insides of
craters. Most of Mercury is extremely dry. Scientists think that there
may be a small amount of water, in the form of ice, at the planet's
poles. The poles never receive direct sunlight.

#### A Liquid Metal Core {#14.html#x-ck12-QSBMaXF1aWQgTWV0YWwgQ29yZQ.._6-eqo}

Pictured below is a diagram of Mercury's interior ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMTAtbWVyY3VyeS1pbnRlcmlvcg..) ).
Mercury is one of the densest planets. Scientists think that the
interior contains a large core made mostly of melted iron. The inner
core may be solid. Mercury's core takes up about 85% of the planet's
radius.

**What's beneath Venus's clouds?**

This image was produced by the Magellan probe on a flyby. Radar waves
sent by the spacecraft reveal mountains, valleys, vast lava plains, and
canyons. The colors are not real. They enhance the features so we can
better see them.

### Venus {#14.html#x-ck12-VmVudXM._7-ewp}

Named after the Roman goddess of love, Venus is the only planet named
after a female. **Venus** is sometimes called Earth’s “sister planet.”
Venus is our nearest neighbor and is most like Earth in size. But Venus
is a lot different from Earth. Earth's life would not find the planet
very hospitable at all.

#### A Harsh Environment {#14.html#x-ck12-QSBIYXJzaCBFbnZpcm9ubWVudA.._7-xor}

Viewed through a telescope, Venus looks smooth and featureless. The
planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds. You can see the clouds in
pictures of Venus ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1WZW51c1RydWVDb2xvcg..) ).

**Figure 14.14**

Venus in real color. The planet is covered by a thick layer of clouds.

</div>

We make maps of the surface using radar because the thick clouds won’t
allow us to take photographs of the surface of Venus. This is shown in
the first image at the top.

#### Atmosphere {#14.html#x-ck12-QXRtb3NwaGVyZQ.._7-um4}

Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less
pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large
amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! Scientists think the color of
sunlight on Venus is reddish-brown.

The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of
Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at
Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong **greenhouse
effect** . As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is
farther from the Sun, Venus is even much hotter than Mercury.
Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to
melt lead!

#### Surface {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZQ.._7-0zo}

The surface of Venus is shrouded by thick clouds. Radar images show a
complex surface. There are volcanoes and craters like those found on
other planets and moons. The surface is not nearly as complex as the
surface of Earth.

#### Craters {#14.html#x-ck12-Q3JhdGVycw.._7-tsj}

There are a large number of craters on Venus. However, there are not
nearly as many as on Mercury or the Moon. So the planet's surface must
be fairly young. This suggests that the planet experiences volcanism and
has a hot interior.

#### Volcanoes {#14.html#x-ck12-Vm9sY2Fub2Vz_7-ozn}

Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet. There are between
100,000 and one million volcanoes on Venus! Most of the volcanoes are
now inactive.

Pictured below is an image made using radar data ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1WZW51c01hYXRNb25z) ). The volcano is
Maat Mons. Lava beds are in the foreground.

#### Motion and Appearance {#14.html#x-ck12-TW90aW9uIGFuZCBBcHBlYXJhbmNl_7-no4}

Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise as viewed from its North
Pole. All of the other planets rotate counterclockwise. Venus turns
slowly, making only one turn every 243 days. This is longer than a year
on Venus! It takes Venus only 225 days to orbit the Sun.

Because the orbit of Venus is inside Earth’s orbit, Venus always appears
close to the Sun. You can see Venus rising early in the morning, just
before the Sun rises ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1WZW51c0FuZE1vb25Jbk1vcm5pbmc.) ). For
this reason, Venus is sometimes called “the morning star.” When it sets
in the evening, just after the Sun sets, it may be called “the evening
star.” Since planets only reflect the Sun’s light, Venus should not be
called a star at all! Venus is very bright because its clouds reflect
sunlight very well. Venus is the brightest object in the sky besides the
Sun and the Moon.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-qdj}

-   Venus has a very thick, toxic atmosphere.
-   Venus has lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The atmosphere
    has a very strong greenhouse effect and therefore traps a lot
    of heat.
-   Venus has fewer impact craters than Mercury or the Moon. Venus has a
    lot of volcanoes, including some very large ones.

**Would you like to go on this field trip?**

The most amazing "field trips" in human history took place in the Apollo
program. Between 1969 and 1972, six manned spaceships landed on the
Moon. Human astronauts walked on the Moon. They brought back soil and
rock samples. No human has visited Earth's satellite since 1972. There
is talk of someday returning, but there are no concrete plans.

### Earth’s Moon {#14.html#x-ck12-RWFydGjigJlzIE1vb24._8-ga5}

The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite. The Moon is about one-fourth
the size of Earth, 3,476 kilometers in diameter. Gravity on the Moon is
only one-sixth as strong as it is on Earth. If you weigh 120 pounds on
Earth, you would only weigh 20 pounds on the Moon. You can jump six
times as high on the Moon as you can on Earth. The Moon makes no light
of its own. Like every other body in the solar system, it only reflects
light from the Sun.

#### Orbit {#14.html#x-ck12-T3JiaXQ._8-6kz}

The Moon rotates on its axis once for every orbit it makes around Earth.
What does this mean? This means that the same side of the Moon always
faces Earth. The side of the Moon that always faces Earth is called the
near side. The side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth is
called the far side. From Earth, people have only seen the Moon's near
side. The far side has only been seen by spacecraft and Apollo
astronauts.

#### Atmosphere {#14.html#x-ck12-QXRtb3NwaGVyZQ.._8-37w}

The Moon has no atmosphere. With no atmosphere, the Moon is not
protected from extreme temperatures. The average surface temperature
during the day is approximately 107°C (225°F). Daytime temperatures can
reach as high as 123°C (253°F). At night, the average temperature drops
to -153°C (-243°F). The lowest temperatures measured are as low as
-233°C (-397°F).

#### Lunar Surface {#14.html#x-ck12-THVuYXIgU3VyZmFjZQ.._8-uqu}

We all know what the Moon looks like. It's always looked the same during
our lifetime. In fact, the Moon has looked the same to every person who
has looked up at it for all time. Even the dinosaurs, trilobites, or
cyanobacteria, should they have looked up at it, would have seen
more-or-less the same thing. This is not true of Earth. Natural
processes continually alter Earth’s surface. Without these processes,
would Earth's surface resemble the Moon's? The Moon does have more
craters than it did in the long distant past, of course.

Even though we can't see it from Earth, the Moon has changed recently
too. Astronauts' footprints are now on the Moon. They will remain
unchanged for thousands of years, because there is no wind, rain, or
living thing to disturb them. A falling meteorite could destroy them.
Tiny micrometeorites bombard the Moon's surface and smooth it over time
too.

#### Craters {#14.html#x-ck12-Q3JhdGVycw.._8-q7n}

The landscape of the Moon—its surface features—is very different from
Earth. The lunar landscape is covered by **craters** caused by meteoroid
impacts ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMTUtTW9vbi1DcmF0ZXJz) ). ( **Lunar**
means relating to the Moon.) The craters are bowl-shaped basins on the
Moon’s surface. Because the Moon has no water, wind, or weather, the
craters remain unchanged.

The Moon's coldest temperatures are found deep in the craters. The
coldest craters are at the south pole on the Moon's far side. The Sun
never shines on the bottoms of the deepest craters. These temperatures
are amongst the coldest in our entire solar system.

Craters, like the one shown in this image, are found on the surface of
the Moon.

#### Maria {#14.html#x-ck12-TWFyaWE._8-8za}

When you look at the Moon from Earth, you notice dark and light areas.
The **maria** are dark, solid, flat areas of lava (mostly basalt). Maria
covers around 16% of the Moon’s surface, mostly on the near side. The
maria formed about 3.0 to 4.0 billion years ago, when the Moon was
continually bombarded by meteoroids ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMTYtTW9vbi1tYXJlLWhpZ2hsYW5kcw..) ).
Large meteorites broke through the Moon’s newly formed surface. This
eventually caused magma to flow out and fill the craters. Scientists
estimate volcanic activity on the Moon ended about 1.2 billion years
ago.

**Figure 14.18**

Maria (the dark areas) and terrae (the light areas) cover the Moon.

</div>

#### Terrae {#14.html#x-ck12-VGVycmFl_8-hzs}

The lighter parts on the Moon are called **terrae** , or highlands (
**Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMTYtTW9vbi1tYXJlLWhpZ2hsYW5kcw..) ).
They are higher than the maria and include several high mountain ranges.
The rock that makes up the highlands is mostly composed of feldspar,
which is lighter in color and crystallized more slowly than the maria.
The rock looks light because it reflects more of the Sun’s light.

The figure below shows the near and far sides of the Moon ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjQtMTMtYW5kLTE0LU5lYXItRmFyLU1vb24.) ).
They are different!

The Mare Moscoviense is one of the few maria, or dark, flat areas, on
the far side.

</div>

The rocks of the terrae formed while the lunar magma ocean cooled just
after the Moon formed. The maria formed later.

#### Water {#14.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXI._8-kt3}

There are no lakes, rivers, or even small puddles anywhere to be found
on the Moon's surface. So there is no running water and no atmosphere.
This means that there is no erosion. Natural processes continually alter
Earth’s surface. Without these processes, our planet’s surface would be
covered with meteorite craters just like the Moon. Many moons in our
solar system have cratered surfaces.

NASA scientists have discovered a large number of water molecules mixed
in with lunar dirt. There is also surface water ice in some of the
frigid places that are always in shadow. Even though there is a very
small amount of water, there is no atmosphere. Temperatures are extreme.
So it comes as no surprise that there has not been evidence of life on
the Moon.

#### Lunar Interior {#14.html#x-ck12-THVuYXIgSW50ZXJpb3I._8-lko}

Like Earth, the Moon has a distinct crust, mantle, and core. The crust
is composed of igneous rock. This rock is rich in the elements oxygen,
silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. On the near side, the Moon’s crust is
about 30 kilometers thick. On the far side, the crust is about 100
kilometers thick. The mantle is made of rock like Earth’s upper mantle.
The Moon has a small metallic core, perhaps 300 to 500 kilometers in
diameter. The composition of the core is probably mostly iron with some
sulfur and nickel. We learned this both from the rock samples gathered
by astronauts and from spacecraft sent to the Moon.

#### Exploration {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhwbG9yYXRpb24._8-iq6}

Humans have walked on only two planetary bodies: Earth and the Moon. The
footprints the men left behind are the first signs of life ever on the
Moon. Scientists learned a great deal about the Moon from the Apollo
missions. The samples that were brought back have been studied in
laboratories. We know an incredible amount about the Moon because of
these samples. Having these rocks radically changed our thinking about
the Moon.

The Moon is easily seen from Earth. Early astronomers used telescopes to
study and map its surface. The Moon has also seen a great number of
satellites, rovers, and orbiters. After all, it is relatively easy to
get spacecraft to the satellite. Also, before humans could be safely
sent to the Moon, many studies and experiments had to be completed.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-su5}

-   The Moon revolves around Earth as they orbit the Sun. The same side
    of Moon always faces Earth.
-   The lunar surface has dark basalt maria. The light highlands are
    called terrae.
-   The Moon has a crust, mantle, and core.
-   The Moon has no atmosphere and only a very tiny amount of water.

**How do we get such incredible views of other planets?**

Mars is close, and it's not obscured by its atmosphere like Venus is.
The Hubble Space Telescope took this incredible photo of Mars. This is a
true color photo: the red is soil, the white is the polar ice cap, the
dark is basalt. Mars has many features like Earth's, but Mars is missing
one very important feature: an ocean.

### Mars {#14.html#x-ck12-TWFycw.._9-h65}

**Mars** is the fourth planet from the Sun. The Red Planet is the first
planet beyond Earth’s orbit.

Mars’ atmosphere is thin compared to Earth's. This means that there is
much lower pressure at the surface. Mars also has a weak greenhouse
effect, so temperatures are only slightly higher than they would be if
the planet did not have an atmosphere. The Martian climate is most like
Earth's of any planet in the solar system.

#### Exploration {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhwbG9yYXRpb24._9-mvx}

Mars is the easiest planet to observe. As a result, it has been studied
more than any other planet besides Earth. People can stand on Earth and
observe the planet through a telescope. We have also sent many space
probes to Mars. A car-sized robotic rover, Curiosity, arrived on the Red
Planet in August 2012. Curiosity joins Opportunity, which has been
active since 2004.

No humans have ever set foot on Mars. NASA and the European Space Agency
have plans to send people to Mars. The goal is to do it sometime between
2030 and 2040. The expense and danger of these missions are phenomenal.

#### Surface Features {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VyZmFjZSBGZWF0dXJlcw.._9-eot}

Mars has mountains, canyons, and other features similar to Earth. But it
doesn’t have as much geological activity as Earth. There is no evidence
of plate tectonics on Mars. There are also more craters on Mars than on
Earth. But there are fewer craters than on the Moon. What does this
suggest to you regarding Mars' tectonic history? Pictured below is an
image of the Martian surface ( **Figure**

Mars is Earth's second nearest neighbor planet.

</div>

#### A Red Planet {#14.html#x-ck12-QSBSZWQgUGxhbmV0_9-boc}

Viewed from Earth, Mars is red. This is due to large amounts of iron in
the soil. The ancient Greeks and Romans named the planet Mars after the
god of war because the planet's red color reminded them of blood. Mars
has only a very thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.

#### Volcanoes {#14.html#x-ck12-Vm9sY2Fub2Vz_9-9k4}

Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system: Olympus Mons (
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMTYtT2x5bXB1cy1Nb25z) ).
Olympus Mons is a shield volcano. The volcano is similar to the
volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands. But Olympus Mons is a giant, about 27
km (16.8 miles; 88,580 ft) tall. That's three times taller than Mount
Everest! At its base, Olympus Mons is about the size of the entire state
of Arizona, about 624 km (374 miles) across.

#### Canyons {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2FueW9ucw.._9-ox5}

Mars also has the largest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris (
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1WYWxsZXNNYXJpbmVyaXM.) ).
This canyon is 4,000 km (2,500 miles) long. That's as long as Europe is
wide! One-fifth of the circumference of Mars is covered by the canyon.
Valles Marineris is 7 km (4.3 miles) deep. How about Earth's Grand
Canyon? Earth's most famous canyon is only 446 km (277 miles) long and
about 2 km (1.2 miles) deep. Valles Marineris is thought to be a
tectonic crack in the Martian crust.

#### Is There Water on Mars? {#14.html#x-ck12-SXMgVGhlcmUgV2F0ZXIgb24gTWFycz8._9-ua5}

Water on Mars can't be a liquid. This is because the pressure of the
atmosphere is too low. The planet does have a lot of water; it is in the
form of ice. The south pole of Mars has a very visible ice cap.
Scientists also have evidence that there is also a lot of ice just under
the Martian surface. The ice melts when volcanoes erupt. At these times
liquid water flows across the surface.

Curiosity, the rover, has found evidence of a flowing stream on Mars.
Layers of smooth, water-polished pebbles have been photographed. This is
exactly what you would see in a stream on Earth. There are many surface
features that look like water-eroded canyons. Since there was liquid
water on Mars, scientists think that life might have existed there in
the past. One of Curiosity's tasks is to sample the soil to search for
carbon and other evidence of life.

#### Two Martian Moons {#14.html#x-ck12-VHdvIE1hcnRpYW4gTW9vbnM._9-fhw}

Mars has two very small, irregular moons, Phobos ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1QaG9ib3M.) ) and Deimos. These moons
were discovered in 1877. They are named after the two sons of Ares, who
followed their father into war. The moons were probably asteroids that
were captured by Martian gravity.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-zoq}

-   Mars is the easiest planet to study because it doesn't have thick
    clouds obscuring its surface. It is also close to Earth.
-   The surface of Mars has volcanoes and canyons. There is a polar ice
    cap and channels that were once filled with water. Curiosity has
    found evidence of a flowing stream.
-   Mars has two moons that are thought to be captured asteroids.

**What are Jupiter's most distinctive features?**

Jupiter has been well studied for being so far away. Many flybys, one
orbiter, and a probe have all visited the planet. While the possibility
exists for humans to reach Mars, a manned trip to Jupiter seems a long
ways away. The round trip would take at least 10 years. Who would want
to spend more than a decade on a spaceship? At least they could see the
Great Red Spot and other features in person!

### Jupiter {#14.html#x-ck12-SnVwaXRlcg.._10-jyv}

**Jupiter** is the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is named
for the king of the gods in Roman mythology. The Romans named the
largest planet for their most important god. They followed the tradition
of the Greeks, who had similarly named the planet Zeus. The Romans built
a temple to Jupiter on the hill.

Jupiter is truly a giant! The planet has 318 times the mass of Earth,
and over 1,300 times Earth’s volume. So Jupiter is much less dense than
Earth. Because Jupiter is so large, it reflects a lot of sunlight. When
it is visible, it is the brightest object in the night sky besides the
Moon and Venus. Jupiter is quite far from Earth. The planet is more than
five times as far from Earth as the Sun. It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth
years to orbit once around the Sun.

#### A Ball of Gas and Liquid {#14.html#x-ck12-QSBCYWxsIG9mIEdhcyBhbmQgTGlxdWlk_10-3uv}

Since Jupiter is a gas giant, could a spacecraft land on its surface?
The answer is no. There is no solid surface at all! Jupiter is made
mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of other
elements. The outer layers of the planet are gas. Deeper within the
planet, the intense pressure condenses the gases into a liquid. Jupiter
may have a small rocky core at its center.

#### A Stormy Atmosphere {#14.html#x-ck12-QSBTdG9ybXkgQXRtb3NwaGVyZQ.._10-mj4}

Jupiter's atmosphere is unlike any other in the solar system! The upper
layer contains clouds of ammonia. The ammonia is different colored
bands. These bands rotate around the planet. The ammonia also swirls
around in tremendous storms. The **Great Red Spot** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmVhdFJlZFNwb3Q.) ) is Jupiter's
most noticeable feature. The spot is an enormous, oval-shaped storm. It
is more than three times as wide as Earth! Clouds in the storm rotate
counterclockwise. They make one complete turn every six days or so. The
Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter for at least 300 years. It may have
been observed as early as 1664. It is possible that this storm is a
permanent feature on Jupiter. No one knows for sure.

powerful enough to see it.

</div>

#### Moons and Rings {#14.html#x-ck12-TW9vbnMgYW5kIFJpbmdz_10-xud}

Jupiter has lots of moons. As of 2012, we have discovered over 66
natural satellites of Jupiter. Four are big enough and bright enough to
be seen from Earth using a pair of binoculars. These four moons were
first discovered by Galileo in 1610. They are called the **Galilean
moons** . The figure below shows the four Galilean moons and their sizes
relative to each other ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HYWxpbGVhblNhdGVsbGl0ZXM.) ). These
moons are named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The Galilean moons
are larger than even the biggest dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris. Ganymede
is the biggest moon in the solar system. It is even larger than the
planet Mercury!

**Figure 14.25**

The Galilean moons are as large as small planets.

</div>

Scientists think that Europa is a good place to look for
extraterrestrial life. Europa is the smallest of the Galilean moons. The
moon's surface is a smooth layer of ice. Scientists think that the ice
may sit on top of an ocean of liquid water. How could Europa have liquid
water when it is so far from the Sun? Europa is heated by Jupiter.
Jupiter's tidal forces are so great that they stretch and squash its
moon. This could produce enough heat for there to be liquid water.
Numerous missions have been planned to explore Europa, including plans
to drill through the ice and send a probe into the ocean. However, no
such mission has yet been attempted.

Photos from the Voyager missions showed that Jupiter has a ring system.
This ring system is very faint, so it is very difficult to observe from
Earth.

#### Exploration {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhwbG9yYXRpb24._10-dgo}

Jupiter has fascinated scientists at least since Galileo turned his
first telescope on the planet. In 1979, two spacecrafts, Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2, visited Jupiter and its moons. The Galileo orbiter orbited
the planet for seven years and flew by all of the Galilean moons plus
one other moon. The orbiter released a probe to study the planet's
atmosphere. Future missions to Jupiter are underway. Juno will arrive in
late 2016.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-pgn}

-   Jupiter is mostly hydrogen with some helium, and may contain a small
    rocky core.
-   Jupiter has a thick atmosphere. The Great Red Spot is a storm that
    has been going for at least 300 years.
-   One of Jupiter's moons, Europa, appears to have a liquid ocean
    beneath the surface. This ocean could be a place for life.

**If you could take a trip to Saturn, what would you see?**

This storm was captured by the Cassini spacecraft. It was the most
intense storm seen on Saturn since Cassini began orbiting Saturn eight
years ago. The storm went on for several weeks. Of course, a human
orbiting Saturn might be most fascinated by the planet's beautiful
rings.

### Saturn {#14.html#x-ck12-U2F0dXJu_11-3a0}

**Saturn** is the second largest planet in the solar system ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TYXR1cm4.) ). Saturn’s mass is about
95 times Earth's mass. The gas giant is 755 times Earth’s volume.
Despite its large size, Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar
system. Saturn is actually less dense than water. This means that if
there were a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float! In Roman mythology,
Saturn was the father of Jupiter. Saturn orbits the Sun once about every
30 Earth years.

#### Composition {#14.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG9zaXRpb24._11-vmx}

Saturn’s composition is similar to Jupiter's. The planet is made mostly
of hydrogen and helium. These elements are gases in the outer layers and
liquids in the deeper layers. Saturn may also have a small solid core.
Saturn's upper atmosphere has clouds in bands of different colors. These
clouds rotate rapidly around the planet. But Saturn has fewer storms
than Jupiter. Thunder and lightning have been seen in the storms on
Saturn.

#### Rings {#14.html#x-ck12-UmluZ3M._11-eza}

Saturn's rings were first observed by Galileo in 1610. Remember that his
telescope was not very good. He didn't know they were rings and thought
that they were two large moons. One moon was on either side of the
planet. In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens realized that
they were rings circling Saturn’s equator. The rings appear tilted. This
is because Saturn is tilted about 27 degrees to its side.

The Voyager 1 spacecraft visited Saturn in 1980. Voyager 2 followed in
1981. These probes sent back detailed pictures of Saturn, its rings, and
some of its moons ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1TYXR1cm5VbmxpdFJpbmdz) ). From the
Voyager data, we learned what Saturn’s rings are made of. They are
particles of water and ice with a little bit of dust. There are several
gaps in the rings. These gaps were cleared out by moons within the
rings. Gravity attracts dust and gas to the moon from the ring. This
leaves a gap in the rings. Other gaps in the rings are caused by the
competing forces of Saturn and its moons outside the rings.

The rings of Saturn.

</div>

Scientists think that there are two possibilities for how Saturn's rings
formed. One possibility is by the breakup of one of Saturn’s moons. The
other possibility is from material that never made it into the planet
when Saturn originally formed.

An animation of dark spokes in Saturn’s rings is seen here:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Saturn\_ring\_spokes\_PIA11144\_300px\_secs15.5to23\_20080926.ogv](File:Saturn_ring_spokes_PIA11144_300px_secs15.5to23_20080926.ogv)
. The spokes appear seasonally and their origin is as yet unknown.

#### Moons {#14.html#x-ck12-TW9vbnM._11-yj7}

As of 2012, 62 natural moons have been identified around Saturn. Only
seven of Saturn’s moons are round. All but one is smaller than Earth’s
moon. Some of the very small moons are found within the rings. All the
particles in the rings are like little moons, because they orbit around
Saturn. Someone must decide which ones are large enough to call moons.

Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, is about one and a half times the size of
Earth’s moon. Titan is even larger than the planet Mercury. The picture
below compares the size of Titan to Earth ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1UaXRhbkVhcnRoQ29tcGFyaXNvbg..) ).
Scientists are very interested in Titan. The moon has an atmosphere that
is thought to be like Earth’s first atmosphere with nitrogen and
methane. This atmosphere was around before life developed on Earth. Like
Jupiter's moon, Europa, Titan may have a layer of liquid water under a
layer of ice. Scientists now think that there are lakes on Titan's
surface. Don't take a dip, though. These lakes contain liquid methane
and ethane instead of water! Methane and ethane are compounds found in
natural gas.

**What is this blue ball?**

Uranus is so far away that there has been relatively little exploration
of the planet. The closest approach was a flyby by Voyager 2 in 1986.
Great images have also been taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

### Uranus {#14.html#x-ck12-VXJhbnVz_12-wiu}

**Uranus** is named for the Greek god of the sky, the father of Saturn.
Astronomers pronounce the name “YOOR-uh-nuhs.” Uranus was not known to
ancient observers. The planet was first discovered with a telescope by
the astronomer William Herschel in 1781.

Uranus is faint because it is very far away. Its distance from the Sun
is 2.8 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles). A photon from the Sun
takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus. Uranus orbits the
Sun once about every 84 Earth years.

#### An Icy Blue-Green Ball {#14.html#x-ck12-QW4gSWN5IEJsdWUtR3JlZW4gQmFsbA.._12-yl4}

Uranus is a lot like Jupiter and Saturn. The planet is composed in part
of hydrogen and helium. There is a thick layer of gas on the outside.
Farther on the inside is liquid. But Uranus has a higher percentage of
icy materials than Jupiter and Saturn. These materials include water,
ammonia, and methane. Uranus is also different because of its blue-green
color. Clouds of methane filter out red light. This leaves a blue-green
color. The atmosphere of Uranus has bands of clouds. These clouds are
hard to see in normal light. The result is that the planet looks like a
plain blue ball.

Uranus is the least massive outer planet. Its mass is only about 14
times the mass of Earth. Like all of the outer planets, Uranus is much
less dense than Earth. Gravity is actually weaker than on Earth’s
surface. If you were at the top of the clouds on Uranus, you would weigh
about 10 percent less than what you weigh on Earth.

#### The Sideways Planet {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNpZGV3YXlzIFBsYW5ldA.._12-jpu}

All of the planets rotate on their axes in the same direction that they
move around the Sun. Except for Uranus. Uranus is tilted on its side.
Its axis is almost parallel to its orbit. So Uranus rolls along like a
bowling ball as it revolves around the Sun. How did Uranus get this way?
Scientists think that the planet was struck and knocked over by another
planet-sized object. This collision probably took place billions of
years ago.

#### Rings and Moons of Uranus {#14.html#x-ck12-UmluZ3MgYW5kIE1vb25zIG9mIFVyYW51cw.._12-bx9}

Uranus has a faint system of rings ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1VcmFudXNSaW5nc0h1YmJsZQ..) ). The
rings circle the planet’s equator. However, Uranus is tilted on its
side. So the rings are almost perpendicular to the planet’s orbit.

**Does this photo give you an idea of how Neptune got its name?**

Because of its blue color, Neptune was named for the Roman god of the
sea. The blue is not a planetary ocean though!

### Neptune {#14.html#x-ck12-TmVwdHVuZQ.._13-e2o}

**Neptune** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1OZXB0dW5lU3Rvcm1z) ) is the eighth
planet from the Sun. Neptune is so far away you need a telescope to see
it from Earth. Neptune is the most distant planet in our solar system.
It is nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun.
One orbit around the Sun takes Neptune 165 Earth years.

Neptune has a great dark spot at the center left and a small dark spot
at the bottom center.

</div>

#### Discovery {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlzY292ZXJ5_13-qt8}

Scientists guessed Neptune's existence before it was discovered. Uranus
did not always appear exactly where it should. They said this was
because a planet beyond Uranus was pulling on it. This gravitational
pull was affecting its orbit. Neptune was discovered in 1846. It was
just where scientists predicted it would be!

Uranus and Neptune are often considered “sister planets.” They are very
similar to each other. Neptune has slightly more mass than Uranus, but
it is slightly smaller in size.

#### Extremes of Cold and Wind {#14.html#x-ck12-RXh0cmVtZXMgb2YgQ29sZCBhbmQgV2luZA.._13-gq6}

Like Uranus, Neptune is blue. The blue color is caused by gases in its
atmosphere, including methane. Neptune is not a smooth looking ball like
Uranus. The planet has a few darker and lighter spots. When Voyager 2
visited Neptune in 1986, there was a large dark-blue spot south of the
equator. This spot was called the Great Dark Spot. When the Hubble Space
Telescope photographed Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had
disappeared. Another dark spot had appeared north of the equator.
Astronomers believe that both of these spots represent gaps in the
methane clouds on Neptune.

Neptune's appearance changes due to its turbulent atmosphere. Winds are
stronger than on any other planet in the solar system. Wind speeds can
reach 1,100 km/h (700 mph). This is close to the speed of sound! The
rapid winds surprised astronomers. This is because Neptune receives
little energy from the Sun to power weather systems. It is not
surprising that Neptune is one of the coldest places in the solar
system. Temperatures at the top of the clouds are about –218°C (–360°F).

#### Neptune’s Rings and Moons {#14.html#x-ck12-TmVwdHVuZeKAmXMgUmluZ3MgYW5kIE1vb25z_13-kn7}

Like the other outer planets, Neptune has rings of ice and dust. These
rings are much thinner and fainter than Saturn's. Neptune's rings may be
unstable. They may change or disappear in a relatively short time.

Neptune has 13 known moons. Only Triton ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Ucml0b24.) ) has enough mass to be
round. Triton orbits in the direction opposite Neptune's orbit.
Scientists think Triton did not form around Neptune. The satellite was
captured by Neptune’s gravity as it passed by.

-   Neptune is so far from Earth that it can't be seen without
    a telescope.
-   Neptune has a turbulent atmosphere. The turbulence changes the
    planet's appearance. The blue color is due to frozen methane.

**Are you surprised by exoplanets?**

Scientists have always thought there had to be planets outside our solar
system. They just couldn't see them. Now that there are ways to find
exoplanets, it turns out that there are many of them. In this artist's
depiction, the star Gliese 436 is a dwarf star and is reddish because it
is cool. The planet has recently been discovered. It is the size of
Neptune and orbits its star every 2.6 days.

### Extrasolar Planets {#14.html#x-ck12-RXh0cmFzb2xhciBQbGFuZXRz_14-nlo}

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered other solar systems.
A solar system has one or more planets orbiting one or more stars. We
call these planets “extrasolar planets,” or **exoplanets** . They are
called exoplanets because they orbit a star other than the Sun. As of
April 2014, more than 4,600 exoplanets have been found, with 1706
confirmed. The rate of discovery is increasing rapidly! You can check
out how many we have found at [http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/]() .

Exoplanets are very far away, and they are relatively tiny. So we have
been able to take pictures of only a few exoplanets. Most are discovered
because of some tell-tale signs. One sign is a very slight motion of a
star that must be caused by the pull of a planet.

An animation showing how this looks is seen here from above:
[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Orbit3.gif](Orbit3.gif)
. This is in line with the plane of the system:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dopspec-inline.gif](File:Dopspec-inline.gif)
.

Another sign is the partial dimming of a star’s light as the planet
passes in front of it.

#### Life {#14.html#x-ck12-TGlmZQ.._14-eaf}

If life exists elsewhere in the Universe, it is almost certainly on an
exoplanet. Which exoplanets could have life? Probably those that are
most like Earth. Kepler-22b is the Earth-zone of a Sun-like star. This
means that the planet is the right distance from its star for life. The
planet could have liquid water, which is necessary for life on Earth.
Scientists do not know if there is life on Kepler-22b and won't for a
long time. It's fun to think about though! An artist's depiction of
Kepler-22b is pictured below ( **Figure**

**Is this rock an asteroid?**

This rock is somewhat round. It is called asteroid Vesta, but it may
actually be a protoplanet: too round to be an asteroid, not round enough
to be a dwarf planet. This image was taken of Vesta as a spacecraft
orbited it for a year. Scientists are interested in asteroids for many
reasons. They are remnants from the early solar system. Asteroids
sometimes cause mass extinctions.

### Asteroids {#14.html#x-ck12-QXN0ZXJvaWRz_15-dgs}

After the Sun and planets formed, there was some material left over.
These small chunks didn't get close enough to a large body to be pulled
in by its gravity. They now inhabit the solar system as asteroids and
comets.

**Asteroids** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1JZGFBbmREYWN0eWw.) ) are very small,
irregularly shaped, rocky bodies. Asteroids orbit the Sun, but they are
more like giant rocks than planets. Since they are small, they have
features that are different from planets. Asteroids do not have enough
gravity to become round. They are too small to have an atmosphere. With
no internal heat, they are not geologically active.

An asteroid can only change due to a collision. A collision may cause
the asteroid to break up. It may create craters on the asteroid’s
surface. An asteroid may strike a planet if it comes near enough to be
pulled in by its gravity.

#### The Asteroid Belt {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEFzdGVyb2lkIEJlbHQ._15-zhv}

Hundreds of thousands of asteroids have been found in our solar system.
They are still being discovered at a rate of about 5,000 new asteroids
per month! The majority are located in between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter. This region is called the **asteroid belt** ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Bc3Rlcm9pZEJlbHQ.) ). There are many
thousands of asteroids in the asteroid belt. Still, their total mass
adds up to only about four percent of Earth’s Moon.

Asteroids formed at the same time as the rest of the solar system.
Although there are many in the asteroid belt, they were never able to
form into a planet. Jupiter's gravity kept them apart.

#### Near-Earth Asteroids {#14.html#x-ck12-TmVhci1FYXJ0aCBBc3Rlcm9pZHM._15-mlx}

**Near-Earth asteroids** have orbits that cross Earth’s orbit. This
means that they can collide with Earth. There are over 4,500 known
near-Earth asteroids. Small asteroids do sometimes collide with Earth.
An asteroid about 5–10 m in diameter hits about once per year. Five
hundred to a thousand of the known near-Earth asteroids are much bigger.
They are over 1 kilometer in diameter. When large asteroids hit Earth in
the past, many organisms died. At times, many species became extinct in
a mass extinction. Astronomers keep looking for near-Earth asteroids.
They hope to predict a possible collision early so they can to try to
stop it.

#### Asteroid Missions {#14.html#x-ck12-QXN0ZXJvaWQgTWlzc2lvbnM._15-yrn}

Scientists are very interested in asteroids. Most are composed of
material that has not changed since early in the solar system.
Scientists can learn a lot from them about how the solar system formed.
Asteroids may be important for space travel. They could be mined for
rare minerals or for construction projects in space.

Scientists have sent spacecrafts to study asteroids. In 1997, the NEAR
Shoemaker probe orbited the asteroid 433 Eros. The craft finally landed
on its surface in 2001. The Japanese Hayabusa probe returned to Earth
with samples of a small near-Earth asteroid in 2010. The U.S. Dawn
mission spent a year in orbit around Vesta ending in August 2012.

**Is this comet going to hit?**

Astronauts on board the International Space Station witness incredible
things. This photo of Comet Lovejoy was taken in December 2011. Although
it looks like its going to strike Earth, it was not even visible from
our planet by the naked eye. The comet is now traveling far out into
space.

### Comets {#14.html#x-ck12-Q29tZXRz_16-itx}

**Comets** are small, icy objects that have very elliptical orbits
around the Sun. Their orbits carry them from the outer solar system to
the inner solar system, close to the Sun. Early in Earth’s history,
comets may have brought water and other substances to Earth during
collisions.

Comet tails form as the comet flies close to the Sun and the outer
layers of ice melt and form a glowing coma. Particles streaming from the
Sun push this gas and dust into a long tail. The tail always points away
from the Sun. The coma is bright because it reflects light from the Sun
( **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Db21ldEhhbGVCb3BwMg..)
). Comets appear for only a short time when they are near the Sun. They
seem to disappear as they move back to the outer solar system.

**Figure 14.37**

Comet Hale-Bopp, also called the Great Comet of 1997. The comet has two
visible tails: a bright, curved dust tail and a fainter, straight tail
of ions (charged atoms) pointing directly away from the Sun.

</div>

The time between one appearance of a comet and the next is called the
comet’s period. Halley’s comet, with a period of 75 years, will next be
seen in 2061. The first mention of the comet in historical records may
go back as much as two millennia.

#### Where Comets Come From {#14.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgQ29tZXRzIENvbWUgRnJvbQ.._16-teu}

Short-period comets have periods of about 200 years or less. These
comets come from a region beyond the orbit of Neptune called the
**Kuiper belt** (pronounced “KI-per”). The Kuiper belt also contains
asteroids and at least two dwarf planets.

Comets with periods as long as thousands or even millions of years come
from a very distant region of the solar system. This region is called
the Oort cloud. It is about 50,000-100,000 AU from the Sun
(50,000–100,000 times the distance from the Sun to Earth).

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-sht}

-   Comets are icy objects that have very elliptical orbits around
    the Sun.
-   Comet tails form as ice vaporizes and glows in the Sun's light.
-   Short-period comets come from the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune, and
    long-period comets come from the Oort cloud far out away from
    the Sun.

**Is this a comet?**

When a meteor shoots through the atmosphere, it burns and glows. When we
look up and see one, we call it a shooting star. In this image, the
meteor looks like a comet. No need to go anywhere to see this. Just try
to catch one of these meteor showers: the Perseids in mid-August or the
Geminids in mid-December. Look for information on the dates and whether
the Moon will not be lighting up the sky.

### Meteors {#14.html#x-ck12-TWV0ZW9ycw.._17-eqx}

If you look at the sky on a dark night, you may see a **meteor** (
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FU1BlcnNlaWRNZXRlb3JTaG93ZXI.)
). A meteor forms a streak of light across the sky. People call them
shooting stars because that's what they look like. But meteors are not
stars at all. The light you see comes from a small piece of matter
burning up as it flies through Earth's atmosphere.

#### Meteoroids {#14.html#x-ck12-TWV0ZW9yb2lkcw.._17-gbe}

Before these small pieces of matter enter Earth’s atmosphere, they are
called **meteoroids** . Meteoroids are as large as boulders or as small
as tiny sand grains. Larger objects are called asteroids; smaller
objects are interplanetary dust. Meteoroids sometimes cluster together
in long trails. They are the debris left behind by comets. When Earth
passes through a comet trail, there is a **meteor shower** . During a
meteor shower, there are many more meteors than normal for a night or
two.

Click on the image above for more content

#### Meteorites {#14.html#x-ck12-TWV0ZW9yaXRlcw.._17-tqn}

A meteoroid is dragged toward Earth by gravity and enters the
atmosphere. Friction with the atmosphere heats the object quickly, so it
starts to vaporize. As it flies through the atmosphere, it leaves a
trail of glowing gases. The object is now a meteor. Most meteors
vaporize in the atmosphere. They never reach Earth’s surface. Large
meteoroids may not burn up entirely in the atmosphere. A small core may
remain and hit Earth’s surface. This is called a **meteorite** .

Meteorites provide clues about our solar system. Many were formed in the
early solar system ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMzQtbWV0ZW9yaXRl) ). Some are from
asteroids that have split apart. A few are rocks from nearby bodies like
Mars. For this to happen, an asteroid smashed into Mars and sent up
debris. A bit of the debris entered Earth’s atmosphere as a meteor.

**What is, and what is not, a planet?**

Pluto just didn't fit the criteria for a planet, so it was placed in a
new category with others of its kind, dwarf planets. So what is a
planet, and what is Pluto?

### What is a Planet? {#14.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBhIFBsYW5ldD8._18-9o0}

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that there were
too many questions surrounding what could be called a planet, and so
refined the definition of a planet.

According to the new definition, a planet must:

-   Orbit a star.
-   Be big enough that its own gravity causes it to be shaped as
    a sphere.
-   Be small enough that it isn’t a star itself.
-   Have cleared the area of its orbit of smaller objects.

### Dwarf Planets {#14.html#x-ck12-RHdhcmYgUGxhbmV0cw.._18-y9f}

The **dwarf planets** of our solar system are exciting proof of how much
we are learning about our solar system. With the discovery of many new
objects in our solar system, astronomers refined the definition of a
dwarf planet in 2006.

According to the IAU, a dwarf planet must:

-   Orbit a star.
-   Have enough mass to be nearly spherical.
-   Not have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects.
-   Not be a moon.

So dwarf planets are like planets except for one thing. They have not
cleared their orbits of smaller objects. They do not have enough gravity
to do this. There are five recognized dwarf planets in the solar system:
Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.

#### Pluto {#14.html#x-ck12-UGx1dG8._18-y9g}

The reclassification of Pluto to the new category dwarf planet stirred
up a great deal of controversy. How the classification of Pluto has
evolved is an interesting story in science.

From the time it was discovered in 1930 until the early 2000s, Pluto was
considered the ninth planet. When astronomers first located Pluto, the
telescopes were not as good. Pluto and its moon, Charon, were seen as
one much larger object ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjUtNTMtUGx1dG8tYW5kLWl0cy1tb29u) ).
With better telescopes, astronomers realized that Pluto was much smaller
than they had thought.

**Figure 14.40**

Pluto and its moon, Charon, are actually two objects.

</div>

Better technology also allowed astronomers to discover many smaller
objects like Pluto that orbit the Sun. One of them, Eris, discovered in
2005, is even larger than Pluto.

Pluto was different in other ways. The outer planets are all gas giants.
Pluto is small, icy, and rocky. Pluto has a diameter of about 2,400 km.
It has only about one-fifth the mass of Earth’s Moon. Pluto’s orbit is
tilted relative to the other planets. It's orbit is shaped like a long,
narrow ellipse. Pluto’s orbit sometimes even passes inside Neptune’s
orbit.

Pluto’s orbit is in the Kuiper belt. With more than 200 million Kuiper
belt objects, Pluto has failed the test of clearing other bodies out of
its orbit.

From what you’ve read above, do you think Pluto should be called a
planet? Why are people hesitant to take away Pluto’s planetary status?
Is Pluto a dwarf planet?

A video showing why Pluto isn’t a planet any more:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqX2YdnwtRc](watch?v=FqX2YdnwtRc) .

Pluto has three moons of its own. The largest, Charon, is big compared
to Pluto. The Pluto-Charon system is sometimes called a double dwarf
planet ( **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjUtNTMtUGx1dG8tYW5kLWl0cy1tb29u) ). Two
smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, were discovered in 2005.

Pluto and the other dwarf planets, besides Ceres, are found orbiting out
beyond Neptune.

#### Ceres {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2VyZXM._18-ech}

Ceres ( **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMzYtQ2VyZXM.) )
is a rocky body that orbits the Sun. It could be an asteroid or a
planet. Before 2006, Ceres was thought to be the largest asteroid. Is it
an asteroid? Ceres is in the asteroid belt. But it is by far the largest
object in the belt. Ceres has such high gravity that it is spherical.

Is Ceres a planet? Ceres only has about 1.3% of the mass of the Earth’s
Moon. Its orbit is full of other smaller bodies. Its gravity was not
high enough to clear its orbit. Ceres fails the fourth criterion for
being a planet. Ceres is now considered a dwarf planet, the closest to
the Sun.

#### Haumea {#14.html#x-ck12-SGF1bWVh_18-ljv}

Haumea was named a dwarf planet in 2008. It is an unusual dwarf planet.
The body is shaped like an oval! Haumea's longest axis is about the same
as Pluto's diameter. Its shortest axis is about half as long. The body's
orbit is tilted 28 degrees. Haumea is so far from the Sun that it takes
283 years to make one orbit ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMzgtaGF1bWVh) ).

**Figure 14.42**

An artist’s drawing of what Haumea and its moons might look like. The
moons are drawn closer to Haumea than their actual orbits.

</div>

Haumea is the third-brightest Kuiper belt object. Haumea has two moons.
Haumea's odd oval shape is probably caused by its extremely rapid
rotation. It rotates in just less than 4 hours! Like other Kuiper belt
objects, Haumea is covered by ice. Its density is similar to Earth’s
Moon, at 2.6 – 3.3 g/cm ^3^ . This means that most of Haumea is rocky.

Haumea is part of a collisional family. This is a group of astronomical
objects that formed from an impact. This family has Haumea, its two
moons, and five more objects. All of these objects are thought to have
formed from a collision very early in the formation of the solar system.

#### Makemake {#14.html#x-ck12-TWFrZW1ha2U._18-pqh}

Makemake is the third-largest and second-brightest dwarf planet we have
discovered so far ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtMzktbWFrZW1ha2U.) ). Makemake is
only 75 percent the size of Pluto. Its diameter is between 1300 and 1900
kilometers. The name comes from the mythology of the Eastern Islanders.
Makemake was the god that created humanity. At a distance between 38.5
to 53 AU, this dwarf planet orbits the Sun in 310 years. Makemake is
made of methane, ethane, and nitrogen ices.

**Figure 14.44**

Eris is the largest known dwarf planet, but it's so far from the Sun
that it wasn't discovered until 2005.

</div>

Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. It is 27
percent larger than Pluto ( **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjUtNDAtZXJpcw..) ). Like Pluto and
Makemake, Eris is in the Kuiper belt. But Eris is about three times
farther from the Sun than Pluto. Because of its distance, Eris was not
discovered until 2005. Early on, it was thought that Eris might be the
tenth planet. Its discovery helped astronomers realize that they needed
a new definition of “planet.” Eris has a small moon that orbits Eris
once about every 16 days.

Astronomers know there may be other dwarf planets far out in the solar
system. Look for Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus to possibly be added to the
list of dwarf planets in the future. We still have a lot to discover and
explore!

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-zge}

-   There are currently five dwarf planets in our solar system: Pluto,
    Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres.
-   Most dwarf planets are similar to planets, except that they haven't
    cleared their space of debris.
-   Pluto was thought to be larger than it is because its large moon
    made the dwarf planet look bigger than it is.

## Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-rsd}

At the center of the solar system is our star, the Sun. The Sun gets its
power from the fusion of hydrogen and helium. The Sun has no solid
parts, but it has layers. Much of what the Sun is made of is plasma. The
Sun's surface features, like sunspots, can affect Earth. Eight planets
orbit the Sun. The four nearest the Sun are small, dense, and rocky. The
four farthest from the Sun are large and gaseous. Mercury is the
smallest planet. It is closest to the Sun so it is extremely hot. Venus
has a thick, atmosphere with a lot of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide
gives the planet a large greenhouse effect so it is very hot. Earth, the
third rock from the Sun, is the only one of the inner planets with a
large moon. The Moon is the only body in the Universe, besides Earth,
where humans have walked. The red planet, Mars, is the most Earth-like.
The planet has volcanoes, channels where water once flowed and an
enormous canyon. The four gas planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune. They are made of hydrogen, helium, and some methane and other
gases. All have rings and moons. The solar system also includes at least
five dwarf planets. After decades as a planet, Pluto was recently made a
dwarf planet. There are also asteroids, and comets. An object that
strikes Earth is a meteorite. Increasing numbers of planets are now
being found in other solar systems.

**To infinity and beyond!**

The same tools that are used to study the solar system can be used to
study the great beyond. Tools like the Hubble Space Telescope show
astronomers the most amazing things. Even one century ago, no one knew
that there was anything out there beyond our galaxy. Now we can see
fantastic images of other galaxies. And supernovae and stars and even
evidence of black holes. In this concept, we will explore a tiny bit of
what is out there... beyond our solar system... even beyond our galaxy!
This Hubble Space Telescope image is of one of the Universe's most
photogenic galaxies, Messier 104.

**Is this pattern of stars meaningful?**

This is a constellation, a pattern of stars in the night sky. This
constellation is called Orion. The features you can see best are his
belt and sword. You can see Orion's belt in the sky from many locations.
These stars are very bright. For many constellations, the stars are not
near each other. They just happen to appear near each other in our sky.

### Stars {#15.html#x-ck12-U3RhcnM.-puc}

When you look at the sky on a clear night, you can see hundreds of
stars. A **star** is a giant ball of glowing gas that is very, very hot.
A star generates energy by nuclear fusion reactions. Most of these stars
are like our Sun. However, some stars are smaller than our Sun, and some
are larger. Except for our own Sun, all stars are so far away that they
only look like single points—even through a telescope.

### Constellations {#15.html#x-ck12-Q29uc3RlbGxhdGlvbnM.-rtc}

The stars that make up a **constellation** appear close to each other
from Earth. In reality, they may be very distant from one another.
Constellations were important to people, like the Ancient Greeks. People
who spent a lot of time outdoors at night, like shepherds, named the
constellations. They told stories about them. Pictured below is one of
the most easily recognized constellations ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1PcmlvblN0YXJDaGFydA..) ). The ancient
Greeks thought this group of stars looked like a hunter. They named it
Orion, after a great hunter in Greek mythology.

![Star map of the stars in the constellation
orion](ck12_15_files/20150911030123311670.png "Star map of the stars in the constellation orion")

**Figure 15.1**

Orion has three stars that make up his belt. Orion's belt is fairly easy
to see in the night sky.

</div>

The constellations stay the same night after night. The patterns of the
stars never change. However, each night the constellations move across
the sky. They move because Earth is spinning on its axis. The
constellations also move with the seasons. This is because Earth
revolves around the Sun. The constellations in the winter are different
from those in the summer. For example, Orion is high up in the winter
sky. In the summer, it's only up in the early morning.

Constellations are useful. They help astronomers and other observers
orient in the night sky. The star Betelgeuse, for example, is Orion's
right shoulder. Betelgeuse is the eighth brightest star in the sky. The
star is an excellent example of a red supergiant.

### Apparent Versus Real Distances {#15.html#x-ck12-QXBwYXJlbnQgVmVyc3VzIFJlYWwgRGlzdGFuY2Vz-cju}

The stars in a constellation appear close together in our night sky. But
they are not at all close together out in space. In the constellation
Orion, the stars visible to the naked eye are at distances ranging from
just 26 light-years (which is relatively close to Earth) to several
thousand light-years away.

### What is Astrology? {#15.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBBc3Ryb2xvZ3k_-rdf}

Ancient Babylonian astronomers created the Zodiac. The Zodiac is a
circle that divides the ecliptic into twelve 30-degree zones. Each zone
contains a constellation, many of them animals. Horoscopes based on
these astrological signs first appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt in around 50
BC. These early people used astrology to explain things that are now
much better explained by science. You can see an example of a Zodiac
below ( **Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1CZWl0LUFscGhh) ).

**Figure 15.2**

How did astrology come to be?

</div>

There is no reason to think that the alignment of the stars has anything
to do with events that happen on Earth. The constellations are patterns
made from stars in the sky. The patterns do not reflect any
characteristics of the stars themselves. When scientific tests are done
to provide evidence in support of astrological ideas, the tests fail.
When a scientific idea fails, it is abandoned or modified. Astrologers
do not change or abandon their ideas when they fail. So astrology is not
science.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-q2a}

-   The points of light in the night sky are stars that are balls
    of gas. They are lit by nuclear fusion.
-   Constellations are patterns of stars seen from Earth. These stars
    are usually not near each other.
-   Stars in a constellation may be fairly close together. More likely,
    though, they are extremely far apart.

**Did you know that the night sky is so bright?**

Starlight can be surprisingly bright in the night sky. Of course,
daytime is all about starlight. The star is our Sun, and it shines so
brightly because it is so close to us. Even the Moon is bright because
of light from the Sun. Some stars produce much more energy than the Sun.
They're just farther away, so the light is not as obvious. How do stars
generate so much energy?

### Nuclear Fusion {#15.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVhciBGdXNpb24._1-ty4}

Stars shine because of **nuclear fusion** . Fusion reactions in the
Sun's core keep our nearest star burning. Stars are made mostly of
hydrogen and helium. Both are very light gases, but a star contains so
much hydrogen and helium that its total mass is enormous. The pressure
at the center of a star is great enough to heat the gases. This causes
nuclear fusion reactions.

A nuclear fusion reaction is so named because the nuclei (center) of
atoms fuse (join) together in the process. In stars like our Sun,
hydrogen atoms join together to create a helium atom. Nuclear fusion
reactions need a lot of energy to get started. Once they begin, they
produce even more energy. ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMDItVGhlcm1vbnVjbGVhci1ib21i) ).

### Particle Accelerators {#15.html#x-ck12-UGFydGljbGUgQWNjZWxlcmF0b3Jz_1-pbv}

Scientists have built machines called **particle accelerators** . These
amazing tools smash particles that are smaller than atoms into each
other head-on. This creates new particles. Scientists use particle
accelerators to learn about nuclear fusion in stars. They can also learn
about how atoms came together in the first few minutes of the Universe.
Two well-known accelerators are SLAC, in California, and CERN, in
Switzerland ( **Figure**

**Why are the stars in the Orion constellation different colors?**

In this view of Orion you can see that the stars are different colors.
The red star in the upper left is Betelgeuse (pronounced BET-ul-juice).
The blue star in the lower right is Rigel. The fuzzy patch in the sword
is the Orion nebula. The nebula will be discussed in the concept "Star
Formation."

### Star Classification {#15.html#x-ck12-U3RhciBDbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg.._2-7rl}

With a quick look, stars look the same. Look closer, though, and you can
see differences. The most obvious differences are in size and color.

#### Color and Temperature {#15.html#x-ck12-Q29sb3IgYW5kIFRlbXBlcmF0dXJl_2-2d5}

Think about the coil of an electric stove as it heats up. The coil
changes in color as its temperature rises. When you first turn on the
heat, the coil looks black. The air a few inches above the coil begins
to feel warm. As the coil gets hotter, it starts to glow a dull red. As
it gets even hotter, it becomes a brighter red. Next it turns orange. If
it gets extremely hot, it might look yellow-white, or even blue-white.
Like a coil on a stove, a star’s color is determined by the temperature
of the star’s surface. Relatively cool stars are red. Warmer stars are
orange or yellow. Extremely hot stars are blue or blue-white.

Star temperatures are measured in degrees kelvin. The lowest temperature
on the kelvin scale is absolute zero. That means molecules have no
motion. Kelvin is related to Celsius and Fahrenheit in these ways:

\[°C\] = \[K\] − 273.15

\[°F\] = \[K\] × 9/5 − 459.67

#### Classification {#15.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._2-qtw}

A graph of the brightness (absolute magnitude) of stars versus their
color (temperature) is pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1IUkRpYWdyYW0y) ). This is called
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

Most stars fall along the main sequence curve. Stars in the main
sequence fuse hydrogen into helium in the core. The horizontal branch
also has many stars. These fuse helium in the core and burn hydrogen
surrounding the core. Other stars are found in other regions.

This illustration ( **Figure**

the relative sizes of stars and their mass compared to the Sun. **Red
dwarfs** are less massive and much smaller in size than the Sun. This
means they have a very long lifetime. Our Sun is a fairly common type of
star and has an average lifespan. **Red giants** are what some main
sequence stars (like our Sun) become near the end of their lives. They
are much larger than our Sun. **Supergiants** are very massive stars and
are larger than our Sun, but have a smaller radius than red giants.
Supergiants have very short lifetimes.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-t12}

-   Stars are classified by color, which correlates with temperature.
    Red stars are the coolest and blue are the hottest.
-   Stars are plotted on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
-   Star temperatures are found in a continuum ranging from 2000 K to
    more than 30,000 K.
-   Kelvin is a temperature measure in which the lowest temperature is
    absolute zero.

**Can you see stars being born?**

On a dark night you can practically watch stars being born. The fuzzy
area in the sword in the constellation Orion is the Orion nebula. A
close up shows the nebula with around 3,000 stars. New stars are being
born there.

### Star Lives {#15.html#x-ck12-U3RhciBMaXZlcw.._3-qnz}

Stars have a life cycle, just like people. Stars are born, grow, change
over time, and eventually grow old and die. Most stars change in size,
color, and class at least once in their lifetime. What astronomers know
about the life cycles of stars comes from data gathered from visual,
radio, and X-ray telescopes.

#### Nebulae {#15.html#x-ck12-TmVidWxhZQ.._3-8zl}

Stars are born in a cloud of gas and dust called a **nebula** (
**Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Sb3NldHRlTmVidWxh) ). Our
Sun and solar system formed out of a nebula.

#### Star Formation {#15.html#x-ck12-U3RhciBGb3JtYXRpb24._3-1mj}

For a star to form, gravity pulls gas and dust into the center of the
nebula. As the material becomes denser, the pressure and the temperature
increase. When the temperature of the center becomes hot enough, nuclear
fusion begins. The ball of gas has become a star!

Our Sun was probably born in a nebula, like Orion in the top image.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-pf4}

-   Stars form in a nebula.
-   A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas.

**What do most stars look like?**

We have a main sequence star nearby. Our Sun is on the main sequence,
classified as a yellow dwarf. Our Sun has been a main sequence star for
about 5 billion years. As a medium-sized star, it will continue to shine
for about 5 billion more years. Most stars are on the main sequence.

### Main Sequence Stars {#15.html#x-ck12-TWFpbiBTZXF1ZW5jZSBTdGFycw.._4-fvc}

For most of a star’s life, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium atoms. A
star like this is a **main sequence star** . The hotter a main sequence
star is, the brighter it is. A star remains on the main sequence as long
as it is fusing hydrogen to form helium.

#### Classifying Stars by Color {#15.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZnlpbmcgU3RhcnMgYnkgQ29sb3I._4-jkg}

The most common way of classifying main sequence stars is by color (
**Table**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb25fU3RhcnNfQ29sb3JfVGVtcGVyYXR1cmU.)
). Each class of star is given a letter, a color, and a range of
temperatures. The letters don’t match the color names because stars were
first grouped as A through O. It wasn't until later that their order was
corrected to go by increasing temperature. When you try to remember the
order, you can use this phrase: “Oh Be A Fine Good Kid, Man.”

<div
id="15.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb25fU3RhcnNfQ29sb3JfVGVtcGVyYXR1cmU.">

[![](images/table.png)](table_15-1.html)

**Click on the image above to view the table**

</div>

The surface temperature of most stars is due to their size. Bigger stars
produce more energy, so their surfaces are hotter. But some very small
stars are very hot. Some very big stars are cool.

Large stars burn through their supply of hydrogen very quickly. These
stars “live fast and die young!” A very large star may only be on the
main sequence for 10 million years. A very small star could remain on
the main sequence for tens to hundreds of billions of years—far longer
than the current age of our Universe.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-nq6}

-   Stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence. These stars
    fuse hydrogen into helium for energy.
-   Large main sequence stars may be hotter than small stars—but
    not always.
-   Large stars are not on the main sequence as long as small stars.

**What's next for the Sun?**

What happens after our Sun comes off the main sequence? Our Sun will
become an enormous red star. It will grow so large that it will be out
past Mars to the edge of the asteroid belt. Obviously, it will engulf
our Earth. Betelgeuse is a red giant star that you can see in the sky
near Orion.

### Red Giants {#15.html#x-ck12-UmVkIEdpYW50cw.._5-h3d}

Eventually a main sequence star will use up all of its hydrogen. It then
starts to fuse helium atoms into larger elements like carbon. At this
time, the star’s core will collapse inward. The star's outer layers will
spread out and cool. The result is a larger star that is cooler on the
surface, and red in color. The star is now a **red giant** .

### White Dwarfs {#15.html#x-ck12-V2hpdGUgRHdhcmZz_5-6xa}

Eventually a red giant burns up all of the helium in its core. What
happens next depends on the star's mass. A star like the Sun stops
fusion and shrinks into a white dwarf star. A **white dwarf** is a hot,
white, glowing object about the size of Earth. Eventually, a white dwarf
cools down, and its light fades out.

Sirius ( **Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMDktc2lyaXVz) )
is seen as the brightest star in the sky. It is actually a binary star
system. Sirius A is on the main sequence. Sirius B is a tiny white

-   In a red giant, the inner helium core contracts while the outer
    layers of hydrogen expand.
-   When the helium is gone, the stars become white dwarfs.

**What if the sun were larger?**

A larger star has a different fate. It will not just eventually fade
away. A large star will explode. These explosions are very important for
all of us. We could not exist without them. To see the results of
supernova explosions, you need only look at yourself.

### Supergiants {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJnaWFudHM._6-yjx}

A more massive star ends its life in a more dramatic way. Very massive
stars become red **supergiants** . Unlike a red giant, when all the
helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse
into heavier atoms up to iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than iron
through fusion uses more energy than it produces. For this reason, stars
do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more
elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and
collapses.

Betelgeuse ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMDktT3Jpb24.) ) is a red supergiant.
VY Canis Majoris, the largest known star, is even larger. It is
classified as a red hypergiant.

**Figure 15.10**

The red star Betelgeuse in Orion is a red supergiant.

</div>

In a red supergiant, fusion does not stop. Lighter atoms fuse into
heavier atoms. Eventually iron atoms form.

### Supernova {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXJub3Zh_6-ogy}

When there is nothing left to fuse, the star’s iron core explodes
violently. This is called a **supernova** explosion. The incredible
energy released fuses heavy atoms together. The elements heavier than
iron form in supernova explosions, including gold, silver, and uranium.
A supernova can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy, but only for a
short time, as illustrated below ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMTEtU3VwZXJub3Zhcw..) ).

#### The Importance of Supernovae {#15.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEltcG9ydGFuY2Ugb2YgU3VwZXJub3ZhZQ.._6-yjd}

All chemical elements except hydrogen, helium, and lithium were created
in stars. These chemical elements are found in our solar system and on
Earth because of supernova explosions. This is what people mean when
they say that we are all made of stardust.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-jlk}

-   When a massive star has no more elements left to fuse, it explodes
    as a supernova.
-   Chemical elements heavier than lithium form in a supernova.
-   A supernova explosion spreads the elements into nearby space. This
    is the source of most of our elements.

**How dense can you get?**

A neutron star has about 500,000 times Earth's mass. It is the size of
Brooklyn, New York. These objects have an immense amount of gravity, but
not as much as a black hole!

### Neutron Stars {#15.html#x-ck12-TmV1dHJvbiBTdGFycw.._7-3ma}

After a supernova explosion, the star's core is left over. This material
is extremely dense. What happens next depends on the core's mass. The
core might be less than about four times the mass of the sun. In this
case, the star will become a neutron star. A **neutron star** (
**Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjYtMDUtbmV1dHJvbi1zdGFy) )
is made almost entirely of neutrons. A neutron star has more mass than
the sun; yet, it is only a few kilometers in diameter.

### Black Holes {#15.html#x-ck12-QmxhY2sgSG9sZXM._7-p7g}

The core remaining after a supernova could be more than about five times
the mass of the sun. In this case, the core collapses to become a
**black hole** . Black holes are unimaginably dense. Not even light can
escape their gravity ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1HcmF2aXRhdGlvbmFsTGVuc2luZw..) )!
This is why they are black. We can't see black holes.

How can we know something exists if radiation can't escape it? A black
hole affects the objects around it. It affects them with its gravity.
Some radiation may leak out around the edges of a black hole. A black
hole isn't a hole at all. It is the tremendously dense core of a
supermassive star.

**Can you see a star cluster in the night sky?**

The Pleiades are also called the seven sisters. Seven of the stars in
this cluster are visible in the night sky with the naked eye. The
Pleiades are easy to spot. They are bright and very close to each other.

### Star Systems {#15.html#x-ck12-U3RhciBTeXN0ZW1z_8-q62}

Our solar system has only one star. But many stars are in **star
systems** of two or more stars. Two stars that orbit each other are
called a binary star system. If more than two stars orbit each other, it
is called a multiple star system. Pictured below are two binary star
systems orbiting each other ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjYtMDYtSEQtOTg4MDA.) ). This creates an
unusual quadruple star system. The distance separating the two pairs is
about the same as the distance from our Sun to Pluto.

### Star Clusters {#15.html#x-ck12-U3RhciBDbHVzdGVycw.._8-j1a}

**Star clusters** are small groups of stars. A star cluster is smaller
than a galaxy. There are two main types, open clusters and globular
clusters. Both types are held together by gravity.

##### Open Clusters {#15.html#x-ck12-T3BlbiBDbHVzdGVycw.._8-34j}

**Open clusters** are groups of up to a few thousand stars. The Jewel
Box ( **Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjYtMDctSmV3ZWwtQm94)
), is an open cluster. Open clusters tend to be blue in color. They
often contain glowing gas and dust. The stars in an open cluster are
young stars that all formed from the same nebula.

**Globular clusters** ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjYtMDgtZ2xvYnVsYXItY2x1c3Rlcg..) ) are
groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars. Gravity holds these
stars tightly together. Globular clusters have a definite, spherical
shape. They contain mostly old, reddish stars. Near the center of a
globular cluster, the stars are closer together. The heart of the
globular cluster M13 has hundreds of thousands of stars. M13 is 145
light years in diameter. The cluster contains red and blue giant stars.

**What's happening with those galaxies?**

Find a clear night sky and get out a good pair of binoculars or a
telescope. You can see this feature (although not quite as well). The
Whirlpool galaxy has an enhanced spiral structure due to its
interactions with its companion galaxy, NGC 5195.

### Galaxies {#15.html#x-ck12-R2FsYXhpZXM._9-t4f}

Compared to Earth, the solar system is a big place. Compared to the
solar system a star cluster is a big place. But galaxies are bigger—a
lot bigger.

A **galaxy** is a very large group of stars held together by gravity.
How enormous a galaxy is and how many stars it contains is impossible
for us to really understand. A galaxy contains up to a few billion
stars! Our solar system is in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is so large that
if our solar system were the size of your fist, the galaxy’s disk would
be wider than the entire United States! There are several different
types of galaxies, and there are billions of galaxies in the Universe.

#### Types of Galaxies {#15.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgR2FsYXhpZXM._9-x31}

Galaxies are divided into three types, according to shape. There are
spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies.

#### Spiral Galaxies {#15.html#x-ck12-U3BpcmFsIEdhbGF4aWVz_9-spd}

A **spiral galaxy** is a rotating disk of stars and dust. In the center
is a dense bulge of material. Several **spiral arms** come out from the
center. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and many young stars.
The image below ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-TVMtRVMtMjYtMTAtc3BpcmFsLWdhbGF4eQ..) ) shows a
spiral galaxy from the side. You can see the disk and central bulge.

guessed, elliptical galaxies are elliptical, or egg-shaped. The smallest
elliptical galaxies are as small as some globular clusters. Giant
elliptical galaxies can contain over a trillion stars. Elliptical
galaxies are reddish to yellowish in color because they contain mostly
old stars.

#### Irregular Galaxies and Dwarf Galaxies {#15.html#x-ck12-SXJyZWd1bGFyIEdhbGF4aWVzIGFuZCBEd2FyZiBHYWxheGllcw.._9-njq}

Look at the galaxy pictured below ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTI2MDItMDk.) ). Do you think this is a
spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy? It is neither one! Galaxies that
are not clearly elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are called
**irregular galaxies** . Most irregular galaxies were once spiral or
elliptical galaxies. They were then deformed either by gravitational
attraction to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy.

This galaxy, called NGC 1427A, is an irregular galaxy. It has neither a
spiral nor an elliptical shape.

</div>

**Dwarf galaxies** are small galaxies containing “only” a few million to
a few billion stars. Most dwarf galaxies are irregular in shape.
However, there are also *dwarf elliptical galaxies* and *dwarf spiral
galaxies* . Dwarf galaxies are the most common type in the Universe.
However, because they are relatively small and dim, we don’t see as many
dwarf galaxies as we do their full-sized cousins.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-cqn}

-   A galaxy is composed of millions to billions of stars.
-   Galaxies can be spiral, elliptical, or irregular.

**Have you seen the Milky Way?**

There is so much light pollution in most cities that many people have
never seen the Milky Way. On a clear night away from lights, the view is
of a bright white river of stars. You don't need a telescope or even
binoculars to see it. The view of the Milky Way is so bright because
you're looking at the stars in your own galaxy.

### The Milky Way Galaxy {#15.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1pbGt5IFdheSBHYWxheHk._10-cvr}

The **Milky Way Galaxy** is our galaxy. Home, sweet home. The Milky Way
is made of millions of stars along with a lot of gas and dust. It looks
different from other galaxies because we are looking at the main disk
from within the galaxy. Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way contains
200 billion to 400 billion stars.

#### Shape and Size {#15.html#x-ck12-U2hhcGUgYW5kIFNpemU._10-vqp}

It is difficult to know what the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy is
because we are inside of it. Astronomers have identified it as a typical
spiral galaxy containing about 100 billion to 400 billion stars (
**Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTI2MDItMTE.) ).

Like other spiral galaxies, our galaxy has a disk, a central bulge, and
spiral arms. The disk is about 100,000 light-years across and 3,000
light-years thick. Most of the Galaxy’s gas, dust, young stars, and open
clusters are in the disk.

The Milky Way Galaxy is a big place. If our solar system were the size
of your fist, the Galaxy’s disk would still be wider than the entire
United States!

.

#### Where We Are {#15.html#x-ck12-V2hlcmUgV2UgQXJl_10-smf}

Our solar system, including the Sun, Earth, and all the other planets,
is within one of the spiral arms in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy.
Most of the stars we see in the sky are also in this spiral arm. We are
about 26,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy. We are a little
more than halfway out from the center of the galaxy to the edge.

Just as Earth orbits the Sun, the solar system orbits the center of the
galaxy. Astronomers have recently discovered that at the center of the
Milky Way and most other galaxies, is a supermassive black hole.

This video describes the solar system in which we live. It is located in
an outer edge of the Milky Way galaxy, which spans 100,000 light years:

**What's at the edge of the Universe?**

This image is of the farthest away objects in the Universe. It was taken
by the Hubble Space Telescope. The image looks back about 13 billion
years. The galaxies in this image were all very young. It has just taken
13 billion years for their light to reach us.

### The Universe {#15.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFVuaXZlcnNl_11-kvr}

The study of the Universe is called **cosmology** . Cosmologists study
the structure and changes in the present Universe. The **Universe**
contains all of the star systems, galaxies, gas, and dust, plus all the
matter and energy that exists now. Plus all that existed in the past,
and all that will exist in the future. The Universe includes all of
space and time.

### Human Understanding of the Universe {#15.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gVW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZyBvZiB0aGUgVW5pdmVyc2U._11-sdk}

What did the ancient Greeks recognize as the Universe? Their Universe
had Earth at the center, the Sun, the Moon, five planets, and a sphere
to which all the stars were attached. This idea held for many centuries.
Galileo and his telescope helped people recognize that Earth is not the
center of the Universe. They also found out that there are many more
stars than were visible to the naked eye. All of those stars were in the
Milky Way Galaxy.

In the early 20th century, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMjQtSHViYmxlcy10ZWxlc2NvcGU.) )
discovered something amazing. He showed that the Andromeda Nebula was
over 2 million light years away. This was many times farther than the
farthest distances that had ever been measured. Hubble realized that
many of the objects that astronomers called nebulas were not actually
clouds of gas. They were collections of millions or billions of stars.
We now call these features galaxies.

Hubble showed that the Universe was much larger than our own galaxy.
Today, we know that the Universe contains about a hundred billion
galaxies. This is about the same number of galaxies as there are stars
in the Milky Way Galaxy.

**Why does a siren change pitch as it passes you?**

The sound of a siren on an emergency vehicle changes as it passes you.
It shifts from higher to lower pitch. As the vehicle moves toward you,
the sound waves are pushed together. As the vehicle moves past you, the
waves are spread apart. This effect with light tells astronomers
something about our Universe.

### The Universe is Expanding {#15.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFVuaXZlcnNlIGlzIEV4cGFuZGluZw.._12-iyc}

After discovering that there are galaxies outside our own, Edwin Hubble
went on to measure the distance to hundreds of other galaxies. His data
would eventually show us how the Universe is changing, and even give us
clues as to how the Universe formed.

#### Redshift {#15.html#x-ck12-UmVkc2hpZnQ._12-khc}

If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a **spectrum** . The
spectrum is the range of colors seen in a rainbow. The spectrum has
specific dark bands where elements in the star have absorbed light of
certain energies. An astronomer can use these lines to determine which
elements are in a distant star. In fact, the element helium was first
discovered in our Sun, not on Earth. This was done by analyzing the
absorption lines in the spectrum of the sun.

Astronomers studied the spectra of light from distant galaxies. When
they did this they noticed something strange. The dark lines in the
spectrum were in the patterns they expected. But they were shifted
toward the red end of the spectrum ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1NUy1FUy1Eb3BwbGVyRWZmZWN0) ). This shift of
absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as
**redshift** .

earth](ck12_15_files/20150911030128719585.png "Stars are redshifted because they are moving away from the earth")

**Figure 15.24**

Redshift is a shift in absorption bands toward the red end of the
spectrum. Redshift occurs when the light source is moving away from you
or when the space between you and the source is stretched.

</div>

Redshift occurs when the source of light is moving away from the
observer. So when astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy,
they know that the galaxy is moving away from Earth. The strange part is
that almost every galaxy in the Universe has a redshift. Of course, this
means that almost every galaxy is moving away from us.

#### The Expanding Universe {#15.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEV4cGFuZGluZyBVbml2ZXJzZQ.._12-xgo}

Edwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to galaxies with
other astronomers’ measurements of redshift. He noticed a relationship,
which is now called *Hubble’s Law:* The farther away a galaxy is, the
faster it is moving away from us. In other words, the Universe is
expanding!

Pictured below is a simplified diagram of the expansion of the Universe
( **Figure** [below](#15.html#x-ck12-RWFyU2NpLTI2MDMtMDM.) ). Another
way to picture this is to imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. Each
dot represents a galaxy. When you inflate the balloon, the dots slowly
move away from each other because the rubber stretches in the space
between them. If it were a giant balloon and you were standing on one of
the dots, you would see the other dots moving away from you. Not only
that, but dots farther away from you on the balloon would move away
faster than dots nearby.

**Figure 15.25**

This is a simplified diagram of the expansion of the Universe over time.
Note that the distance between galaxies gets bigger as you go forward in
time, but the size of each galaxy stays about the same.

</div>

An inflating balloon is not exactly like the expanding Universe. The
surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three
dimensions. But it is true that space itself is stretching out between
galaxies like the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated. This
stretching of space, which causes the distance between galaxies to
increase, is what astronomers mean by the expansion of the Universe.

One other difference between the Universe and our balloon model involves
the actual size of the galaxies. On the inflating balloon, the dots you
made will become larger in size as you inflate it. In our Universe,
however, the galaxies stay the same size; it is just the space between
the galaxies that increases as the Universe expands.

An animation of an expanding Universe is shown here:

.

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-lzk}

-   Almost every galaxy is moving away from us.
-   The spectrum from stars is shifted toward the red; this is known
    as red-shift. Red-shift of galaxies is evidence that the Universe
    is expanding.
-   Hubble's Law states that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it
    is moving away from us.

**How did everything begin in the Big Bang?**

The time when the Universe began is the explosion known as the Big Bang.
Everything in the Universe was part of that explosion, although not in
its current form.

**Figure 15.26**

Timeline of the Big Bang and the expansion of the Universe.

</div>

There is a great deal of evidence that the Universe started with a big
bang. The **Big Bang theory** is the most widely accepted cosmological
explanation of how the Universe formed. Think about the expanding
Universe, then reverse it. If we start at the present and go back into
the past, the Universe gets smaller. What is the end result of a
contracting Universe? A point.

According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe began about 13.7 billion
years ago. Everything that is now in the Universe was squeezed into a
point. It was all in a single, hot, chaotic mass. Then an enormous
explosion—a big bang—took place. The big bang caused the Universe to
start expanding rapidly. All the matter and energy, even space itself,
came out of this explosion ( **Figure**
[above](#15.html#x-ck12-Qy1FUy1CaWdCYW5n) ).

What came before the Big Bang? There is no way for scientists to know,
since there is no remaining evidence.

### After the Big Bang {#15.html#x-ck12-QWZ0ZXIgdGhlIEJpZyBCYW5n_13-pad}

In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the Universe was
unimaginably hot and dense. As the Universe expanded, it became less
dense. It began to cool. After only a few seconds, protons, neutrons,
and electrons could form. After a few minutes, hydrogen came together.
There was so much energy that nuclear fusion began. This created helium.

Clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually, these clumps
formed stars. There are now countless trillions of stars, billions of
galaxies, and other structures that form the visible Universe.

The galaxies at the edge of the Universe are a great distance away. But
they are something else that is distant. Because it takes so long for
light from so far away to reach us, they are also very far back in time
( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SHViYmxlX1VsdHJhX0RlZXBfZmllbGRfUHRE) ).

### Background Radiation {#15.html#x-ck12-QmFja2dyb3VuZCBSYWRpYXRpb24._13-ns3}

The Big Bang hypothesis was not immediately accepted. But an important
line of evidence for the Big Bang was discovered in 1964. In a static
Universe, the space between objects should have no heat at all. The
temperature should measure 0 K (Kelvin is an absolute temperature
scale). But two researchers at Bell Laboratories used a microwave
receiver to measure the background radiation in the Universe. They
discovered that it is not 0 K, but 3 K ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMzAtYmlnLWJhbmctdGhlb3J5) ). This
tiny amount of heat is left over from the Big Bang. Nearly all
astronomers and cosmologists now accept the Big Bang theory.

**Does science know everything?**

There are many things that science does not understand yet. There are
some things that science may never understand. Science deals with things
that are very far away. Or very old. Or that have left few traces of
their existence. Some of the most difficult topics to study are in
cosmology. The questions are age-old: What formed the Universe? What
will be the fate of the Universe? These are exciting questions to work
on! Dark matter and dark energy are two topics that are important to
them.

### Dark Matter {#15.html#x-ck12-RGFyayBNYXR0ZXI._14-xqg}

We see many objects out in space that emit light. We see other objects
that emit other types of electromagnetic radiation. The matter we can
see is contained in stars. The stars are contained in galaxies.
Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of
the matter in the Universe. The rest of the matter is called **dark
matter** .

#### Evidence for Dark Matter {#15.html#x-ck12-RXZpZGVuY2UgZm9yIERhcmsgTWF0dGVy_14-yv0}

Dark matter doesn’t emit light, so we can’t see it. We know it is there
because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example,
astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a
galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can
only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we
can see. The way light bends around a very distant supermassive object
is also due to dark matter ( **Figure**
[below](#15.html#x-ck12-SFMtRVMtMjYtMzEtR2FsYXhpZXM.) ).

**Figure 15.29**

The arc around the galaxies at the center of this image is caused by
gravitational lensing. The addition of gravitational pull from dark
matter is required to explain this phenomenon.

</div>

#### What is Dark Matter? {#15.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBpcyBEYXJrIE1hdHRlcj8._14-6av}

What is dark matter? Actually, we don’t really know. Dark matter could
just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The Universe could
contain lots of objects that don’t have enough mass to glow on their
own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is
that the Universe contains a lot of matter that is different from
anything we know. If it doesn’t interact much with ordinary matter, it
would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly.

Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination.
Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter
that we haven’t discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary
matter is less than half of the total matter in the Universe.

### Dark Energy {#15.html#x-ck12-RGFyayBFbmVyZ3k._14-bdk}

We know that the Universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it
is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the
Universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of
gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would
eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite
of the Big Bang.

Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered
that the Universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing
the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out
in the Universe that we can’t see. Astronomers call this **dark energy**
. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter.
Some scientists think that dark energy makes up more than half of the
Universe.

### KQED: Dark Energy {#15.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogRGFyayBFbmVyZ3k._14-uyx}

Meet one of the three winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics,
Lawrence Berkeley Lab astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter. He explains how
dark energy, which makes up 70 percent of the Universe, is causing our
Universe to expand. Learn more at:

### Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-h4q}

-   Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation. For this reason it
    cannot be sensed by astronomers.
-   Dark matter does have gravity. The effect of its gravity is seen on
    the motion of nearby objects.
-   Dark matter may be ordinary matter that is dark. It may be different
    from ordinary matter. It may be a combination of the two.
-   No one knows if dark energy exists. If it does, there may be a lot
    of it.

## Summary {#15.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-n9s}

Like humans, stars have a life cycle. Stars are born, go through middle
age and then end in some sort of death. Exactly what happens depends on
the size of the star. We can see different types of stars in the sky.
Some stars are brighter than others. Some are colored and some are
white. Stars are classified by their size and brightness. Stars cluster
in galaxies. There are some fantastic galaxies to see! We are located on
an arm of a spiral galaxy. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way. There are
many other galaxies of different types. Scientists use observations,
measurements, and mathematical calculations to hypothesize an origin for
the Universe. The theory that fits the data is called the Big Bang.
Scientists continue to learn new things about the Universe. For example,
dark matter and dark energy have only recently been discovered. In fact,
dark energy may not even exist!
