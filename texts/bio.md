# Forewor {#1.html#x-ck12-Rm9yZXdvcg..-chapter}

The study of biology is the study of life. The CK-12 Biology Concept
Collection presents biology as a set of 13 chapters, each centered
around a general area of study, such as cell biology or human biology.
Each chapter is broken down into concepts. Each concept is a mini-lesson
that addresses one specific topic or key objective. The complete CK-12
Biology Concept Collection is comprised of 328 concepts.

**Is there a way to define** ***life*** **?**

Scientifically, there is an actual definition of life. Living organisms
must have certain characteristics. If they do not have these
characteristics, are they living? This butterfly, like all other
insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common
characteristics with all life. What exactly does it mean to be *alive* ?
The *Introduction to Biology* chapter will answer this question. These
lessons will serve as an introduction to biology, discussing basic
*Fundamental Concepts of Science* and the *Chemistry of Life.*

**Chances are you've heard of the scientific method. But what exactly is
the scientific method?**

Is it a precise and exact way that all science must be done? Or is it a
series of steps that most scientists generally follow, but may be
modified for the benefit of an individual investigation?

### The Scientific Method {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNjaWVudGlmaWMgTWV0aG9k-2xn}

"We also discovered that science is cool and fun because you get to do
stuff that no one has ever done before." In the article *Blackawton
bees,* published by eight to ten year old students: Biology Letters
(2010)
[http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/12/18/rsbl.2010.1056.abstract](rsbl.2010.1056.abstract)
.

There are basic methods of gaining knowledge that are common to all of
science. At the heart of science is the scientific investigation, which
is done by following the **scientific method** . A **scientific
investigation** is a plan for asking questions and testing possible
answers. It generally follows the steps listed in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTAyLVNjaWVudGlmaWMtSW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi0x)
. See [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZaCy5Z87FA](watch?v=KZaCy5Z87FA)
for an overview of the scientific method.

Investigation](ck12_2_files/20150914103918686624.png "Steps of a Scientific Investigation")

**Figure 2.1**

Steps of a Scientific Investigation. A scientific investigation
typically has these steps. Scientists often develop their own steps they
follow in a scientific investigation. Shown here is a simplification of
how a scientific investigation is done.

</div>

#### Making Observations {#2.html#x-ck12-TWFraW5nIE9ic2VydmF0aW9ucw..-llx}

A scientific investigation typically begins with observations. You make
observations all the time. Let’s say you take a walk in the woods and
observe a moth, like the one in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QklPLTAxLTAzLU1vdGgtRXllLVNwb3Rz) , resting on a
tree trunk. You notice that the moth has spots on its wings that look
like eyes. You think the eye spots make the moth look like the face of
an owl.

Spots](ck12_2_files/20150914103918824066.jpeg "Moth Eye Spots")

**Figure 2.2**

Does this moth remind you of an owl?

</div>

#### Asking a Question {#2.html#x-ck12-QXNraW5nIGEgUXVlc3Rpb24.-gr9}

Observations often lead to questions. For example, you might ask
yourself why the moth has eye spots that make it look like an owl’s
face. What reason might there be for this observation?

#### Forming a Hypothesis {#2.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWluZyBhIEh5cG90aGVzaXM.-vst}

The next step in a scientific investigation is forming a hypothesis. A
**hypothesis** is a possible answer to a scientific question, but it
isn’t just any answer. A hypothesis must be based on scientific
knowledge, and it must be logical. A hypothesis also must be
falsifiable. In other words, it must be possible to make observations
that would disprove the hypothesis if it really is false. Assume you
know that some birds eat moths and that owls prey on other birds. From
this knowledge, you reason that eye spots scare away birds that might
eat the moth. This is your hypothesis.

#### Testing the Hypothesis {#2.html#x-ck12-VGVzdGluZyB0aGUgSHlwb3RoZXNpcw..-dp9}

To test a hypothesis, you first need to make a prediction based on the
hypothesis. A **prediction** is a statement that tells what will happen
under certain conditions. It can be expressed in the form: If A occurs,
then B will happen. Based on your hypothesis, you might make this
prediction: If a moth has eye spots on its wings, then birds will avoid
eating it.

Next, you must gather evidence to test your prediction. **Evidence** is
any type of data that may either agree or disagree with a prediction, so
it may either support or disprove a hypothesis. Evidence may be gathered
by an **experiment** . Assume that you gather evidence by making more
observations of moths with eye spots. Perhaps you observe that birds
really do avoid eating moths with eye spots. This evidence agrees with
your prediction.

#### Drawing Conclusions {#2.html#x-ck12-RHJhd2luZyBDb25jbHVzaW9ucw..-mak}

Evidence that agrees with your prediction supports your hypothesis. Does
such evidence prove that your hypothesis is true? No; a hypothesis
cannot be proven conclusively to be true. This is because you can never
examine all of the possible evidence, and someday evidence might be
found that disproves the hypothesis. Nonetheless, the more evidence that
supports a hypothesis, the more likely the hypothesis is to be true.

#### Communicating Results {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGluZyBSZXN1bHRz-oi6}

The last step in a scientific investigation is communicating what you
have learned with others. This is a very important step because it
allows others to test your hypothesis. If other researchers get the same
results as yours, they add support to the hypothesis. However, if they
get different results, they may disprove the hypothesis.

When scientists share their results, they should describe their methods
and point out any possible problems with the investigation. For example,
while you were observing moths, perhaps your presence scared birds away.
This introduces an error into your investigation. You got the results
you predicted (the birds avoided the moths while you were observing
them), but not for the reason you hypothesized. Other researchers might
be able to think of ways to avoid this error in future studies.

40 years. He is a leader in using satellite tags, time and depth
recorders and other sophisticated electronic tags to gather information
about the amazing depths to which elephant seals dive, their migration
routes and how they use oceanographic features to hunt for prey as far
as the international dateline and the Alaskan Aleutian Islands. In the

**So what exactly is an experiment?**

At first you may picture a science laboratory with microscopes and
chemicals and people in white lab coats. But do all experiments have to
be done in a lab? And do all scientists have to wear lab coats?

### Experiments {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhwZXJpbWVudHM._1-5ui}

**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTA0LVBsYW50LUV4cGVyaW1lbnQ.)
shows a laboratory experiment involving plants. An **experiment** is a
special type of scientific investigation that is performed under
controlled conditions, usually in a laboratory. Some experiments can be
very simple, but even the simplest can contribute important evidence
that helps scientists better understand the natural world. An example
experiment can be seen here
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVRBDRAsP6U](watch?v=dVRBDRAsP6U) or
here [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F10EyGwd57M](watch?v=F10EyGwd57M) .
As many different types of experiments are possible, an experiment must
be designed to produce data that can help confirm or reject the
hypothesis.

#### Medicine From the Ocean Floor {#2.html#x-ck12-TWVkaWNpbmUgRnJvbSB0aGUgT2NlYW4gRmxvb3I._1-qid}

Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz are looking to
perhaps the largest resource yet to be explored for its medical
potential: the ocean. And they are taping this resource with some
state-of-the-art technology. These scientists are using robots to sort
through thousands of marine chemicals in search of cures for diseases
like cholera, breast cancer, and malaria. These experiments are
described in the following KQED links:

#### Variables {#2.html#x-ck12-VmFyaWFibGVz_1-vsd}

An experiment generally tests how one **variable** is affected by
another. The affected variable is called the **dependent variable** . In
the plant experiment shown above, the dependent variable is plant
growth. The variable that affects the dependent variable is called the
**independent variable** . In the plant experiment, the independent
variable could be fertilizer—some plants will get fertilizer, others
will not. The scientists change the amount of the independent variable
(the fertilizer) to observe the effects on the dependent variable (plant
growth). An experiment needs to be run simultaneously in which no
fertilizer is given to the plant. This would be known as a **control
experiment. ** In any experiment, other factors that might affect the
dependent variable must be controlled. In the plant experiment, what
factors do you think should be controlled? ( *Hint:* What other factors
might affect plant growth?)

#### Sample Size and Repetition {#2.html#x-ck12-U2FtcGxlIFNpemUgYW5kIFJlcGV0aXRpb24._1-dhk}

The sample in an experiment or other investigation consists of the
individuals or events that are studied, and the size of the sample (or
**sample size** ) directly affects the interpretation of the results.
Typically, the sample is much smaller than all such individuals or
events that exist in the world. Whether the results based on the sample
are true in general cannot be known for certain. However, the larger the
sample is, the more likely it is that the results are generally true.

Similarly, the more times that an experiment is repeated (which is known
as **repetition** ) and the same results obtained, the more likely the
results are valid. This is why scientific experiments should always be
repeated.

#### Bio-Inspiration: Nature as Muse {#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLUluc3BpcmF0aW9uOiBOYXR1cmUgYXMgTXVzZQ.._1-jqj}

For hundreds of years, scientists have been using design ideas from
structures in nature. Now, biologists and engineers at the University of
California, Berkeley are working together to design a broad range of new
products, such as life-saving milli-robots modeled on the way
cockroaches run and adhesives based on the amazing design of a gecko's
foot. This process starts with making observations of nature, which lead
to asking questions and to the additional aspects of the scientific
process. *Bio-Inspiration: Nature as Muse* can be observed at

#### Super Microscopes {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VwZXIgTWljcm9zY29wZXM._1-h8e}

Microscopes are arguably one of the most important tools of the
biologist. They allow the visualization of smaller and smaller
biological organisms and molecules. With greatly magnified powers, these
instruments are becoming increasingly important in modern day research.
See the following KQED videos for additional information on these
remarkable tools.

**Theory vs. theory. Is a scientific** ***theory*** **different from the
everyday use of the word** ***theory?***

A scientific theory is accepted as a scientific *truth* , supported by
evidence collected by many scientists. The theory of evolution by
natural selection is a classic scientific theory.

### Scientific Theories {#2.html#x-ck12-U2NpZW50aWZpYyBUaGVvcmllcw.._2-hz4}

With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become scientific
theories. Keep in mind, a hypothesis is a possible answer to a
scientific question. A **scientific theory** is a broad explanation for
events that is widely accepted as true. To become a theory, a hypothesis
must be tested over and over again, and it must be supported by a great
deal of evidence.

People commonly use the word *theory* to describe a guess about how or
why something happens. For example, you might say, “I think a woodchuck
dug this hole in the ground, but it’s just a theory.” Using the word
*theory* in this way is different from the way it is used in science. A
scientific theory is more like a fact than a guess because it is so
well-supported. There are several well-known theories in biology,
including the theory of evolution, cell theory, and germ theory.

Two videos explaining scientific theories can be seen at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5YGhprR6KE](watch?v=S5YGhprR6KE) and

#### The Theory of Evolution {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRoZW9yeSBvZiBFdm9sdXRpb24._2-oya}

The theory of evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory.
**Evolution** is a change in the characteristics of living things over
time. Evolution occurs by a process called **natural selection** . In
natural selection, some living things produce more offspring than
others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do.
Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the
characteristics of living things. The theory of evolution by natural
selection explains how living things are changing today and how modern
living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer
exist on Earth. No evidence has been identified that proves this theory
is incorrect. More on the theory of evolution will be presented in
additional concepts.

#### The Cell Theory {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbGwgVGhlb3J5_2-r8o}

The cell theory is another important scientific theory of biology.
According to the **cell theory** , the cell is the smallest unit of
structure and function of all living organisms, all living organisms are
made up of at least one cell, and living cells always come from other
living cells. Once again, no evidence has been identified that proves
this theory is incorrect. More on the cell theory will be presented in
additional concepts.

#### The Germ Theory {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdlcm0gVGhlb3J5_2-zm1}

The **germ theory** of disease, also called the pathogenic theory of
medicine, is a scientific theory that proposes that microorganisms are
the cause of many diseases. Like the other scientific theories, lots of
evidence has been identified that supports this theory, and no evidence
has been identified that proves the theory is incorrect.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-mu1}

-   With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become
    scientific theories. A scientific theory is a broad explanation for
    events that is widely accepted as true.
-   Evolution is a change species over time. Evolution occurs by
    natural selection.
-   The cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells,
    and living cells always come from other living cells.
-   The germ theory proposes that microorganisms are the cause of
    many diseases.

**What do a bacterium and a whale have in common?**

Do they share characteristics with us? All living organisms, from the
smallest bacterium to the largest whale, share certain characteristics
of life. Without these characteristics, there is no *life.*

### Characteristics of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIExpZmU._3-a2t}

Look at the duck decoy in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTA2LUR1Y2stZGVjb3k.) . It looks very
similar to a real duck. Of course, real ducks are living things. What
about the decoy duck? It looks like a duck, but it is actually made of
wood. The decoy duck doesn’t have all the characteristics of a living
thing. What characteristics set the real ducks apart from the decoy
duck? What are the characteristics of living things?

characteristics of a living
thing](ck12_2_files/20150914103920050286.jpeg "A duck decoy looks like it's alive, but it doesn't have all the characteristics of a living thing")

**Figure 2.5**

This duck decoy looks like it’s alive. It even fools real ducks. Why
isn’t it a living thing?

</div>

To be classified as a living thing, an object must have all six of the
following characteristics:

1.  It responds to the environment.
2.  It grows and develops.
3.  It produces offspring.
4.  It maintains homeostasis.
5.  It has complex chemistry.
6.  It consists of cells.

#### Response to the Environment {#2.html#x-ck12-UmVzcG9uc2UgdG8gdGhlIEVudmlyb25tZW50_3-gw9}

All living things detect changes in their environment and respond to
them. What happens if you step on a rock? Nothing; the rock doesn’t
respond because it isn’t alive. But what if you think you are stepping
on a rock and actually step on a turtle shell? The turtle is likely to
respond by moving—it may even snap at you!

#### Growth and Development {#2.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBEZXZlbG9wbWVudA.._3-reh}

All living things grow and develop. For example, a plant seed may look
like a lifeless pebble, but under the right conditions it will grow and
develop into a plant. Animals also grow and develop. Look at the animals
in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTA3LUZyb2ctYW5kLVRhZHBvbGVz) . How will
the tadpoles change as they grow and develop into adult frogs?

**Figure 2.6**

Tadpoles go through many changes to become adult frogs.

</div>

#### Reproduction {#2.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_3-q7t}

All living things are capable of reproduction. **Reproduction** is the
process by which living things give rise to offspring. Reproducing may
be as simple as a single cell dividing to form two daughter cells.
Generally, however, it is much more complicated. Nonetheless, whether a
living thing is a huge whale or a microscopic bacterium, it is capable
of reproduction.

#### Keeping Things Constant {#2.html#x-ck12-S2VlcGluZyBUaGluZ3MgQ29uc3RhbnQ._3-ebf}

All living things are able to maintain a more-or-less constant internal
environment. They keep things relatively stable on the inside regardless
of the conditions around them. The process of maintaining a stable
internal environment is called **homeostasis** . Human beings, for
example, maintain a stable internal body temperature. If you go outside
when the air temperature is below freezing, your body doesn’t freeze.
Instead, by shivering and other means, it maintains a stable internal
temperature.

#### Complex Chemistry {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGxleCBDaGVtaXN0cnk._3-xao}

All living things—even the simplest life forms—have a complex chemistry.
Living things consist of large, complex molecules, and they also undergo
many complicated chemical changes to stay alive. Thousands (or more) of
these chemical reactions occur in each cell at any given moment.
**Metabolism** is the accumulated total of all the biochemical reactions
occurring in a cell or organism. Complex chemistry is needed to carry
out all the functions of life. 

#### Cells {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHM._3-vy2}

All forms of life are built of at least one cell. A **cell** is the
basic unit of the structure and function of living things. Living things
may appear very different from one another on the outside, but their
cells are very similar. Compare the human cells on the left in
**Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTA4LWh1bWFuLXZzLW9uaW9uLWNlbGxz) and
onion cells on the right in **Figure**

are they similar? If you click on the animation titled *Inside a Cell*
at the link below, you can look inside a cell and see its internal
structures.

**Reproduction, homeostasis, evolution, metabolism, heredity. What
controls characteristics of life?**

Characteristics of life are controlled by genes, which are passed from
parents to offspring, and are located on chromosomes, like the one shown
here, that are found in every cell. The gene theory is one of the
unifying principles of biology.

### Unifying Principles of Biology {#2.html#x-ck12-VW5pZnlpbmcgUHJpbmNpcGxlcyBvZiBCaW9sb2d5_4-ttg}

Four unifying principles form the basis of biology. Whether biologists
are interested in ancient life, the life of bacteria, or how humans
could live on the moon, they base their overall understanding of biology
on these four principles:

1.  cell theory
2.  gene theory
3.  homeostasis
4.  evolution

#### The Cell Theory {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbGwgVGhlb3J5_4-nng}

According to the **cell theory** , all living things are made up of
cells, which is the structural unit of living organisms, and living
cells always come from other living cells. In fact, each living thing
begins life as a single cell. Some living things, such as bacteria,
remain single-celled. Other living things, including plants and animals,
grow and develop into many cells. Your own body is made up of an amazing
100 trillion cells! But even you—like all other living things—began life
as a single cell.

Tiny diatoms and whale sharks are all made of cells. Diatoms are about
20 µm in diameter and are made up of one cell, whereas whale sharks can
measure up to 12 meters in length and are made up of billions of cells.

</div>

#### The Gene Theory {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdlbmUgVGhlb3J5_4-hji}

The **gene theory** is the idea that the characteristics of living
organisms are controlled by genes, which are passed from parents to
their offspring. A **gene** is a segment of DNA that has the
instructions to encode a protein. Genes are located on larger
structures, called **chromosomes** , that are found inside every cell.
Chromosomes, in turn, contain large molecules known as DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid). Molecules of DNA are encoded with instructions
that tell cells what to do. To see how this happens, click on the
animation titled *Journey into DNA* at the following link:
[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/dna.html](dna.html) .

#### Homeostasis {#2.html#x-ck12-SG9tZW9zdGFzaXM._4-dcn}

**Homeostasis** , which is maintaining a stable internal environment or
keeping things constant, is not just a characteristic of living things.
It also applies to nature as a whole. Consider the concentration of
oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere, and
this concentration is fairly constant. What keeps the concentration of
oxygen constant? The answer is living things. Most living things need
oxygen to survive, and when they breathe, they remove oxygen from the
atmosphere. On the other hand, many living things, including plants,
give off oxygen when they make food, and this adds oxygen to the
atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is maintained
mainly by the balance between these two processes. A quick overview of
homeostasis can be viewed at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFyt7FJn-UM](watch?v=DFyt7FJn-UM) .

#### Evolution {#2.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9u_4-b7o}

**Evolution** is a change in the characteristics of living things over
time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural
selection, some living things produce more offspring than others, so
they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many
generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of
living things. Evolution explains how living things are changing today
and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that
no longer exist on Earth.

As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their
environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An **adaptation**
is a characteristic that helps a living thing survive and reproduce in a
given environment. Look at the mole in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTA5LVN0YXItbm9zZWQtbW9sZQ..) . It has
tentacles around its nose that it uses to sense things by touch. The
mole lives underground in the soil, where it is always dark. However, by
using its touch organ, it can detect even tiny food items in the soil in
total darkness. The touch organ is an adaptation because it helps the
mole survive in its dark, underground environment.

**What other species do you need to survive?**

Species cannot live alone. All life needs other life to survive. Here
surgeon fish are feeding on the algae growth on this turtle shell, a
classic example of two species needing each other. This is an example of
a symbiotic relationship.

### Interdependence of Living Things {#2.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJkZXBlbmRlbmNlIG9mIExpdmluZyBUaGluZ3M._5-n1w}

All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what
they need, including food, water, and shelter. Their environment
consists of physical factors—such as soil, air, and temperature—and also
of other organisms. An **organism** is an individual living thing. Many
living things interact with other organisms in their environment. In
fact, they may need other organisms in order to survive. This is known
as **interdependence** . For example, living things that cannot make
their own food must eat other organisms for food. Other interactions
between living things include symbiosis and competition.

#### Symbiosis {#2.html#x-ck12-U3ltYmlvc2lz_5-eke}

**Symbiosis** is a close relationship between organisms of different
species in which at least one of the organisms benefits. The other
organism may also benefit, it may be unaffected by the relationship, or
it may be harmed by the relationship. **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTEwLVN5bWJpb3Npcw..) shows an example of
symbiosis. The birds in the picture are able to pick out food from the
fur of the deer. The deer won't eat the birds. In fact, the deer
knowingly lets the birds rest on it. What, if anything, do you think the
deer gets out of the relationship?

**Figure 2.10**

A flock of starlings looks out, before searching for parasites on a red
deer stag.

</div>

#### Competition {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGV0aXRpb24._5-xvk}

**Competition** is a relationship between living things that depend on
the same resources. The resources may be food, water, or anything else
they both need. Competition occurs whenever they both try to get the
same resources in the same place and at the same time. The two organisms
are likely to come into conflict, and the organism with better
adaptations may win out over the other organism.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-dxz}

-   All living things depend on their environment to supply them with
    what they need, including food, water, and shelter.
-   Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of different
    species in which at least one of the organisms benefits.
-   Competition is a relationship between living things that depend on

***Organization of Living Things.*** **What does this mean?**

We know it all starts with the cell. And for some species it ends with
the cell. But for others, the cells come together to form tissues,
tissues form organs, organs form organ systems, and organ systems
combine to form an organism.

### Levels of Organization {#2.html#x-ck12-TGV2ZWxzIG9mIE9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbg.._6-4pq}

The living world can be organized into different levels. For example,
many individual organisms can be organized into the following levels:

-   **Cell** : Basic unit of structure and function of all
    living things.
-   **Tissue** : Group of cells of the same kind. 
-   **Organ** : Structure composed of one or more types of tissues. The
    tissues of an organ work together to perfume a specific function.
    Human organs include the brain, stomach, kidney, and liver. Plant
    organs include roots, stems, and leaves. 
-   **Organ system** : Group of organs that work together to perform a
    certain function. Examples of organ systems in a human include the
    skeletal, nervous, and reproductive systems.
-   **Organism** : Individual living thing that may be made up of one or
    more organ systems.

Examples of these levels of organization are shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTExLU1vdXNl) .

**Figure 2.11**

An individual mouse is made up of several organ systems. The system
shown here is the digestive system, which breaks down food into a form
that cells can use. One of the organs of the digestive system is the
stomach. The stomach, in turn, consists of different types of tissues.
Each type of tissue is made up of cells of the same type.

</div>

There are also levels of organization above the individual organism.
These levels are illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTEyLU9yZ2FuaXNtLXRvLWJpb3NwaGVyZQ..) .

-   Organisms of the same species that live in the same area make up a
    **population** . For example, all of the goldfish living in the same
    area make up a goldfish population.
-   All of the populations that live in the same area make up a
    **community** . The community that includes the goldfish population
    also includes the populations of other fish, coral, and
    other organisms.
-   An **ecosystem** consists of all the living things ( **biotic
    factors** ) in a given area, together with the nonliving environment
    ( **abiotic factors** ). The nonliving environment includes water,
    sunlight, soil, and other physical factors.
-   A group of similar ecosystems with the same general type of physical
    environment is called a **biome** .
-   The **biosphere** is the part of Earth where all life exists,
    including all the land, water, and air where living things can
    be found. The biosphere consists of many different biomes.

#### Diversity of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJzaXR5IG9mIExpZmU._6-gur}

Life on Earth is very diverse. The diversity of living things is called
**biodiversity** . A measure of Earth’s biodiversity is the number of
different species of organisms that live on Earth. At least 10 million
different species live on Earth today. They are commonly grouped into
six different kingdoms. Examples of organisms within each kingdom are
shown in **Figure**

**Are dinosaurs evidence of past life forms?**

Evolution can be described as *a change in species over time* . Dinosaur
fossils are significant evidence of evolution and of past life on Earth.

### Evolution of Life {#2.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIExpZmU._7-hvj}

The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution. Life
began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been
evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple,
single-celled organisms. Much later, the first multicellular organisms
evolved, and after that, Earth’s biodiversity greatly increased.

Today, the most accepted theory of life on Earth is evolution, and there
is a vast amount of evidence supporting this theory. However, this
wasn’t always the case.

#### Darwin and the Theory of Evolution {#2.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2luIGFuZCB0aGUgVGhlb3J5IG9mIEV2b2x1dGlvbg.._7-sc7}

The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes
all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However,
evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published
a book on evolution in 1859 titled *On the Origin of Species* . In the
book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He
also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs.

**Evolution** is a change in the characteristics of living things over
time. As described by Darwin, evolution occurs by a process called
**natural selection** . In natural selection, some members of a species,
being better adapted or suited to their environment, produce more
offspring than others, so they pass "advantageous traits" to their
offspring. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the
characteristics of the species. Evolution explains how living things are
changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient
life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they
generally become better suited for their environment. This is because
they evolve adaptations. An **adaptation** is a trait that helps an
organism survive and reproduce in a given environment.

Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not
well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea
that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw
evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon
in **Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAxLTE1LURhcndpbi1jYXJ0b29u) .
Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects
how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time.
Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had
waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was
only when another scientist, named Alfred Russel Wallace, developed
essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into
print.

**Figure 2.15**

Charles Darwin’s name is linked with the theory of evolution. This
cartoon from the 1870s makes fun of both Darwin and his theory.

</div>

Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his
book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That’s because he
knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn’t know how
characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they
could change over time.

#### Evolutionary Theory After Darwin {#2.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uYXJ5IFRoZW9yeSBBZnRlciBEYXJ3aW4._7-yge}

Since Darwin’s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to
support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from
fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things
are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about
genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of
organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over
time.

Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes
of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the
more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and
chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they
shared a common ancestor in the not-too-distant past. This is just one
of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of
life on Earth.

#### Misconceptions About Evolution {#2.html#x-ck12-TWlzY29uY2VwdGlvbnMgQWJvdXQgRXZvbHV0aW9u_7-mb3}

Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who
disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For
example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how
life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life
changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of
evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, the
theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived
several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about
evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this
fundamental principle of biology.

    been evolving ever since.

**Carbon. Element number six. Right in the middle of the first row of
the Periodic Table.** ***So what?***

Carbon is the most important element to life. Without this element, life
as we know it would not exist. As you will see, carbon is the central
element in compounds necessary for life.

### The Significance of Carbon {#2.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNpZ25pZmljYW5jZSBvZiBDYXJib24._8-mr6}

A compound found mainly in living things is known as an **organic
compound** . Organic compounds make up the cells and other structures of
organisms and carry out life processes. Carbon is the main element in
organic compounds, so carbon is essential to life on Earth. Without
carbon, life as we know it could not exist.

#### Compounds {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG91bmRz_8-cql}

A **compound** is a substance that consists of two or more elements. A
compound has a unique composition that is always the same. The smallest
particle of a compound is called a molecule. Consider water as an
example. A molecule of water always contains one atom of oxygen and two
atoms of hydrogen. The composition of water is expressed by the chemical
formula H ~2~ O. A model of a water molecule is shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTAyYS1XYXRlci1Nb2xlY3VsZQ..) . Water is
not an organic compound.

**Figure 2.16**

A water molecule always has this composition, one atom of oxygen and two
atoms of hydrogen.

</div>

What causes the atoms of a water molecule to “stick” together? The
answer is chemical bonds. A **chemical bond** is a force that holds
molecules together. Chemical bonds form when substances react with one
another. A **chemical reaction** is a process that changes some chemical
substances into others. A chemical reaction is needed to form a
compound. Another chemical reaction is needed to separate the substances
in a compound.

#### Carbon {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9u_8-08d}

Why is carbon so basic to life? The reason is carbon’s ability to form
stable bonds with many elements, including itself. This property allows
carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules. In
fact, there are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living
things! However, the millions of organic compounds can be grouped into
just four major types: **carbohydrates** , **lipids** , **proteins** ,
and **nucleic acids** . You can compare the four types in **Table**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6b3JnYW5pYy1jb21wdW5kcw..) . Each type is
also described below.

Carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids are large molecules
(macromolecules) built from smaller molecules (monomers) through
dehydration reactions. In a dehydration reaction, water is removed as
two monomers are joined together.

**Sugar. Does this look like biological energy?**

As a child, you may have been told that sugar is bad for you. Well,
that's not exactly true. Essentially, carbohydrates are made of sugar,
from a single sugar molecule to thousands of sugar molecules attached
together. Why? One reason is to store energy. But that does not mean you
should eat it by the spoonful.

### Carbohydrates {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9oeWRyYXRlcw.._9-tyv}

Carbohydrates are the most common type of organic compound. A
**carbohydrate** is an organic compound such as sugar or starch, and is
used to store energy. Like most organic compounds, carbohydrates are
built of small, repeating units that form bonds with each other to make
a larger molecule. In the case of carbohydrates, the small repeating
units are called monosaccharides. Carbohydrates contain only carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen.

#### Monosaccharides and Disaccharides {#2.html#x-ck12-TW9ub3NhY2NoYXJpZGVzIGFuZCBEaXNhY2NoYXJpZGVz_9-zr5}

A **monosaccharide** is a simple sugar such as fructose or glucose.
Fructose is found in fruits, whereas glucose generally results from the
digestion of other carbohydrates. **Glucose** (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ) is
used for energy by the cells of most organisms, and is a product of
photosynthesis.

The general formula for a **monosaccharide** is:

(CH ~2~ O) ~n~ ,

where *n* can be any number greater than two. For example, in glucose
*n* is 6, and the formula is:

C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ .

Another monosaccharide, fructose, has the same chemical formula as
glucose, but the atoms are arranged differently. Molecules with the same
chemical formula but with atoms in a different arrangement are called
**isomers** . Compare the glucose and fructose molecules in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvMi0yLTE.) . Can you identify their
differences? The only differences are the positions of some of the
atoms. These differences affect the properties of the two
monosaccharides.

**Figure 2.17**

Sucrose Molecule. This sucrose molecule is a disaccharide. It is made up
of two monosaccharides: glucose on the left and fructose on the right.

</div>

If two monosaccharides bond together, they form a carbohydrate called a
**disaccharide** . An example of a disaccharide is sucrose (table
sugar), which consists of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose (
**Figure** [above](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvMi0yLTE.) ). Monosaccharides and
disaccharides are also called **simple sugars** . They provide the major
source of energy to living cells

#### Polysaccharides {#2.html#x-ck12-UG9seXNhY2NoYXJpZGVz_9-nsj}

A **polysaccharide** is a complex carbohydrate that forms when simple
sugars bind together in a chain. Polysaccharides may contain just a few
simple sugars or thousands of them. Complex carbohydrates have two main
functions: storing energy and forming structures of living things. Some
examples of complex carbohydrates and their functions are shown in
**Table** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Y29tcGxleC1jYXJicw..) . Which

**Oil. Does it mix with water? No. Biologically, why is this
important?**

Oil is a lipid. The property of chemically not being able to mix with
water gives lipids some very important biological functions. Lipids form
the outer membrane of cells. Why?

### Lipids {#2.html#x-ck12-TGlwaWRz_10-fxt}

A **lipid** is an organic compound such as fat or oil. Organisms use
lipids to store energy, but lipids have other important roles as well.
Lipids consist of repeating units called fatty acids. **Fatty acids**
are organic compounds that have the general formula CH ~3~ (CH ~2~ ) ~n~
COOH, where *n* usually ranges from 2 to 28 and is always an even
number. There are two types of fatty acids: saturated fatty acids and
unsaturated fatty acids.

#### Saturated Fatty Acids {#2.html#x-ck12-U2F0dXJhdGVkIEZhdHR5IEFjaWRz_10-8ke}

In **saturated fatty acids** , carbon atoms are bonded to as many
hydrogen atoms as possible. This causes the molecules to form straight
chains, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTAzYS1GYXR0eS1BY2lkcw..) . The straight
chains can be packed together very tightly, allowing them to store
energy in a compact form. This explains why saturated fatty acids are
solids at room temperature. Animals use saturated fatty acids to store
energy.

**Figure 2.18**

Fatty Acids. Saturated fatty acids have straight chains, like the three
fatty acids shown in the upper left. Unsaturated fatty acids have bent
chains, like all the other fatty acids in the figure.

</div>

#### Unsaturated Fatty Acids {#2.html#x-ck12-VW5zYXR1cmF0ZWQgRmF0dHkgQWNpZHM._10-8io}

In **unsaturated fatty acids** , some carbon atoms are not bonded to as
many hydrogen atoms as possible. Instead, they are bonded to other
groups of atoms. Wherever carbon binds with these other groups of atoms,
it causes chains to bend (see **Figure**
[above](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTAzYS1GYXR0eS1BY2lkcw..) ). The bent
chains cannot be packed together very tightly, so unsaturated fatty
acids are liquids at room temperature. Plants use unsaturated fatty
acids to store energy. Some examples are shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTA0LUhlYWx0aHktRmF0cw..) .

#### Types of Lipids {#2.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTGlwaWRz_10-voh}

Lipids may consist of fatty acids alone, or they may contain other
molecules as well. For example, some lipids contain alcohol or phosphate
groups. They include

1.  triglycerides: the main form of stored energy in animals.
2.  phospholipids: the major components of cell membranes.
3.  steroids: serve as chemical messengers and have other roles.

#### Lipids and Diet {#2.html#x-ck12-TGlwaWRz_10IGFuZCBEaWV0-nbw}

Humans need lipids for many vital functions, such as storing energy and
forming cell membranes. Lipids can also supply cells with energy. In
fact, a gram of lipids supplies more than twice as much energy as a gram
of carbohydrates or proteins. Lipids are necessary in the diet for most
of these functions. Although the human body can manufacture most of the
lipids it needs, there are others, called **essential fatty acids** ,
that must be consumed in food. Essential fatty acids include omega-3 and
omega-6 fatty acids. Both of these fatty acids are needed for important
biological processes, not just for energy.

Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids
can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many
may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase
lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for
health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of
most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For
example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing
arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

    acids: saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids.

**You may have been told proteins are good for you. Do these look good
to you?**

Proteins as food. To you, these may not look appetizing (or they might),
but they do provide a nice supply of amino acids, the building blocks of
proteins. Proteins have many important roles, from transporting,
signaling, receiving, and catalyzing to storing, defending, and allowing
for movement. Where do you get the amino acids needed so your cells can
make their own proteins? If you cannot make it, you must eat it.

### Proteins {#2.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbnM._11-7cv}

A **protein** is an organic compound made up of small molecules called
**amino acids** . There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in
the proteins of living organisms. Small proteins may contain just a few
hundred amino acids, whereas large proteins may contain thousands of
amino acids. The largest known proteins are titins, found in muscle,
which are composed from over 27,000 amino acids.

**Figure 2.21**

General Structure of Amino Acids. This model shows the general structure
of all amino acids. Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid
to another. For example, in the amino acid glycine, the side chain is
simply hydrogen (H). In glutamic acid, in contrast, the side chain is CH
~2~ CH ~2~ COOH. Variable side chains give amino acids different
chemical properties. The order of amino acids, together with the
properties of the amino acids, determines the shape of the protein, and
the shape of the protein determines the function of the protein. KEY: H
= hydrogen, N = nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side
chain

</div>

#### Protein Structure {#2.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbiBTdHJ1Y3R1cmU._11-ovx}

When amino acids bind together, they form a long chain called a
**polypeptide** . A protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains.
A protein may have up to four levels of structure. The lowest level, a
protein’s primary structure, is its sequence of amino acids. Higher
levels of protein structure are described in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTA1LXByb3RlaW4tc3RydWN0dXJlcw..) . The
complex structures of different proteins give them unique properties,
which they need to carry out their various jobs in living organisms. You

#### Functions of Proteins {#2.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIFByb3RlaW5z_11-6ln}

Proteins play many important roles in living things. Some proteins help
cells keep their shape (structural proteins), some, such as connective
and motor proteins, make up muscle tissues, and some transport items in
and out of cells (transport proteins). Some proteins act as signals, and
other proteins receive those signals. **Enzymes** are proteins that
speed up chemical reactions in cells. Other proteins are **antibodies**
, which bind to foreign substances such as bacteria and target them for
destruction. Still other proteins carry messages or transport materials.
For example, human red blood cells contain a protein called
**hemoglobin** , which binds with oxygen. Hemoglobin allows the blood to
carry oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body. A model of the
hemoglobin molecule is shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTA2LWhlbW9nbG9iaW4.) .

#### Proteins and Diet {#2.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGVpbnMgYW5kIERpZXQ._11-aod}

Proteins in the diet are necessary for life. Dietary proteins are broken
down into their component amino acids when food is digested. Cells can
then use the components to build new proteins. Humans are able to
synthesize all but eight of the twenty common amino acids. These eight
amino acids, called **essential amino acids** , must be consumed in
foods. Like dietary carbohydrates and lipids, dietary proteins can also
be broken down to provide cells with energy.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-tas}

-   Proteins are organic compounds made up of amino acids.
-   A protein may have up to four levels of structure. The complex

**You may have heard that something is "encoded in your DNA." What does
that mean?**

Nucleic acids. Essentially the "instructions" or "blueprints" of life.
Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the unique blueprints to make the
proteins that give you your traits. Half of these blueprints come from
your mother, and half from your father. Therefore, every person that has
ever lived - except for identical twins - has his or her own unique set
of blueprints - or instructions - or DNA.

### Nucleic Acids {#2.html#x-ck12-TnVjbGVpYyBBY2lkcw.._12-e3v}

A **nucleic acid** is an organic compound, such as DNA or RNA, that is
built of small units called **nucleotides** . Many nucleotides bind
together to form a chain called a **polynucleotide** . The nucleic acid
**DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid) consists of two polynucleotide chains.
The nucleic acid **RNA** (ribonucleic acid) consists of just one
polynucleotide chain.

An overview of DNA can be seen at

#### Structure of Nucleic Acids {#2.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIE51Y2xlaWMgQWNpZHM._12-7vt}

Each nucleotide consists of three smaller molecules:

1.  sugar
2.  phosphate group
3.  nitrogen base

If you look at **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTA3LU51Y2xlaWMtYWNpZA..) , you will see
that the sugar of one nucleotide binds to the phosphate group of the
next nucleotide. These two molecules alternate to form the backbone of
the nucleotide chain. This backbone is known as the *sugar-phosphate
backbone.*

The nitrogen bases in a nucleic acid stick out from the backbone. There
are four different types of bases: cytosine (C), adenine (A), guanine
(G), and either thymine (T) in DNA, or uracil (U) in RNA. In DNA, bonds
form between bases on the two nucleotide chains and hold the chains
together. Each type of base binds with just one other type of base:
cytosine always binds with guanine, and adenine always binds with
thymine. These pairs of bases are called **complementary base pairs** .

Nucleic Acid. Sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of a
polynucleotide chain. Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases hold
two polynucleotide chains together.

</div>

The binding of complementary bases allows DNA molecules to take their
well-known shape, called a **double helix** , which is shown in
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-RE5BZm9sZGluZ0E.) . A double helix is
like a spiral staircase. The double helix shape forms naturally and is
very strong, making the two polynucleotide chains difficult to break
apart.

#### Roles of Nucleic Acids {#2.html#x-ck12-Um9sZXMgb2YgTnVjbGVpYyBBY2lkcw.._12-wel}

DNA is also known as the hereditary material or genetic information. It
is found in genes, and its sequence of bases makes up a code. Between
"starts" and "stops," the code carries instructions for the correct
sequence of amino acids in a protein (see **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIuMi4xMA..) ). DNA and RNA have different
functions relating to the genetic code and proteins. Like a set of
blueprints, DNA contains the genetic instructions for the correct
sequence of amino acids in proteins. RNA uses the information in DNA to
assemble the correct amino acids and help make the protein. The
information in DNA is passed from parent cells to daughter cells
whenever cells divide. The information in DNA is also passed from
parents to offspring when organisms reproduce. This is how inherited
characteristics are passed from one generation to the next.

**Understanding chemistry is essential to fully understand biology.
Why?**

A general understanding of chemistry is necessary to understand biology.
Essentially, our cells are just thousands of chemicals — made of
elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur
— in just the right combinations. And these chemicals combine through
chemical reactions.

### Chemical Reactions {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25z_13-fnd}

The element chlorine (Cl) is a greenish poison. Would you eat chlorine?
Of course not, but you often eat a compound containing chlorine. In
fact, you probably eat this chlorine compound just about every day. Do
you know what it is? It’s table salt. Table salt is sodium chloride
(NaCl), which forms when chlorine and sodium (Na) combine in certain
proportions. How does chlorine, a toxic green chemical, change into
harmless white table salt? It happens in a chemical reaction.

A **chemical reaction** is a process that changes some chemical
substances into others. A substance that starts a chemical reaction is
called a **reactant** , and a substance that forms as a result of a
chemical reaction is called a **product** . During a chemical reaction,
the reactants are used up to create the products.

An example of a chemical reaction is the burning of methane. In this
chemical reaction, the reactants are methane (CH ~4~ ) and oxygen (O ~2~
), and the products are carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water (H ~2~ O). A
chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds.
When methane burns, bonds break in the methane and oxygen molecules, and
new bonds form in the molecules of carbon dioxide and water.

#### Chemical Equations {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgRXF1YXRpb25z_13-kal}

A chemical reaction can be represented by a **chemical equation** . For
example, the burning of methane can be represented by the chemical
equation

CH ~4~ + 2O ~2~ → CO ~2~ + 2H ~2~ O

The arrow in a chemical equation separates the reactants from the
products and shows the direction in which the reaction proceeds. If the
reaction could occur in the opposite direction as well, two arrows
pointing in opposite directions would be used. The number 2 in front of
O ~2~ and H ~2~ O shows that two oxygen molecules and two water
molecules are involved in the reaction. (With no number in front of a
chemical symbol, just one molecule is involved.)

#### Conservation of Matter {#2.html#x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmF0aW9uIG9mIE1hdHRlcg.._13-mif}

In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change;
there is the same amount of each element in the products as there was in
the reactants. This is because matter is always conserved. The
conservation of matter is reflected in a reaction’s chemical equation.
The same number of atoms of each element appears on each side of the
arrow. For example, in the chemical equation above, there are four
hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow. Can you find all four of them
on each side of the equation?

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-p45}

-   A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical
    substances into others. During a chemical reaction, the reactants
    are used up to create the products.
-   In a chemical reaction, matter is always conserved.

**What is energy? Where does your energy come from? Can energy be
recycled?**

This team of ants is breaking down a dead tree. A classic example of
teamwork. And all that work takes energy. In fact, each chemical
reaction - the chemical reactions that allow the cells in those ants to
do the *work* - needs energy to get started. And all that energy comes
from the food the ants eat. Whatever eats the ants gets their energy
from the ants. Energy passes through an ecosystem in one direction only.

### Chemical Reactions and Energy {#2.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25zIGFuZCBFbmVyZ3k._14-ohx}

Chemical reactions always involve energy. **Energy** is a property of
matter that is defined as the ability to do work. When methane burns,
for example, it releases energy in the form of heat and light. Other
chemical reactions absorb energy rather than release it.

#### Exothermic Reactions {#2.html#x-ck12-RXhvdGhlcm1pYyBSZWFjdGlvbnM._14-kwv}

A chemical reaction that releases energy (as heat) is called an
**exothermic reaction** . This type of reaction can be represented by a
general chemical equation:

Reactants → Products + Heat

In addition to methane burning, another example of an exothermic
reaction is chlorine combining with sodium to form table salt. This
reaction also releases energy.

#### Endothermic Reaction {#2.html#x-ck12-RW5kb3RoZXJtaWMgUmVhY3Rpb24._14-25g}

A chemical reaction that absorbs energy is called an **endothermic
reaction** . This type of reaction can also be represented by a general
chemical equation:

Reactants + Heat → Products

Did you ever use a chemical cold pack? The pack cools down because of an
endothermic reaction. When a tube inside the pack is broken, it releases
a chemical that reacts with water inside the pack. This reaction absorbs
heat energy and quickly cools down the pack.

#### Activation Energy {#2.html#x-ck12-QWN0aXZhdGlvbiBFbmVyZ3k._14-qsb}

All chemical reactions need energy to get started. Even reactions that
release energy need a boost of energy in order to begin. The energy
needed to start a chemical reaction is called **activation energy** .
Activation energy is like the push a child needs to start going down a
playground slide. The push gives the child enough energy to start
moving, but once she starts, she keeps moving without being pushed
again. Activation energy is illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTExLWFjdGl2YXRpb24tZW5lcmd5) .

**Figure 2.27**

Activation Energy. Activation energy provides the “push” needed to start
a chemical reaction. Is the chemical reaction in this figure an
exothermic or endothermic reaction?

</div>

Why do all chemical reactions need energy to get started? In order for
reactions to begin, reactant molecules must bump into each other, so
they must be moving, and movement requires energy. When reactant
molecules bump together, they may repel each other because of
intermolecular forces pushing them apart. Overcoming these forces so the
molecules can come together and react also takes energy.

    releases energy is an exothermic reaction, and a chemical reaction

**What do you get when you cross biology and chemistry?**

Hummingbirds, with their tiny bodies and high levels of activity, have
the highest metabolic rates of any animals — roughly a dozen times that
of a pigeon and a hundred times that of an elephant. The metabolic rate,
or rate of metabolism, has to do with the amount of energy the organism
uses. And that energy is used to drive the chemical reactions in cells —
or the biochemical reactions. And, of course, it is all the biochemical
reactions that allow the cells function properly, and maintain life.

### Biochemical Reactions {#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvY2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25z_15-epw}

**Biochemical reactions** are chemical reactions that take place inside
the cells of living things. The field of **biochemistry** demonstrates
that knowledge of chemistry as well as biology is needed to understand
fully the life processes of organisms at the level of the cell. The sum
of all the biochemical reactions in an organism is called **metabolism**
. It includes both exothermic and endothermic reactions.

#### Types of Biochemical Reactions {#2.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQmlvY2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25z_15-3ma}

Exothermic reactions in organisms are called **catabolic reactions** .
These reactions break down molecules into smaller units and release
energy. An example of a catabolic reaction is the breakdown of glucose,
which releases energy that cells need to carry out life processes.
Endothermic reactions in organisms are called **anabolic reactions** .
These reactions build up bigger molecules from smaller ones. An example
of an anabolic reaction is the joining of amino acids to form a protein.
Which type of reactions—catabolic or anabolic—do you think occur when
your body digests food?

**What is a biological catalyst?**

This super fast train can obviously reach great speeds. And there's a
lot of technology that helps this train go fast. Speaking of helping
things go fast brings us to enzymes. Life could not exist without
enzymes. Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up
biochemical reactions.

### Enzymes {#2.html#x-ck12-RW56eW1lcw.._16-chm}

#### Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions {#2.html#x-ck12-RW56eW1lcyBhbmQgQmlvY2hlbWljYWwgUmVhY3Rpb25z_16-q9v}

Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the
conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms
is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life
processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that
it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most
biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A **catalyst** is
a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts
are called **enzymes** . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.

Like other catalysts, enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they
control. They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the
reactions. Instead, they may be used over and over again. Unlike other
catalysts, enzymes are usually highly specific for particular chemical
reactions. They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions.

Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up reactions. They can
catalyze up to several million reactions per second. As a result, the
difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes
may be enormous. A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even
days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme, but
less than a second with an enzyme.

#### Importance of Enzymes {#2.html#x-ck12-SW1wb3J0YW5jZSBvZiBFbnp5bWVz_16-jlf}

Enzymes are involved in most of the biochemical reactions that take
place in organisms. About 4,000 such reactions are known to be catalyzed
by enzymes, but the number may be even higher. Enzymes allow reactions
to occur at the rate necessary for life.

In animals, an important function of enzymes is to help digest food.
Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of
carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules the body can
use. Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down
food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they
need to survive.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._16-4ji}

-   Enzymes are biological catalysts. They speed up
    biochemical reactions.

**Do cells have one enzyme with lots of functions, or many enzymes, each
with just one function?**

Enzymes. Magical proteins necessary for life. So how do enzymes work?
How do they catalyze just one specific biochemical reaction? In a
puzzle, only two pieces will fit together properly. Understanding that
is one of the main steps in understanding how enzymes work.

### Enzyme Function {#2.html#x-ck12-RW56eW1lIEZ1bmN0aW9u_17-17v}

How do **enzymes** speed up biochemical reactions so dramatically? Like
all **catalysts** , enzymes work by lowering the **activation energy**
of chemical reactions. Activation energy is the energy needed to start a
chemical reaction. This is illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvMi0zLW41) . The biochemical reaction shown in
the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without
the enzyme as it does with the enzyme.

An animation of how enzymes work can be seen at

![How enzyme changes activation
energy](ck12_2_files/20150914103928640670.png "How enzyme changes activation energy")

**Figure 2.28**

The reaction represented by this graph is a combustion reaction
involving the reactants glucose (C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ ) and oxygen (O ~2~
). The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water
(H ~2~ O). Energy is also released during the reaction. The enzyme
speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the
reaction to start. Compare the activation energy with and without the
enzyme.

</div>

Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed
for reactants to come together and react. For example:

-   Enzymes bring reactants together so they don’t have to expend energy
    moving about until they collide at random. Enzymes bind both
    reactant molecules (called the **substrate** ), tightly and
    specifically, at a site on the enzyme molecule called the **active
    site** ( **Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvMi0zLTQ.) ).
-   By binding reactants at the active site, enzymes also position
    reactants correctly, so they do not have to overcome intermolecular
    forces that would otherwise push them apart. This allows the
    molecules to interact with less energy.
-   Enzymes may also allow reactions to occur by different pathways that
    have lower activation energy.

The active site is specific for the reactants of the biochemical
reaction the enzyme catalyzes. Similar to puzzle pieces fitting
together, the active site can only bind certain substrates.

site](ck12_2_files/20150914103928847650.jpeg "Enzyme binding reactant at active site")

**Figure 2.29**

This enzyme molecule binds reactant molecules—called substrate—at its
active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This brings the
reactants together and positions them correctly so the reaction can
occur. After the reaction, the products are released from the enzyme’s
active site. This frees up the enzyme so it can catalyze additional
reactions.

</div>

The activities of enzymes also depend on the temperature, ionic
conditions, and the pH of the surroundings. Some enzymes work best at
acidic pHs, while others work best in neutral environments.

-   Digestive enzymes secreted in the acidic environment (low pH) of the
    stomach help break down proteins into smaller molecules. The main
    digestive enzyme in the stomach is **pepsin** , which works best at
    a pH of about 1.5. These enzymes would not work optimally at
    other pHs. Trypsin is another enzyme in the digestive system, which
    breaks protein chains in food into smaller parts. Trypsin works in
    the small intestine, which is not an acidic environment. Trypsin's
    optimum pH is about 8.
-   Biochemical reactions are optimal at physiological temperatures. For
    example, most biochemical reactions work best at the normal body
    temperature of 98.6˚F. Many enzymes lose function at lower and
    higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, an enzyme’s
    shape deteriorates. Only when the temperature comes back to normal
    does the enzyme regain its shape and normal activity.

**Dihydrogen oxide or dihydrogen monoxide. Does this chemical sound
dangerous?**

Another name for this compound is…water. Water can create some
absolutely beautiful sights. Iguassu Falls is the largest series of
waterfalls on the planet, located in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.
And water is necessary for life. The importance of water to life cannot
be emphasized enough. All life needs water. Life started in water.
Essentially, without this simple three atom molecule, life would not
exist.

### Water {#2.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXI._18-wly}

Water, like carbon, has a special role in living things. It is needed by
all known forms of life. Water is a simple molecule, containing just
three atoms. Nonetheless, water’s structure gives it unique properties
that help explain why it is vital to all living organisms.

#### Water, Water Everywhere {#2.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIsIFdhdGVyIEV2ZXJ5d2hlcmU._18-ztl}

Water is a common chemical substance on planet Earth. In fact, Earth is
sometimes called the "water planet" because almost 75% of its surface is
covered with water. If you look at **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXJEaXN0cmlidXRpb25PbkVhcnRo) , you will see
where Earth’s water is found. The term *water* generally refers to its
liquid state, and water is a liquid over a wide range of temperatures on
Earth. However, water also occurs on Earth as a solid (ice) and as a gas
(water vapor).

Most of the water on Earth consists of saltwater in the oceans. What

</div>

#### Structure and Properties of Water {#2.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBQcm9wZXJ0aWVzIG9mIFdhdGVy_18-pzk}

No doubt, you are already aware of some of the properties of water. For
example, you probably know that water is tasteless and odorless. You
also probably know that water is transparent, which means that light can
pass through it. This is important for organisms that live in the water,
because some of them need sunlight to make food.

**Chemical Structure of Water**

To understand some of water’s properties, you need to know more about
its chemical structure. As you have seen, each molecule of water
consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. The oxygen
atom in a water molecule attracts negatively-charged electrons more
strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. As a result, the oxygen atom has a
slightly negative charge, and the hydrogen atoms have a slightly
positive charge. A difference in electrical charge between different
parts of the same molecule is called **polarity** , making water a
**polar molecule** . The diagram in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXJQb2xhcml0eS0wMQ..) shows water’s polarity.

**Figure 2.31**

Water Molecule. This diagram shows the positive and negative parts of a
water molecule. It also depicts how a charge, such as on an ion (Na or
Cl, for example) can interact with a water molecule.

</div>

Opposites attract when it comes to charged molecules. In the case of
water, the positive (hydrogen) end of one water molecule is attracted to
the negative (oxygen) end of a nearby water molecule. Because of this
attraction, weak bonds form between adjacent water molecules, as shown
in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTE1LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWJvbmRpbmc.) . The type
of bond that forms between molecules is called a **hydrogen bond** .
Bonds between molecules are not as strong as bonds within molecules.
There are just many more hydrogen bonds in water (between water
molecules) than there are covalent bonds within a molecule. The hydrogen
bonds may not be strong, but in water they are strong enough to hold
together nearby molecules.

water molecules. How do you think this might affect water’s properties?

</div>

**Properties of Water**

Hydrogen bonds between water molecules explain some of water’s
properties. For example, hydrogen bonds explain why water molecules tend
to stick together. Have you ever watched water drip from a leaky faucet
or from a melting icicle? If you have, then you know that water always
falls in drops rather than as separate molecules. The dew drops in
**Figure** [below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTE2LWRldy1kcm9wcw..) are
another example of water molecules sticking together.

Droplets of Dew. Drops of dew cling to a spider web in this picture. Can

</div>

Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of
100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling point, most water on Earth is
in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid
state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to
expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower
density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means
that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on
top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to
survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice.

#### Water and Life {#2.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgYW5kIExpZmU._18-sw2}

The human body is about 70% water (not counting the water in body fat,
which varies from person to person). The body needs all this water to
function normally. Just why is so much water required by human beings
and other organisms? Water can dissolve many substances that organisms
need, and it is necessary for many biochemical reactions. The examples
below are among the most important biochemical processes that occur in
living things, but they are just two of many ways that water is involved
in biochemical reactions.

-   Photosynthesis—In this process, cells use the energy in sunlight to
    change carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen. Water is a
    reactant in this process. The reactions of photosynthesis can be
    represented by the chemical equation

6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Energy → C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ .

-   Cellular respiration—In this process, cells break down glucose in
    the presence of oxygen and release carbon dioxide, water (a
    product), and energy. The reactions of cellular respiration can be
    represented by the chemical equation

C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ → 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Energy.

Water is involved in many other biochemical reactions. As a result, just
about all life processes depend on water. Clearly, life as we know it
could not exist without water.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-qof}

-   Water is needed by all known forms of life.
-   Due to the difference in the distribution of charge, water is a
    polar molecule.

**Acids and bases. Why are these important in biology?**

It comes back to a number of biological processes. For example, enzymes
work best at specific levels of acids or bases. Take your stomach, a
very acidic environment. The enzymes that work in that environment could
not work in your mouth. What would your food taste like if your mouth
was also a very acidic environment?

### Acids and Bases {#2.html#x-ck12-QWNpZHMgYW5kIEJhc2Vz_19-nfc}

Water is the main ingredient of many solutions. A **solution** is a
mixture of two or more substances that has the same composition
throughout. Some solutions are acids and some are bases. To understand
acids and bases, you need to know more about pure water. In pure water
(such as distilled water), a tiny fraction of water molecules naturally
breaks down to form ions. An **ion** is an electrically charged atom or
molecule. The breakdown of water is represented by the chemical equation

2 H ~2~ O → H ~3~ O ^+^ + OH ^-^

The products of this reaction are a hydronium ion (H ~3~ O ^+^ ) and a
hydroxide ion (OH ^-^ ). The hydroxide ion, which has a negative charge,
forms when a water molecule gives up a positively charged hydrogen ion
(H ^+^ ). The hydronium ion, which has positive charge, forms when
another water molecule accepts the hydrogen ion.

#### Acidity and pH {#2.html#x-ck12-QWNpZGl0eSBhbmQgcEg._19-agz}

The concentration of hydronium ions in a solution is known as
**acidity** . In pure water, the concentration of hydronium ions is very
low; only about 1 in 10 million water molecules naturally breaks down to
form a hydronium ion. As a result, pure water is essentially neutral.
Acidity is measured on a scale called **pH** , as shown in **Figure**
[below](#2.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAyLTE3LXBIU2NhbGVB) . Pure water has a pH
of 7, so the point of neutrality on the pH scale is 7.

![The pH Scale](ck12_2_files/20150914103930536451.png "The pH Scale")

**Figure 2.34**

**Acidity and the pH Scale** Water has a pH of 7, so this is the point
of neutrality on the pH scale. Acids have a pH less than 7, and bases
have a pH greater than 7. Approximate pHs of examples are shown.

</div>

#### Acids {#2.html#x-ck12-QWNpZHM._19-sz0}

If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure
water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is
called an **acid** . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the
pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower
its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes
sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach
acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of
mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such
as glass.

#### Bases {#2.html#x-ck12-QmFzZXM._19-1wg}

If a solution has a lower concentration of hydronium ions than pure
water, it has a pH higher than 7. A solution with a pH higher than 7 is
called a **base** . Bases, such as baking soda, have a bitter taste.
Like strong acids, strong bases can harm organisms and damage materials.
For example, lye can burn the skin, and bleach can remove the color from
clothing.

#### Acids and Bases in Organisms {#2.html#x-ck12-QWNpZHMgYW5kIEJhc2Vz_19IGluIE9yZ2FuaXNtcw..-ao7}

Acids and bases are important in living things because most enzymes can
do their job only at a certain level of acidity. Cells secrete acids and
bases to maintain the proper pH for enzymes to work. For example, every
time you digest food, acids and bases are at work in your digestive
system. Consider the acidic environment of the stomach. The acidic
environment helps with the digestion of food. The enzyme pepsin, which
helps break down proteins in the stomach can only function optimally in
the low pH environment. The stomach secretes a strong acid that allows
pepsin to work, and the stomach to do its job. However, when stomach
contents enter the small intestine, the acid must be neutralized. This
is because enzymes in the small intestine need a basic environment in
order to work. An organ called the pancreas secretes a strong base into
the small intestine, and this base neutralizes the acid.

### Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-bsf}

## Summary {#2.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-sv8}

The scientific method is the process by which biological information,
like that of all other sciences, has been identified. This has resulted
in a number of important biological scientific theories, including the
cell theory and the theory of evolution. All life is built around
carbon, and four categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids,
proteins, and nucleic acids. One particular type of protein, enzymes,
are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at
the rate necessary to maintain life. One other molecule, water, is also
essential to life, though water is not an organic compound.

**What is a cell?**

It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the
smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit
necessary for life. But whatever it is, a cell **is** necessary for
life. The *Cell Biology* chapter will discuss some of the fundamental
properties of the cell, with lessons that include the cell structure,
transport in and out of the cell, energy metabolism, and cell division
and reproduction.

**What's the same between a bacterial cell and one of your cells?**

There are many different types of cells, but they all have certain parts
in common. As this image of human blood shows, cells come in different
shapes and sizes. The shapes and sizes directly influence the function
of the cell. Yet, all cells - cells from the smallest bacteria to those
in the largest whale - do some similar functions, so they do have parts
in common.

### Common Parts of Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29tbW9uIFBhcnRzIG9mIENlbGxz-38p}

#### Discovery of Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-RGlzY292ZXJ5IG9mIENlbGxz-iye}

The first time the word *cell* was used to refer to these tiny units of
life was in 1665 by a British scientist named Robert Hooke. Hooke was
one of the earliest scientists to study living things under a
microscope. The microscopes of his day were not very strong, but Hooke
was still able to make an important discovery. When he looked at a thin
slice of cork under his microscope, he was surprised to see what looked
like a honeycomb. Hooke made the drawing in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTAxLUhvb2tlLWNvcms.) to show what he
saw. As you can see, the cork was made up of many tiny units, which
Hooke called cells.

**Figure 3.1**

Cork Cells. This is what Robert Hooke saw when he looked at a thin slice
of cork under his microscope. What type of material is cork? Do you know
where cork comes from?

</div>

Soon after Robert Hooke discovered cells in cork, Anton van Leeuwenhoek
in Holland made other important discoveries using a microscope.
Leeuwenhoek made his own microscope lenses, and he was so good at it
that his microscope was more powerful than other microscopes of his day.
In fact, Leeuwenhoek’s microscope was almost as strong as modern light
microscopes.

Using his microscope, Leeuwenhoek discovered tiny animals such as
rotifers. Leeuwenhoek also discovered human blood cells. He even scraped
plaque from his own teeth and observed it under the microscope. What do
you think Leeuwenhoek saw in the plaque? He saw tiny living things with
a single cell that he named *animalcules* (“tiny animals”). Today, we
call Leeuwenhoek’s animalcules bacteria.

#### The Cell Theory {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbGwgVGhlb3J5-yjw}

The Cell Theory is one of the fundamental theories of biology. For two
centuries after the discovery of the microscope by Robert Hooke and
Anton van Leeuwenhoek, biologists found cells everywhere. Biologists in
the early part of the 19 ^th^ century suggested that all living things
were made of cells, but the role of cells as the primary building block
of life was not discovered until 1839 when two German scientists,
Theodor Schwann, a zoologist (studies animals), and Matthias Jakob
Schleiden, a botanist (studies plants), suggested that cells were the
basic unit of structure and function of all life. Later, in 1858, the
German doctor Rudolf Virchow observed that cells divide to produce more
cells. He proposed that all cells arise only from other cells. The
collective observations of all three scientists form the Cell Theory,
which states that:

-   all organisms are made up of one or more cells,
-   all the life functions of an organism occur within cells,
-   all cells come from preexisting cells.

#### Cell Diversity {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBEaXZlcnNpdHk.-jpy}

Cells with different functions often have different shapes. The cells
pictured in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTA1LWNlbGwtc2hhcGVz) are just a few
examples of the many different shapes that cells may have. Each type of
cell in the figure has a shape that helps it do its job. For example,
the job of the nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells. The nerve
cell has many long extensions that reach out in all directions, allowing
it to pass messages to many other cells at once. Do you see the
tail-like projections on the algae cells? Algae live in water, and their
tails help them swim. Pollen grains have spikes that help them stick to
insects such as bees. How do you think the spikes help the pollen grains
do their job? ( *Hint:* Insects pollinate flowers.)

shapes of these cells related to their functions?

#### Four Common Parts of a Cell {#3.html#x-ck12-Rm91ciBDb21tb24gUGFydHMgb2YgYSBDZWxs-7vp}

Although cells are diverse, all cells have certain parts in common. The
parts include a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA.

1.  The **plasma membrane** (also called the **cell membrane** ) is a
    thin coat of lipids that surrounds a cell. It forms the physical
    boundary between the cell and its environment, so you can think of
    it as the ‘‘skin’’ of the cell.
2.  **Cytoplasm** refers to all of the cellular material inside the
    plasma membrane, other than the nucleus. Cytoplasm is made up of a
    watery substance called **cytosol** , and contains other cell
    structures such as ribosomes.
3.  **Ribosomes** are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins
    are made.
4.  **DNA** is a nucleic acid found in cells. It contains the genetic
    instructions that cells need to make proteins.

These parts are common to all cells, from organisms as different as
bacteria and human beings. How did all known organisms come to have such
similar cells? The similarities show that all life on Earth has a common
evolutionary history.

**How many different types of cells are there?**

There are many different types of cells. For example, in you there are
blood cells and skin cells and bone cells and even bacteria. Here we
have drawings of bacteria and human cells. Can you tell which depicts
various types of bacteria? However, all cells - whether from bacteria,
human, or any other organism - will be one of two general types. In
fact, all cells other than bacteria will be one type, and bacterial
cells will be the other. And it all depends on how the cell stores its
DNA.

### Two Types of Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-VHdvIFR5cGVzIG9mIENlbGxz_1-yuv}

There is another basic cell structure that is present in many but not
all living cells: the nucleus. The **nucleus** of a cell is a structure
in the cytoplasm that is surrounded by a membrane (the nuclear membrane)
and contains, and protects, most of the cell's DNA. Based on whether
they have a nucleus, there are two basic types of cells: prokaryotic
cells and eukaryotic cells. You can watch animations of both types of
cells at the link below.
[http://www.learnerstv.com/animation/animation.php?ani=162&cat=biology](animation.php?ani=162&cat=biology)

#### Prokaryotic Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90aWMgQ2VsbHM._1-ox0}

**Prokaryotic cells** are cells without a nucleus. The DNA in
prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm rather than enclosed within a
nuclear membrane. Prokaryotic cells are found in single-celled
organisms, such as bacteria, like the one shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTA2LXByb2thcnlvdGljLWNlbGw.) . Organisms
with prokaryotic cells are called **prokaryotes** . They were the first
type of organisms to evolve and are still the most common organisms
today.

#### Eukaryotic Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-RXVrYXJ5b3RpYyBDZWxscw.._1-t3k}

**Eukaryotic cells** are cells that contain a nucleus. A typical
eukaryotic cell is shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTA3LWV1a2FyeW90aWMtY2VsbA..) .
Eukaryotic cells are usually larger than prokaryotic cells, and they are
found mainly in multicellular organisms. Organisms with eukaryotic cells
are called **eukaryotes** , and they range from fungi to people.

Eukaryotic cells also contain other organelles besides the nucleus. An
**organelle** is a structure within the cytoplasm that performs a
specific job in the cell. Organelles called mitochondria, for example,
provide energy to the cell, and organelles called vacuoles store
substances in the cell. Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to carry out
more functions than prokaryotic cells can. This allows eukaryotic cells
to have greater cell specificity than prokaryotic cells. Ribosomes, the
organelle where proteins are made, are the only organelles in
prokaryotic cells.

In some ways, a cell resembles a plastic bag full of Jell-O. Its basic
structure is a plasma membrane filled with cytoplasm. Like Jell-O
containing mixed fruit, the cytoplasm of the cell also contains various
structures, such as a nucleus and other organelles. You can also explore

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-rkk}

-   Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus.
-   Eukaryotic cells are cells that contain a nucleus.

**What is a virus? Is it even a living organism?**

This alien-looking thing is a virus. But is it prokaryotic or

[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTA4LXZpcnVzZXM.) , are tiny particles
that may cause disease. Human diseases caused by viruses include the
common cold and flu. Do you think viruses are prokaryotes or eukaryotes?
The answer may surprise you. Viruses are not cells at all, so they are
neither prokaryotes nor eukaryotes.

illness in humans. What is a virus? Is it a cell? Is it even alive?

</div>

Viruses contain DNA but not much else. They lack the other parts shared
by all cells, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes.
Therefore, viruses are not cells, but are they alive? All living things
not only have cells; they are also capable of reproduction. Viruses
cannot reproduce by themselves. Instead, they infect living hosts, and
use the hosts’ cells to make copies of their own DNA. Viruses also do
not have their own metabolism or maintain homeostasis. For these
reasons, most scientists do not consider viruses to be living things.

**All cells have a plasma membrane. This membrane surrounds the cell. So
what is its role?**

Can molecules enter and leave the cell? Yes. Can anything or everything
enter or leave? No. So, what determines what can go in or out? Is it the
nucleus? The DNA? Or the plasma membrane?

### The Plasma Membrane {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsYXNtYSBNZW1icmFuZQ.._3-ela}

The **plasma membrane** (also known as the **cell membrane** ) forms a
barrier between the cytoplasm inside the cell and the environment
outside the cell. It protects and supports the cell and also controls
everything that enters and leaves the cell. It allows only certain
substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out. The ability
to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as
selective permeability or **semipermeability** . To understand how the
plasma membrane controls what crosses into or out of the cell, you need
to know its composition.

The plasma membrane is discussed at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aSfoB8Cmic](watch?v=-aSfoB8Cmic)
(6:16).

#### A Phospholipid Bilayer {#3.html#x-ck12-QSBQaG9zcGhvbGlwaWQgQmlsYXllcg.._3-k1c}

The plasma membrane is composed mainly of phospholipids, which consist
of fatty acids and alcohol. The phospholipids in the plasma membrane are
arranged in two layers, called a **phospholipid bilayer** . As shown in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-UGhvc3Bob2xpcGlkLTAxLTAxQQ..) , each
phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The head “loves” water (
**hydrophilic** ) and the tails “hate” water ( **hydrophobic** ). The
water-hating tails are on the interior of the membrane, whereas the
water-loving heads point outwards, toward either the cytoplasm or the
fluid that surrounds the cell.

Molecules that are hydrophobic can easily pass through the plasma
membrane, if they are small enough, because they are water-hating like
the interior of the membrane. Molecules that are hydrophilic, on the
other hand, cannot pass through the plasma membrane—at least not without
help—because they are water-loving like the exterior of the membrane,
and are therefore excluded from the interior of the membrane.

**Can anything or everything move in or out of the cell?**

No. It is the semipermeable plasma membrane that determines what can
enter and leave the cell. So, if not everything can cross the membrane,
how do certain things get across?

### Membrane Proteins {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVtYnJhbmUgUHJvdGVpbnM._4-nva}

The plasma membrane contains molecules other than phospholipids,
primarily other lipids and proteins. The green molecules in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvSS0wMy0wMi0wMw..) , for example, are the
lipid cholesterol. Molecules of cholesterol help the plasma membrane
keep its shape. Many of the proteins in the plasma membrane assist other
substances in crossing the membrane.

The plasma membranes also contain certain types of proteins. A
**membrane protein** is a protein molecule that is attached to, or
associated with, the membrane of a cell or an organelle. Membrane
proteins can be put into two groups based on how the protein is
associated with the membrane.

**Integral membrane proteins** are permanently embedded within the
plasma membrane. They have a range of important functions. Such
functions include channeling or transporting molecules across the
membrane. Other integral proteins act as cell receptors. Integral
membrane proteins can be classified according to their relationship with
the bilayer:

-   Transmembrane proteins span the entire plasma membrane.
    Transmembrane proteins are found in all types of
    biological membranes.
-   Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the membrane
    from only one side.

Some integral membrane proteins are responsible for cell adhesion
(sticking of a cell to another cell or surface). On the outside of cell
membranes and attached to some of the proteins are carbohydrate chains
that act as labels that identify the cell type. Shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvSS0wMy0wMi0wMw..) are two different types of
membrane proteins and associated molecules.

**Peripheral membrane proteins** are proteins that are only temporarily
associated with the membrane. They can be easily removed, which allows
them to be involved in cell signaling. Peripheral proteins can also be
attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can stick into a small
portion of the lipid bilayer by themselves. Peripheral membrane proteins
are often associated with ion channels and transmembrane receptors. Most
peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic.

**Figure 3.7**

Some of the membrane proteins make up a major transport system that
moves molecules and ions through the polar phospholipid bilayer.

</div>

#### The Fluid Mosaic Model {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZsdWlkIE1vc2FpYyBNb2RlbA.._4-qqc}

In 1972 S.J. Singer and G.L. Nicolson proposed the now widely accepted
**Fluid Mosaic Model** of the structure of cell membranes. The model
proposes that integral membrane proteins are embedded in the
phospholipid bilayer, as seen in **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvSS0wMy0wMi0wMw..) . Some of these proteins
extend all the way through the bilayer, and some only partially across
it. These membrane proteins act as transport proteins and receptors
proteins.

Their model also proposed that the membrane behaves like a fluid, rather
than a solid. The proteins and lipids of the membrane move around the
membrane, much like buoys in water. Such movement causes a constant
change in the "mosaic pattern" of the plasma membrane.

A further description of the Fluid Mosaic Model can be viewed at

#### Extensions of the Plasma Membrane {#3.html#x-ck12-RXh0ZW5zaW9ucyBvZiB0aGUgUGxhc21hIE1lbWJyYW5l_4-fem}

The plasma membrane may have extensions, such as whip-like **flagella**
or brush-like **cilia** . In single-celled organisms, like those shown
in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-Qy1CaW8tMDItMDUtRmxhZ2VsbGEtdnMtY2lsaWE.) , the
membrane extensions may help the organisms move. In multicellular
organisms, the extensions have other functions. For example, the cilia
on human lung cells sweep foreign particles and mucus toward the mouth
and nose.

**Does a cell have, or even need, a "skeleton"?**

What do you get if you take some tubing, and make the tubes smaller and
smaller and smaller? You get very small tubes, or microtubes. Very small
tubes, or microtubules, together with microfilaments, form the basis of
the "skeleton" inside the cell.

### The Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEN5dG9wbGFzbSBhbmQgQ3l0b3NrZWxldG9u_5-5iu}

The **cytoplasm** consists of everything inside the plasma membrane of
the cell, excluding the nucleus in a eukaryotic cell. It includes the
watery, gel-like material called **cytosol** , as well as various
structures. The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two thirds of the
cell’s weight and gives the cell many of its properties.

#### Functions of the Cytoplasm {#3.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIHRoZSBDeXRvcGxhc20._5-3dy}

The cytoplasm has several important functions, including:

1.  suspending cell organelles.
2.  pushing against the plasma membrane to help the cell keep its shape.
3.  providing a site for many of the biochemical reactions of the cell.

#### The Cytoskeleton {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEN5dG9za2VsZXRvbg.._5-3sg}

The **cytoskeleton** is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" that
crisscrosses the cytoplasm. All eukaryotic cells have a cytoskeleton,
and recent research has shown that prokaryotic cells also have a
cytoskeleton. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is made up of a network of
long, thin protein fibers and has many functions. It helps to maintain
cell shape. It holds organelles in place, and for some cells, it enables
cell movement. The cytoskeleton also plays important roles in both the
intracellular movement of substances and in cell division. Certain
proteins act like a path that vesicles and organelles move along within
the cell. The threadlike proteins that make up the cytoskeleton
continually rebuild to adapt to the cell's constantly changing needs.
Three main kinds of cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate
filaments, and microfilaments.

-   **Microtubules** , shown in **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW4z) **(a)** , are hollow cylinders
    and are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures. They are most
    commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta
    tubulin, and radiate outwards from an area near the nucleus called
    the centrosome. **Tubulin** is the protein that forms microtubules.
    Two forms of tubulin, alpha and beta, form dimers (pairs) which come
    together to form the hollow cylinders. The cylinders are twisted
    around each other to form the microtubules. Microtubules help the
    cell keep its shape. They hold organelles in place and allow them to
    move around the cell, and they form the mitotic spindle during
    cell division. Microtubules also make up parts of cilia and
    flagella, the organelles that help a cell move.
-   **Microfilaments** , shown in **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW4z) **(b)** , are made of two thin
    **actin** chains that are twisted around one another. Microfilaments
    are mostly concentrated just beneath the cell membrane, where they
    support the cell and help the cell keep its shape. Microfilaments
    form cytoplasmatic extensions, such as pseudopodia and microvilli,
    which allow certain cells to move. The actin of the microfilaments
    interacts with the protein myosin to cause contraction in
    muscle cells. Microfilaments are found in almost every cell, and are
    numerous in muscle cells and in cells that move by changing shape,
    such as phagocytes (white blood cells that search the body for
    bacteria and other invaders).
-   **Intermediate filaments** differ in make-up from one cell type
    to another. Intermediate filaments organize the inside structure of
    the cell by holding organelles and providing strength. They are also
    structural components of the nuclear envelope. Intermediate
    filaments made of the protein keratin are found in skin, hair, and
    nails cells.

**Where does the DNA live?**

The answer depends on if the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The main
difference between the two types of cells is the presence of a nucleus.
And in eukaryotic cells, DNA lives in the nucleus.

### The Nucleus {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE51Y2xldXM._6-gpn}

The **nucleus** is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in most
eukaryotic cells. The nucleus is the largest organelle in the cell and
contains most of the cell's genetic information (mitochondria also
contain DNA, called mitochondrial DNA, but it makes up just a small
percentage of the cell’s overall DNA content). The genetic information,
which contains the information for the structure and function of the
organism, is found encoded in DNA in the form of genes. A **gene** is a
short segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule
or a protein strand. DNA in the nucleus is organized in long linear
strands that are attached to different proteins. These proteins help the
DNA coil up for better storage in the nucleus. Think how a string gets
tightly coiled up if you twist one end while holding the other end.
These long strands of coiled-up DNA and proteins are called
**chromosomes.** Each chromosome contains many genes. The function of
the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control
the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression. **Gene
expression** is the process by which the information in a gene is
"decoded" by various cell molecules to produce a functional gene
product, such as a protein molecule or an RNA molecule.

The degree of DNA coiling determines whether the chromosome strands are
short and thick or long and thin. Between cell divisions, the DNA in
chromosomes is more loosely coiled and forms long, thin strands called
**chromatin** . Before the cell divides, the chromatin coil up more
tightly and form chromosomes. Only chromosomes stain clearly enough to
be seen under a microscope. The word chromosome comes from the Greek
word *chroma* (color), and *soma* (body), due to its ability to be
stained strongly by dyes.

#### The Nuclear Envelope {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE51Y2xlYXIgRW52ZWxvcGU._6-ncr}

The **nuclear envelope** is a double membrane of the nucleus that
encloses the genetic material. It separates the contents of the nucleus
from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope is made of two lipid bilayers,
an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is
continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called
**nuclear pores** are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores
help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins)
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

#### The Nucleolus {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE51Y2xlb2x1cw.._6-8pm}

The nucleus of many cells also contains a non-membrane bound organelle
called a **nucleolus** , shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvSS0wMy0wMi0wOA..) . The nucleolus is mainly
involved in the assembly of ribosomes. **Ribosomes** are organelles made
of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in
the cytoplasm. The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding
the genetic messages within another type of RNA (called mRNA), into
amino acids. After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported
to the cytoplasm, where they direct protein synthesis.

**Sperm cells and muscle cells need lots of energy. What do they have in
common?**

They have lots of mitochondria. Mitochondria are called the power plants
of the cell, as these organelles are where most of the cell's energy is
produced. Cells that need lots of energy have lots of mitochondria.

### Other Organelles {#3.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgT3JnYW5lbGxlcw.._7-txp}

In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells have many other organelles,
including ribosomes and mitochondria. Ribosomes are present in all
cells.

#### Ribosomes {#3.html#x-ck12-Umlib3NvbWVz_7-lxe}

**Ribosomes** are small organelles and are the sites of protein
synthesis (or assembly). They are made of ribosomal protein and
ribosomal RNA, and are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.
Unlike other organelles, ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane.
Each ribosome has two parts, a large and a small subunit, as shown in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDMtMDItMTE.) . The subunits are
attached to one another. Ribosomes can be found alone or in groups
within the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) (as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDMtMDItMDk.) ), and others are attached to
the nuclear envelope.

**Figure 3.11**

The two subunits that make up a ribosome, small organelles that are
intercellular protein factories.

</div>

**Ribozymes** are RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions, such
as translation. **Translation** is the process of ordering the amino
acids in the assembly of a protein, and translation will be discussed
more in another concept. Briefly, the ribosomes interact with other RNA
molecules to make chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains, due
to the peptide bond that forms between individual amino acids.
Polypeptide chains are built from the genetic instructions held within a
messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. Polypeptide chains that are made on the
rough ER (discussed below) are inserted directly into the ER and then
are transported to their various cellular destinations. Ribosomes on the
rough ER usually produce proteins that are destined for the cell
membrane.

Ribosomes are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Ribosomes
are not surrounded by a membrane. The other organelles found in
eukaryotic cells are surrounded by a membrane.

#### Mitochondria {#3.html#x-ck12-TWl0b2Nob25kcmlh_7-ow3}

A mitochondrion ( **mitochondria** , plural), is a membrane-enclosed
organelle that is found in most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are
called the "power plants" of the cell because they are the sites of
cellular respiration, where they use energy from organic compounds to
make ATP (adenosine triphosphate). **ATP** is the cell's energy source
that is used for such things such as movement and cell division. Some
ATP is made in the cytosol of the cell, but most of it is made inside
mitochondria. The number of mitochondria in a cell depends on the cell’s
energy needs. For example, active human muscle cells may have thousands
of mitochondria, while less active red blood cells do not have any.

</div>

As **Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDMtMDItMDk.) **(a)** and
**(b)** show, a mitochondrion has two phospholipid membranes. The smooth
outer membrane separates the mitochondrion from the cytosol. The inner
membrane has many folds, called **cristae** . The fluid-filled inside of
the mitochondrion, called **matrix** , is where most of the cell’s ATP
is made.

Although most of a cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus,
mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondria are able to reproduce
asexually, and scientists think that they are descended from
prokaryotes. According to the endosymbiotic theory, mitochondria were
once free-living prokaryotes that infected or were engulfed by ancient
eukaryotic cells. The invading prokaryotes were protected inside the
eukaryotic host cell, and in turn the prokaryote supplied extra ATP to
its host.

**Does a cell have its own ER?**

Yes, but in this case, the ER is not just for emergencies. True, there
might be times when the cell responds to emergency conditions and the
functions of the ER may be needed, but usually the cell's ER is involved
in normal functions. Proteins are also made on the outside of the ER,
and this starts a whole process of protein transport, both around the
inside of the cell and to the cell membrane and out.

### Other Organelles {#3.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgT3JnYW5lbGxlcw.._8-gks}

In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells have many other organelles,
including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles,
vacuoles, and centrioles.

#### Endoplasmic Reticulum {#3.html#x-ck12-RW5kb3BsYXNtaWMgUmV0aWN1bHVt_8-itx}

The **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** (plural, reticuli) is a network of
phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, flattened sheets, and
round sacs. These flattened, hollow folds and sacs are called cisternae.
The ER has two major functions:

-   Transport: Molecules, such as proteins, can move from place to place
    inside the ER, much like on an intracellular highway.
-   Synthesis: Ribosomes that are attached to ER, similar to unattached
    ribosomes, make proteins. Lipids are also produced in the ER.

There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic
reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).

-   **Rough endoplasmic reticulum** is studded with ribosomes, which
    gives it a "rough" appearance. These ribosomes make proteins that
    are then transported from the ER in small sacs called
    transport vesicles. The transport vesicles pinch off the ends of
    the ER. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works with the Golgi
    apparatus to move new proteins to their proper destinations in
    the cell. The membrane of the RER is continuous with the outer layer
    of the nuclear envelope.
-   **Smooth endoplasmic reticulum** does not have any ribosomes
    attached to it, and so it has a smooth appearance. SER has many
    different functions, some of which include lipid synthesis, calcium
    ion storage, and drug detoxification. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
    is found in both animal and plant cells and it serves different
    functions in each. The SER is made up of tubules and vesicles that
    branch out to form a network. In some cells there are dilated areas
    like the sacs of RER. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum and RER form an
    interconnected network.

![Nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi
apparatus](ck12_3_files/20150914104100504764.png "Nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus")

**Figure 3.13**

Image of nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and how
they work together. The process of secretion from endoplasmic reticuli
to Golgi apparatus is shown.

</div>

#### Golgi Apparatus {#3.html#x-ck12-R29sZ2kgQXBwYXJhdHVz_8-ejn}

The **Golgi apparatus** is a large organelle that is usually made up of
five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae, as
shown in **Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTAzR29sZ2k.) . The
cisternae look a bit like a stack of deflated balloons. The Golgi
apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for
secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. The Golgi
apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies
proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER. It
is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell. Pieces of
the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules
around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a
post office; it packages and labels "items" and then sends them to
different parts of the cell. Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi
apparatus. Plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks
scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In plants, the Golgi apparatus
contains enzymes that synthesize some of the cell wall polysaccharides.

#### Vesicles {#3.html#x-ck12-VmVzaWNsZXM._8-ahi}

A **vesicle** is a small, spherical compartment that is separated from
the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer. Many vesicles are made in the
Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of
the cell membrane. Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in
**Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTAzR29sZ2k.) . Because it is
separated from the cytosol, the space inside the vesicle can be made to
be chemically different from the cytosol. Vesicles are basic tools of
the cell for organizing metabolism, transport, and storage of molecules.
Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers. They can be
classified by their contents and function.

-   **Transport vesicles** are able to move molecules between locations
    inside the cell. For example, transport vesicles move proteins from
    the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
-   **Lysosomes** are vesicles that are formed by the Golgi apparatus.
    They contain powerful enzymes that could break down (digest)
    the cell. Lysosomes break down harmful cell products, waste
    materials, and cellular debris and then force them out of the cell.
    They also digest invading organisms such as bacteria. Lysosomes also
    break down cells that are ready to die, a process called autolysis.
-   **Peroxisomes** are vesicles that use oxygen to break down toxic
    substances in the cell. Unlike lysosomes, which are formed by the
    Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes self-replicate by growing bigger and
    then dividing. They are common in liver and kidney cells that break
    down harmful substances. Peroxisomes are named for the hydrogen
    peroxide (H ~2~ O ~2~ ) that is produced when they break down
    organic compounds. Hydrogen peroxide is toxic, and in turn is broken
    down into water (H ~2~ O) and oxygen (O ~2~ ) molecules.

#### Vacuoles {#3.html#x-ck12-VmFjdW9sZXM._8-6c1}

**Vacuoles** are membrane-bound organelles that can have secretory,
excretory, and storage functions. Many organisms will use vacuoles as
storage areas and some plant cells have very large vacuoles. Vesicles
are much smaller than vacuoles and function in transporting materials
both within and to the outside of the cell.

#### Centrioles {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VudHJpb2xlcw.._8-qrt}

**Centrioles** are rod-like structures made of short microtubules. Nine
groups of three microtubules make up each centriole. Two perpendicular
centrioles make up the **centrosome** . Centrioles are very important in
cellular division, where they arrange the mitotic spindles that pull the
chromosome apart during mitosis.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-4id}

-   The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the synthesis of
    lipids and synthesis and transport of proteins.
-   The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different
    substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within
    the cell.
-   Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers. Transport
    vesicles, lysosomes, and peroxisomes are types of vesicles.

**What do plants have to do that animals don't?**

Many plant cells are green. Why? Plant cells also usually have a
distinct shape. The rigid exterior around the cells is necessary to
allow the plants to grow upright. Animal cells do not have these rigid
exteriors. There are other distinct differences between plant and animal
cells. These will be the focus of this concept.

### Plant Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgQ2VsbHM._9-zlz}

#### Special Structures in Plant Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-U3BlY2lhbCBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVzIGluIFBsYW50IENlbGxz_9-rxd}

Most organelles are common to both animal and plant cells. However,
plant cells also have features that animal cells do not have: a cell
wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts.

Plants have very different lifestyles from animals, and these
differences are apparent when you examine the structure of the plant
cell. Plants make their own food in a process called **photosynthesis**
. They take in carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and water (H ~2~ O) and convert
them into sugars. The features unique to plant cells can be seen in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvSS0wMy0wMi0xMg..) .

![Organelles in a plant
cell](ck12_3_files/20150914104100888312.jpeg "Organelles in a plant cell")

**Figure 3.14**

In addition to containing most of the organelles found in animal cells,
plant cells also have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and
plastids. These three features are not found in animal cells.

</div>

#### The Cell Wall {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbGwgV2FsbA.._9-sjb}

A **cell wall** is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane
and surrounds the cell. The cell wall contains not only cellulose and
protein, but other polysaccharides as well. The cell wall provides
structural support and protection. Pores in the cell wall allow water
and nutrients to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall also
prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell.

Microtubules guide the formation of the plant cell wall. Cellulose is
laid down by enzymes to form the primary cell wall. Some plants also
have a secondary cell wall. The secondary wall contains a lignin, a
secondary cell component in plant cells that have completed cell
growth/expansion.

#### The Central Vacuole {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbnRyYWwgVmFjdW9sZQ.._9-mns}

Most mature plant cells have a **central vacuole** that occupies more
than 30% of the cell's volume. The central vacuole can occupy as much as
90% of the volume of certain cells. The central vacuole is surrounded by
a membrane called the **tonoplast** . The central vacuole has many
functions. Aside from storage, the main role of the vacuole is to
maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the
tonoplast control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole. The
central vacuole also stores the pigments that color flowers.

The central vacuole contains large amounts of a liquid called cell sap,
which differs in composition to the cell cytosol. Cell sap is a mixture
of water, enzymes, ions, salts, and other substances. Cell sap may also
contain toxic byproducts that have been removed from the cytosol. Toxins
in the vacuole may help to protect some plants from being eaten.

#### Plastids {#3.html#x-ck12-UGxhc3RpZHM._9-ozv}

Plant **plastids** are a group of closely related membrane-bound
organelles that carry out many functions. They are responsible for
photosynthesis, for storage of products such as starch, and for the
synthesis of many types of molecules that are needed as cellular
building blocks. Plastids have the ability to change their function
between these and other forms. Plastids contain their own DNA and some
ribosomes, and scientists think that plastids are descended from
photosynthetic bacteria that allowed the first eukaryotes to make
oxygen. The main types of plastids and their functions are:

-   **Chloroplasts** are the organelle of photosynthesis. They capture

#### Chloroplasts {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hsb3JvcGxhc3Rz_9-dd5}

**Chloroplasts** capture light energy from the sun and use it with water
and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food. Chloroplasts look like
flat discs and are usually 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter and 1
micrometer thick. A model of a chloroplast is shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW44) . The chloroplast is enclosed by an
inner and an outer phospholipid membrane. Between these two layers is
the intermembrane space. The fluid within the chloroplast is called the
**stroma** , and it contains one or more molecules of small, circular
DNA. The stroma also has ribosomes. Within the stroma are stacks of
**thylakoids** , sub-organelles that are the site of photosynthesis. The
thylakoids are arranged in stacks called **grana** (singular: granum). A
thylakoid has a flattened disk shape. Inside it is an empty area called
the thylakoid space or lumen. Photosynthesis takes place on the
thylakoid membrane.

Within the thylakoid membrane is the complex of proteins and
light-absorbing pigments, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids. This
complex allows capture of light energy from many wavelengths because
chlorophyll and carotenoids both absorb different wavelengths of light.
These will be further discussed in the "Photosynthesis" concept.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-til}

-   Plant cells have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids
    such as chloroplasts.
-   The cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell
    membrane and surrounds the cell, providing structural support
    and protection.
-   The central vacuole maintains turgor pressure against the cell wall.
-   Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and use it with water
    and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food.

**Why be organized?**

It can be said organization leads to efficiency. And in you, cells are
organized into tissues, which are organized into organs, which are
organized into organ systems, which form you. And it can be said that
the human body is a very organized and efficient system.

### Organization of Cells {#3.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5pemF0aW9uIG9mIENlbGxz_10-sei}

Biological organization exists at all levels in organisms. It can be
seen at the smallest level, in the molecules that made up such things as
DNA and proteins, to the largest level, in an organism such as a blue
whale, the largest mammal on Earth. Similarly, single celled prokaryotes
and eukaryotes show order in the way their cells are arranged.
Single-celled organisms such as an amoeba are free-floating and
independent-living. Their single-celled "bodies" are able to carry out
all the processes of life, such as metabolism and respiration, without
help from other cells. Some single-celled organisms, such as bacteria,
can group together and form a biofilm. A **biofilm** is a large grouping
of many bacteria that sticks to a surface and makes a protective coating
over itself. Biofilms can show similarities to multicellular organisms.
Division of labor is the process in which one group of cells does one
job (such as making the "glue" that sticks the biofilm to the surface),
while another group of cells does another job (such as taking in
nutrients). Multicellular organisms carry out their life processes
through division of labor. They have specialized cells that do specific
jobs. However, biofilms are not considered multicellular organisms and
are instead called colonial organisms. The difference between a
multicellular organism and a colonial organism is that individual
organisms from a colony or biofilm can, if separated, survive on their
own, while cells from a multicellular organism (e.g., liver cells)
cannot.

colony](ck12_3_files/20150914104101871582.jpeg "Volvox algae colony")

**Figure 3.17**

Colonial algae of the genus *Volvox* .

</div>

#### Colonial Organisms {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29sb25pYWwgT3JnYW5pc21z_10-hr0}

**Colonial organisms** were probably one of the first evolutionary steps
towards multicellular organisms. Algae of the genus *Volvox* are an
example of the border between colonial organisms and multicellular
organisms.

Each *Volvox* , shown in **Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW45)
, is a colonial organism. It is made up of between 1,000 to 3,000
photosynthetic algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere. The
sphere has a distinct front and back end. The cells have eyespots, which
are more developed in the cells near the front. This enables the colony
to swim towards light.

#### Origin of Multicellularity {#3.html#x-ck12-T3JpZ2luIG9mIE11bHRpY2VsbHVsYXJpdHk._10-e41}

The oldest known multicellular organism is a red algae *Bangiomorpha
pubescens* , fossils of which were found in 1.2 billion-year-old rock.
As the first organisms were single-celled, these organisms had to evolve
into multicellular organisms.

Scientists think that multicellularity arose from cooperation between
many organisms of the same species. The **Colonial Theory** proposes
that this cooperation led to the development of a multicellular
organism. Many examples of cooperation between organisms in nature have
been observed. For example, a certain species of amoeba (a single-celled
protist) groups together during times of food shortage and forms a
colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoebas then
become slightly differentiated from each other. *Volvox* , shown in
**Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW45) , is another example of
a colonial organism. Most scientists accept that the Colonial Theory
explains how multicellular organisms evolved.

**Multicellular organisms** are organisms that are made up of more than
one type of cell and have specialized cells that are grouped together to
carry out specialized functions. Most life that you can see without a
microscope is multicellular. As discussed earlier, the cells of a
multicellular organism would not survive as independent cells. The body
of a multicellular organism, such as a tree or a cat, exhibits
organization at several levels: tissues, organs, and organ systems.
Similar cells are grouped into tissues, groups of tissues make up
organs, and organs with a similar function are grouped into an organ
system.

#### Levels of Organization in Multicellular Organisms {#3.html#x-ck12-TGV2ZWxzIG9mIE9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbiBpbiBNdWx0aWNlbGx1bGFyIE9yZ2FuaXNtcw.._10-b64}

The simplest living multicellular organisms, sponges, are made of many
specialized types of cells that work together for a common goal. Such
cell types include digestive cells, tubular pore cells, and epidermal
cells. Though the different cell types create a large, organized,
multicellular structure — the visible sponge — they are not organized
into true interconnected tissues. If a sponge is broken up by passing it
through a sieve, the sponge will reform on the other side. However, if
the sponge’s cells are separated from each other, the individual cell
types cannot survive alone. Simpler colonial organisms, such as members
of the genus *Volvox* , as shown in **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW45) , differ in that their individual
cells are free-living and can survive on their own if separated from the
colony.

**Figure 3.18**

This roundworm, a multicellular organism, was stained to highlight the
nuclei of all the cells in its body (red dots).

</div>

A **tissue** is a group of connected cells that have a similar function
within an organism. More complex organisms such as jellyfish, coral, and
sea anemones have a tissue level of organization. For example, jellyfish
have tissues that have separate protective, digestive, and sensory
functions.

Even more complex organisms, such as the roundworm shown in **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMy0yLW4xMA..) , while also having
differentiated cells and tissues, have an organ level of development. An
**organ** is a group of tissues that has a specific function or group of
functions. Organs can be as primitive as the brain of a flatworm (a
group of nerve cells), as large as the stem of a sequoia (up to 90
meters, or 300 feet, in height), or as complex as a human liver.

The most complex organisms (such as mammals, trees, and flowers) have
organ systems. An **organ system** is a group of organs that act
together to carry out complex related functions, with each organ
focusing on a part of the task. An example is the human digestive
system, in which the mouth ingests food, the stomach crushes and
liquifies it, the pancreas and gall bladder make and release digestive
enzymes, and the intestines absorb nutrients into the blood.

**What will eventually happen to these dyes?**

They will all blend together. The dyes will move through the water until
an even distribution is achieved. The process of moving from areas of
high amounts to areas of low amounts is called diffusion.

### Passive Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-UGFzc2l2ZSBUcmFuc3BvcnQ._11-cso}

Probably the most important feature of a cell’s phospholipid membranes
is that they are **selectively permeable** or **semipermeable** . A
membrane that is selectively permeable has control over what molecules
or ions can enter or leave the cell, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMzMtMDFh) . The permeability of a membrane is
dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids
and proteins. In this way, cell membranes help maintain a state of
homeostasis within cells (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so
that an organism can stay alive and healthy.

</div>

#### Transport Across Membranes {#3.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNwb3J0IEFjcm9zcyBNZW1icmFuZXM._11-yor}

The molecular make-up of the phospholipid bilayer limits the types of
molecules that can pass through it. For example, **hydrophobic**
(water-hating) molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) and oxygen (O
~2~ ), can easily pass through the lipid bilayer, but ions such as
calcium (Ca ^2+^ ) and polar molecules such as water (H ~2~ O) cannot.
The hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer does not allow ions
or polar molecules through because these molecules are **hydrophilic** ,
or water loving. In addition, large molecules such as sugars and
proteins are too big to pass through the bilayer. Transport proteins
within the membrane allow these molecules to pass through the membrane,
and into or out of the cell. This way, polar molecules avoid contact
with the nonpolar interior of the membrane, and large molecules are
moved through large pores.

Every cell is contained within a membrane punctuated with transport
proteins that act as channels or pumps to let in or force out certain
molecules. The purpose of the transport proteins is to protect the
cell's internal environment and to keep its balance of salts, nutrients,
and proteins within a range that keeps the cell and the organism alive.

There are three main ways that molecules can pass through a phospholipid
membrane. The first way requires no energy input by the cell and is
called passive transport. The second way requires that the cell uses
energy to pull in or pump out certain molecules and ions and is called
active transport. The third way is through vesicle transport, in which
large molecules are moved across the membrane in bubble-like sacks that
are made from pieces of the membrane.

**Passive transport** is a way that small molecules or ions move across
the cell membrane without input of energy by the cell. The three main
kinds of passive transport are diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated
diffusion.

#### Diffusion {#3.html#x-ck12-RGlmZnVzaW9u_11-jlv}

**Diffusion** is the movement of molecules from an area of high
concentration of the molecules to an area with a lower concentration.
The difference in the concentrations of the molecules in the two areas
is called the **concentration gradient** . Diffusion will continue until
this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from
an area of higher concentration to the lower, it is described as moving
solutes "down the concentration gradient." The end result of diffusion
is an equal concentration, or **equilibrium** , of molecules on both
sides of the membrane.

If a molecule can pass freely through a cell membrane, it will cross the
membrane by diffusion ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDMtMTdh)
).

**Saltwater Fish vs. Freshwater Fish?**

Fish cells, like all cells, have semi-permeable membranes. Eventually,
the concentration of "stuff" on either side of them will even out. A
fish that lives in salt water will have somewhat salty water inside
itself. Put it in the freshwater, and the freshwater will, through
osmosis, enter the fish, causing its cells to swell, and the fish will
die. What will happen to a freshwater fish in the ocean?

### Osmosis {#3.html#x-ck12-T3Ntb3Npcw.._12-lv0}

Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g of table
sugar to the water. The sugar dissolves and the mixture that is now in
the cup is made up of a **solute** (the sugar) that is dissolved in the
**solvent** (the water). The mixture of a solute in a solvent is called
a **solution** .

Imagine now that you have a second cup with 100ml of water, and you add
45 grams of table sugar to the water. Just like the first cup, the sugar
is the solute, and the water is the solvent. But now you have two
mixtures of different solute concentrations. In comparing two solutions
of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the higher solute
concentration is **hypertonic** , and the solution with the lower solute
concentration is **hypotonic** . Solutions of equal solute concentration
are **isotonic** . The first sugar solution is hypotonic to the second
solution. The second sugar solution is hypertonic to the first.

You now add the two solutions to a beaker that has been divided by a
selectively permeable membrane, with pores that are too small for the
sugar molecules to pass through, but are big enough for the water
molecules to pass through. The hypertonic solution is on one side of the
membrane and the hypotonic solution on the other. The hypertonic
solution has a lower water concentration than the hypotonic solution, so
a concentration gradient of water now exists across the membrane. Water
molecules will move from the side of higher water concentration to the
side of lower concentration until both solutions are isotonic. At this
point, **equilibrium** is reached.

**Osmosis** is the diffusion of water molecules across a selectively
permeable membrane from an area of higher concentration to an area of
lower concentration. Water moves into and out of cells by osmosis. If a
cell is in a hypertonic solution, the solution has a lower water
concentration than the cell cytosol, and water moves out of the cell
until both solutions are isotonic. Cells placed in a hypotonic solution
will take in water across their membrane until both the external
solution and the cytosol are isotonic.

A cell that does not have a rigid cell wall, such as a red blood cell,
will swell and lyse (burst) when placed in a hypotonic solution. Cells
with a cell wall will swell when placed in a hypotonic solution, but
once the cell is turgid (firm), the tough cell wall prevents any more
water from entering the cell. When placed in a hypertonic solution, a
cell without a cell wall will lose water to the environment, shrivel,
and probably die. In a hypertonic solution, a cell with a cell wall will
lose water too. The plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall as it
shrivels, a process called **plasmolysis** . Animal cells tend to do

**Figure 3.21**

Unless an animal cell (such as the red blood cell in the top panel) has
an adaptation that allows it to alter the osmotic uptake of water, it
will lose too much water and shrivel up in a hypertonic environment. If
placed in a hypotonic solution, water molecules will enter the cell,
causing it to swell and burst. Plant cells (bottom panel) become
plasmolyzed in a hypertonic solution, but tend to do best in a hypotonic
environment. Water is stored in the central vacuole of the plant cell.

</div>

#### Osmotic Pressure {#3.html#x-ck12-T3Ntb3RpYyBQcmVzc3VyZQ.._12-4br}

When water moves into a cell by osmosis, osmotic pressure may build up
inside the cell. If a cell has a cell wall, the wall helps maintain the
cell’s water balance. **Osmotic pressure** is the main cause of support
in many plants. When a plant cell is in a hypotonic environment, the
osmotic entry of water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the
cell wall until the pressure prevents more water from coming into the
cell. At this point the plant cell is turgid ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDMtMDMtMDQ.) ). The effects of osmotic
pressures on plant cells are shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDMtMDMtMDQ.) .

The action of osmosis can be very harmful to organisms, especially ones
without cell walls. For example, if a saltwater fish (whose cells are
isotonic with seawater), is placed in fresh water, its cells will take
on excess water, lyse, and the fish will die. Another example of a
harmful osmotic effect is the use of table salt to kill slugs and
snails.

#### Controlling Osmosis {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbGxpbmcgT3Ntb3Npcw.._12-wzk}

Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need
a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis. A
**contractile vacuole** is a type of vacuole that removes excess water
from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecium shown in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMzMtMDVi) , have a contractile
vacuole. The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water
by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the
water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it pushes
the water out of the cell through a pore.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-6zk}

-   Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
-   In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the
    solution with the higher solute concentration is hypertonic, and the
    solution with the lower concentration is hypotonic. Solutions of
    equal solute concentration are isotonic.

**Can you help me move?**

What is one of the questions no one likes to be asked? Sometimes the
cell needs help moving things as well, or facilitating the diffusion
process. And this would be the job of a special type of protein.

### Facilitated Diffusion {#3.html#x-ck12-RmFjaWxpdGF0ZWQgRGlmZnVzaW9u_13-qsf}

What happens if a substance needs assistance to move across or through
the plasma membrane? **Facilitated diffusion** is the diffusion of
solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane. Facilitated
diffusion is a type of passive transport. Even though facilitated
diffusion involves transport proteins, it is still passive transport
because the solute is moving down the concentration gradient.

Small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane.
However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipids that make up cell
membranes, polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot do so.
Instead, they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins. A
**transport protein** completely spans the membrane, and allows certain
molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane. Channel proteins,
gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of
transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.

A **channel protein** , a type of transport protein, acts like a pore in
the membrane that lets water molecules or small ions through quickly.
Water channel proteins (aquaporins) allow water to diffuse across the
membrane at a very fast rate. Ion channel proteins allow ions to diffuse
across the membrane.

A **gated channel protein** is a transport protein that opens a "gate,"
allowing a molecule to pass through the membrane. Gated channels have a
binding site that is specific for a given molecule or ion. A stimulus
causes the "gate" to open or shut. The stimulus may be chemical or
electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force, depending on the
type of gated channel. For example, the sodium gated channels of a nerve
cell are stimulated by a chemical signal which causes them to open and
allow sodium ions into the cell. Glucose molecules are too big to
diffuse through the plasma membrane easily, so they are moved across the
membrane through gated channels. In this way glucose diffuses very
quickly across a cell membrane, which is important because many cells
depend on glucose for energy.

A **carrier protein** is a transport protein that is specific for an
ion, molecule, or group of substances. Carrier proteins "carry" the ion
or molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the binding of
the ion or molecule. Carrier proteins are involved in passive and active
transport. A model of a channel protein and carrier proteins is shown in
**Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTE4LUZhY2lsaXRhdGVkLURpZmZ1c2lvbg..) .

carrier proteins are shown (but not a gated-channel protein). Water
molecules and ions move through channel proteins. Other ions or
molecules are also carried across the cell membrane by carrier proteins.
The ion or molecule binds to the active site of a carrier protein. The
carrier protein changes shape, and releases the ion or molecule on the
other side of the membrane. The carrier protein then returns to its
original shape.

#### Ion Channels {#3.html#x-ck12-SW9uIENoYW5uZWxz_13-jok}

Ions such as sodium (Na ^+^ ), potassium (K ^+^ ), calcium (Ca ^2+^ ),
and chloride (Cl ^-^ ), are important for many cell functions. Because
they are charged (polar), these ions do not diffuse through the
membrane. Instead they move through ion channel proteins where they are
protected from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. **Ion
channels** allow the formation of a concentration gradient between the
extracellular fluid and the cytosol. Ion channels are very specific, as
they allow only certain ions through the cell membrane. Some ion
channels are always open, others are "gated" and can be opened or
closed. Gated ion channels can open or close in response to different
types of stimuli, such as electrical or chemical signals.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-rav}

-   Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through transport
    proteins in the plasma membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel
    proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins
    that are involved in facilitated diffusion.

**Need to move something really heavy?**

If you did, it would take a lot of energy. Sometimes, moving things into
or out of the cell also takes energy. How would the cell move something
against a concentration gradient? It starts by using energy.

### Active Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-QWN0aXZlIFRyYW5zcG9ydA.._14-fek}

In contrast to facilitated diffusion, which does not require energy and
carries molecules or ions down a **concentration gradient** , active
transport pumps molecules and ions against a concentration gradient.
Sometimes an organism needs to transport something against a
concentration gradient. The only way this can be done is through active
transport, which uses energy that is produced by respiration (ATP). In
active transport, the particles move across a cell membrane from a lower
concentration to a higher concentration. **Active transport** is the
energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes
"uphill" - against a concentration gradient.

-   The active transport of small molecules or ions across a cell
    membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins that are
    found in the membrane.
-   Larger molecules such as starch can also be actively transported
    across the cell membrane by processes called endocytosis
    and exocytosis.

#### Homeostasis and Cell Function {#3.html#x-ck12-SG9tZW9zdGFzaXMgYW5kIENlbGwgRnVuY3Rpb24._14-wis}

**Homeostasis** refers to the balance, or equilibrium, within the cell
or a body. It is an organism’s ability to keep a constant internal
environment. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant
adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The
adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation.
Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly
changing, adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the
set point (the normal level or range). Homeostasis is a dynamic
equilibrium rather than an unchanging state. The cellular processes
discussed in both the *Diffusion* and *Active Transport* concepts all
play an important role in homeostatic regulation. You will learn more
about homeostasis in other concepts.

    molecules and ions across membranes against a
    concentration gradient.

**What is this incredible object?**

Would it surprise you to learn that it is a human cell? The image
represents an active human nerve cell. How nerve cells function will be
the focus of another concept. However, active transport processes play a
significant role in the function of these cells. Specifically, it is the
sodium-potassium pump that is active in the axons of these nerve cells.

### The Sodium-Potassium Pump {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNvZGl1bS1Qb3Rhc3NpdW0gUHVtcA.._15-gty}

**Active transport** is the energy-requiring process of pumping
molecules and ions across membranes "uphill" - against a concentration
gradient. To move these molecules against their concentration gradient,
a carrier protein is needed. Carrier proteins can work with a
concentration gradient (during passive transport), but some carrier
proteins can move solutes against the concentration gradient (from low
concentration to high concentration), with an input of energy. In active
transport, as carrier proteins are used to move materials against their
concentration gradient, these proteins are known as pumps. As in other
types of cellular activities, ATP supplies the energy for most active
transport. One way ATP powers active transport is by transferring a
phosphate group directly to a carrier protein. This may cause the
carrier protein to change its shape, which moves the molecule or ion to
the other side of the membrane. An example of this type of active
transport system, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTAzLTA3) , is the **sodium-potassium
pump,** which exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions across the plasma
membrane of animal cells.

![How a sodium-potassium pump
work](ck12_3_files/20150914104104820389.jpeg "How a sodium-potassium pump work")

**Figure 3.25**

The sodium-potassium pump system moves sodium and potassium ions against
large concentration gradients. It moves two potassium ions into the cell
where potassium levels are high, and pumps three sodium ions out of the
cell and into the extracellular fluid.

</div>

As is shown in **Figure** [above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTAzLTAzLTA3) ,
three sodium ions bind with the protein pump inside the cell. The
carrier protein then gets energy from ATP and changes shape. In doing
so, it pumps the three sodium ions out of the cell. At that point, two
potassium ions from outside the cell bind to the protein pump. The
potassium ions are then transported into the cell, and the process
repeats. The sodium-potassium pump is found in the plasma membrane of
almost every human cell and is common to all cellular life. It helps
maintain cell potential and regulates cellular volume.

A more detailed look at the sodium-potassium pump is available at

#### The Electrochemical Gradient {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVsZWN0cm9jaGVtaWNhbCBHcmFkaWVudA.._15-gal}

The active transport of ions across the membrane causes an electrical
gradient to build up across the plasma membrane. The number of
positively charged ions outside the cell is greater than the number of
positively charged ions in the cytosol. This results in a relatively
negative charge on the inside of the membrane, and a positive charge on
the outside. This difference in charges causes a voltage across the
membrane. Voltage is electrical potential energy that is caused by a
separation of opposite charges, in this case across the membrane. The
voltage across a membrane is called **membrane potential** . Membrane
potential is very important for the conduction of electrical impulses
along nerve cells.

Because the inside of the cell is negative compared to outside the cell,
the membrane potential favors the movement of positively charged ions
(cations) into the cell, and the movement of negative ions (anions) out
of the cell. So, there are two forces that drive the diffusion of ions
across the plasma membrane—a chemical force (the ions' concentration
gradient), and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential
on the ions’ movement). These two forces working together are called an
**electrochemical gradient** , and will be discussed in detail in "Nerve
Cells" and "Nerve Impulses" concepts.

**What does a cell "eat"?**

Is it possible for objects larger than a small molecule to be engulfed
by a cell? Of course it is. This image depicts a cancer cell being
attacked by a cell of the immune system. Cells of the immune system
consistently destroy pathogens by essentially "eating" them.

### Vesicle Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-VmVzaWNsZSBUcmFuc3BvcnQ._16-aze}

Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the
plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein. So cells use two
other active transport processes to move these macromolecules (large
molecules) into or out of the cell. Vesicles or other bodies in the
cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma
membrane. There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and
exocytosis (illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-VmVzaWN1bGFyVHJhbnNwb3J0) ). Both processes are

### Endocytosis and Exocytosis {#3.html#x-ck12-RW5kb2N5dG9zaXMgYW5kIEV4b2N5dG9zaXM._16-s6t}

**Endocytosis** is the process of capturing a substance or particle from
outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane. The membrane
folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the
membrane. At this point a membrane-bound sac, or vesicle, pinches off
and moves the substance into the cytosol. There are two main kinds of
endocytosis:

-   **Phagocytosis** , or *cellular eating,* occurs when the dissolved
    materials enter the cell. The plasma membrane engulfs the solid
    material, forming a phagocytic vesicle.
-   **Pinocytosis** , or *cellular drinking,* occurs when the plasma
    membrane folds inward to form a channel allowing dissolved
    substances to enter the cell, as shown in **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMzMtMDhh) . When the channel is closed,
    the liquid is encircled within a pinocytic vesicle.

**Exocytosis** describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma
membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as
shown in **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-RXhvY3l0b3Npcw..) .
Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a
protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin.
Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the
plasma membrane by exocytosis. For a detailed animation of cellular
secretion, see

**Name one major difference between a plant and an animal.**

There are many differences, but in terms of energy, it all starts with
sunlight. Plants absorb the energy from the sun and turn it into *food.*
You can sit in the sun for hours and hours. You will feel warm, but
you're not going to absorb any energy. You have to eat to obtain your
energy.

### Autotrophs vs. Heterotrophs {#3.html#x-ck12-QXV0b3Ryb3BocyB2cy4gSGV0ZXJvdHJvcGhz_17-scl}

Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways.

**Autotrophs,** shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTAxLVBob3Rvc3ludGhldGljLUF1dG90cm9waA..)
, store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they build
themselves. **Food** is chemical energy stored in organic molecules.
Food provides both the energy to do work and the carbon to build bodies.
Because most autotrophs transform sunlight to make food, we call the
process they use **photosynthesis** . Only three groups of organisms -
plants, algae, and some bacteria - are capable of this life-giving
energy transformation. Autotrophs make food for their own use, but they
make enough to support other life as well. Almost all other organisms
depend absolutely on these three groups for the food they produce. The
**producers** , as autotrophs are also known, begin **food chains**
which feed all life. Food chains will be discussed in the "Food Chains
and Food Webs" concept.

**Heterotrophs** cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb
it. For this reason, heterotrophs are also known as **consumers** .
Consumers include all animals and fungi and many protists and bacteria.
They may consume autotrophs or other heterotrophs or organic molecules
from other organisms. Heterotrophs show great diversity and may appear
far more fascinating than producers. But heterotrophs are limited by our
utter dependence on those autotrophs that originally made our food. If
plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria vanished from earth, animals,
fungi, and other heterotrophs would soon disappear as well. All life
requires a constant input of energy. Only autotrophs can transform that
ultimate, solar source into the chemical energy in food that powers
life, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTAyLUxvSA..) .

![Examples of photosynthetic
autotrophs](ck12_3_files/20150914104106073124.png "Examples of photosynthetic autotrophs")

**Figure 3.29**

Photosynthetic autotrophs, which make food using the energy in sunlight,
include (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) certain bacteria.

</div>

Photosynthesis provides over 99 percent of the energy for life on earth.
A much smaller group of autotrophs - mostly bacteria in dark or
low-oxygen environments - produce food using the chemical energy stored
in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane.
While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this
alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic
to organic molecules. It is therefore called **chemosynthesis** , and is
characteristic of the tubeworms shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvNC0xLW4y) . Some of the most recently
discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or
“black smokers.” There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth’s
interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant
tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some
scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface
of Mars, Jupiter's moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems
based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too
illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for
food.

of the food chain? (see the "Flow of Energy" concept.)

#### Making and Using Food {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFraW5nIGFuZCBVc2luZyBGb29k_17-in8}

The flow of energy through living organisms begins with photosynthesis.
This process stores energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of
glucose. By breaking the chemical bonds in glucose, cells release the
stored energy and make the ATP they need. The process in which glucose
is broken down and ATP is made is called **cellular respiration** .

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are like two sides of the same
coin. This is apparent from **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-UmVzcGlyYXRpb24tcGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXMtMDE.) . The
products of one process are the reactants of the other. Together, the
two processes store and release energy in living organisms. The two
processes also work together to recycle oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.

respiration. It also shows how the two processes are related.

</div>

##### Photosynthesis {#3.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXM._17-mar}

Photosynthesis is often considered to be the single most important life
process on Earth. It changes light energy into chemical energy and also
releases oxygen. Without photosynthesis, there would be no oxygen in the
atmosphere. Photosynthesis involves many chemical reactions, but they
can be summed up in a single chemical equation:

6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Light Energy → C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ .

Photosynthetic autotrophs capture light energy from the sun and absorb
carbon dioxide and water from their environment. Using the light energy,
they combine the reactants to produce glucose and oxygen, which is a
waste product. They store the glucose, usually as starch, and they
release the oxygen into the atmosphere.

##### Cellular Respiration {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24._17-qau}

Cellular respiration actually “burns” glucose for energy. However, it
doesn’t produce light or intense heat as some other types of burning do.
This is because it releases the energy in glucose slowly, in many small
steps. It uses the energy that is released to form molecules of ATP.
Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions, which can be
summed up with this chemical equation:

C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ → 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Chemical Energy (in
ATP)

Cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all living things. It takes
place in the cells of both autotrophs and heterotrophs. All of them burn
glucose to form ATP.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-rdo}

-   Autotrophs store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they
    build themselves. Most autotrophs make their "food" through
    photosynthesis using the energy of the sun.
-   Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or
    absorb it.
-   Chemosynthesis is used to produce food using the chemical energy
    stored in inorganic molecules.

**Needs lots of energy?**

To run a marathon, probably. Where does this extra energy come from?
Carbohydrate loading is a strategy used by endurance athletes to
maximize the storage of energy, in the form of glycogen, in the muscles.
Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a
sudden need for glucose, which is then turned into ATP through the
process of cellular respiration.

### Glucose and ATP {#3.html#x-ck12-R2x1Y29zZSBhbmQgQVRQ_18-dnv}

#### Energy-Carrying Molecules {#3.html#x-ck12-RW5lcmd5LUNhcnJ5aW5nIE1vbGVjdWxlcw.._18-5pc}

You know that the fish you had for lunch contained protein molecules.
But do you know that the atoms in that protein could easily have formed
the color in a dragonfly’s eye, the heart of a water flea, and the
whiplike tail of a *Euglena* before they hit your plate as sleek fish
muscle? Food consists of organic (carbon-containing) molecules which
store energy in the chemical bonds between their atoms. Organisms use
the atoms of food molecules to build larger organic molecules including
proteins, DNA, and fats (lipids) and use the energy in food to power
life processes. By breaking the bonds in food molecules, cells release
energy to build new compounds. Although some energy dissipates as heat
at each energy transfer, much of it is stored in the newly made
molecules. Chemical bonds in organic molecules are a reservoir of the
energy used to make them. Fueled by the energy from food molecules,
cells can combine and recombine the elements of life to form thousands
of different molecules. Both the energy (despite some loss) and the
materials (despite being reorganized) pass from producer to consumer –
perhaps from algal tails, to water flea hearts, to dragonfly eye colors,
to fish muscle, to you!

The process of photosynthesis, which usually begins the flow of energy
through life, uses many different kinds of energy-carrying molecules to
transform sunlight energy into chemical energy and build food. Some
carrier molecules hold energy briefly, quickly shifting it like a hot
potato to other molecules. This strategy allows energy to be released in
small, controlled amounts. An example starts in **chlorophyll,** the
green pigment present in most plants, which helps convert solar energy
to chemical energy. When a chlorophyll molecule absorbs light energy,
electrons are excited and "jump" to a higher energy level. The excited
electrons then bounce to a series of carrier molecules, losing a little
energy at each step. Most of the "lost" energy powers some small
cellular task, such as moving ions across a membrane or building up
another molecule. Another short-term energy carrier important to
photosynthesis, **NADPH** , holds chemical energy a bit longer but soon
"spends" it to help to build sugar.

Two of the most important energy-carrying molecules are **glucose** and
adenosine triphosphate, commonly referred to as **ATP** . These are
nearly universal fuels throughout the living world and are both key
players in photosynthesis, as shown below.

#### Glucose {#3.html#x-ck12-R2x1Y29zZQ.._18-nbl}

A molecule of glucose, which has the chemical formula C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~
, carries a packet of chemical energy just the right size for transport
and uptake by cells. In your body, glucose is the "deliverable" form of
energy, carried in your blood through capillaries to each of your 100
trillion cells. Glucose is also the carbohydrate produced by
photosynthesis, and as such is the near-universal food for life.

**Figure 3.33**

Glucose is the energy-rich product of photosynthesis, a universal food
for life. It is also the primary form in which your bloodstream delivers
energy to every cell in your body.

</div>

#### ATP {#3.html#x-ck12-QVRQ_18-c7q}

ATP molecules store smaller quantities of energy, but each releases just
the right amount to actually do work within a cell. Muscle cell
proteins, for example, pull each other with the energy released when
bonds in ATP break open (discussed below). The process of photosynthesis
also makes and uses ATP - for energy to build glucose! ATP, then, is the
useable form of energy for your cells. ATP is commonly referred to as
the "energy currency" of the cell.

**Why do we need both glucose and ATP?**

Why don’t plants just make ATP and be done with it? If energy were
money, ATP would be a quarter. Enough money to operate a parking meter
or washing machine. Glucose would be a ten dollar bill – much easier to
carry around in your wallet, but too large to do the actual work of
paying for parking or washing. Just as we find several denominations of
money useful, organisms need several "denominations" of energy – a
smaller quantity for work within cells, and a larger quantity for stable
storage, transport, and delivery to cells. (Actually a glucose molecule
would be about \$9.50, as under the proper conditions, up to 38 ATP are
produced for each glucose molecule.)

Let’s take a closer look at a molecule of ATP. Although it carries less
energy than glucose, its structure is more complex. The "A" in ATP
refers to the majority of the molecule, adenosine, a combination of a
nitrogenous base and a five-carbon sugar. The "TP" indicates the three
phosphates, linked by bonds which hold the energy actually used by
cells. Usually, only the outermost bond breaks to release or spend
energy for cellular work.

An ATP molecule, shown in the **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvNDEtMDViYmI.) , is like a rechargeable
battery: its energy can be used by the cell when it breaks apart into
ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate, and then the "worn-out
battery" ADP can be recharged using new energy to attach a new phosphate
and rebuild ATP. The materials are recyclable, but recall that energy is
not!

How much energy does it cost to do your body’s work? A single cell uses
about 10 million ATP molecules per second, and recycles all of its ATP
molecules about every 20-30 seconds.

**What do pancakes and chloroplasts have in common?**

The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis. Part of the
photosynthesis reactions occur in an internal membrane within the
organelle. The chloroplast contains many of these internal membranes,
making photosynthesis very efficient. These internal membranes stack on
top of each other, just like a stack of pancakes.

### Stages of Photosynthesis {#3.html#x-ck12-U3RhZ2VzIG9mIFBob3Rvc3ludGhlc2lz_19-7nm}

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages, which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTA0LUxvSA..) .

1.  Stage I is called the **light reactions** . This stage uses water
    and changes light energy from the sun into chemical energy stored in
    ATP and NADPH (another energy-carrying molecule). This stage also
    releases oxygen as a waste product.
2.  Stage II is called the **Calvin cycle** . This stage combines carbon
    from carbon dioxide in the air and uses the chemical energy in ATP
    and NADPH to make glucose.

**Figure 3.35**

The two stages of photosynthesis are the light reactions and the Calvin
cycle. Do you see how the two stages are related?

</div>

Before you read about these two stages of photosynthesis in greater
detail, you need to know more about the chloroplast, where the two
stages take place.

### The Chloroplast {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENobG9yb3BsYXN0_19-pao}

**Chloroplasts: Theaters for Photosynthesis**

**Photosynthesis** , the process of turning the energy of sunlight into
‘‘food,’’ is divided into two basic sets of reactions, known as the
light reactions and the Calvin cycle, which uses carbon dioxide. As you
study the details in other concepts, refer frequently to the chemical
equation of photosynthesis: 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Light Energy → C ~6~ H
~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ . Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an
organelle specific to plant cells.

If you examine a single leaf of a Winter Jasmine leaf, shown in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hsb3JvcGxhc3Q.) , under a
microscope, you will see within each cell dozens of small green ovals.
These are **chloroplasts** , the organelles which conduct photosynthesis
in plants and algae. Chloroplasts closely resemble some types of
bacteria and even contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes. In fact,
the **endosymbiotic theory** holds that chloroplasts were once
independently living bacteria (prokaryotes). So when we say that
photosynthesis occurs within chloroplasts, we speak not only of the
organelles within plants and algae, but also of some bacteria – in other
words, virtually all photosynthetic autotrophs.

**Figure 3.36**

High power microscopic photo of the upper part of a Winter Jasmine leaf.
Viewed under a microscope, many green chloroplasts are visible.

</div>

Each chloroplast contains neat stacks called **grana** (singular,
granum). The grana consist of sac-like membranes, known as **thylakoid**
membranes. These membranes contain **photosystems** , which are groups
of molecules that include **chlorophyll** , a green pigment. The light
reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes. The
**stroma** is the space outside the thylakoid membranes, as shown in
**Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTA2LXBhcnRzLW9mLWNob2xvcnBsYXN0) . This
is where the reactions of the Calvin cycle take place. In addition to
enzymes, two basic types of molecules - pigments and **electron
carriers** – are key players in this process and are also found in the
thylakoid membranes.

A chloroplast consists of thylakoid membranes surrounded by stroma. The

Electron carrier molecules are usually arranged in **electron transport
chains** (ETCs). These accept and pass along energy-carrying electrons
in small steps ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTA3LUxpZ2h0LVJlYWN0aW9ucw..) ). In this
way, they produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical
energy. Electrons in transport chains behave much like a ball bouncing
down a set of stairs – a little energy is lost with each bounce.
However, the energy “lost” at each step in an electron transport chain
accomplishes a little bit of work, which eventually results in the
synthesis of ATP.

**Oxygen has been described as a ‘‘waste product’’. How is this
possible?**

Essentially, oxygen is a waste product of the light reactions of
photosynthesis. It is a ‘‘leftover’’ from a necessary part of the
process. All the oxygen that is necessary to maintain most forms of life
just happens to come about during this process.

### Photosynthesis Stage I: The Light Reactions {#3.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXMgU3RhZ2UgSTogVGhlIExpZ2h0IFJlYWN0aW9ucw.._20-l5o}

#### Chloroplasts Capture Sunlight {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hsb3JvcGxhc3RzIENhcHR1cmUgU3VubGlnaHQ._20-pdm}

Every second, the sun fuses over 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596
tons of helium, converting over 4 tons of helium (4.3 billion kg) into
light and heat energy. Countless tiny packets of that light energy
travel 93 million miles (150 million km) through space, and about 1% of
the light which reaches the Earth’s surface participates in
photosynthesis. Light is the source of energy for photosynthesis, and
the first set of reactions which begin the process requires light – thus
the name, **light reactions** , or light-dependent reactions.

When light strikes **chlorophyll** (or an accessory pigment) within the
chloroplast, it energizes electrons within that molecule. These
electrons jump up to higher energy levels; they have absorbed or
captured, and now carry, that energy. High-energy electrons are
“excited.” Who wouldn’t be excited to hold the energy for life?

The excited electrons leave chlorophyll to participate in further
reactions, leaving the chlorophyll “at a loss”; eventually they must be
replaced. That replacement process also requires light, working with an
enzyme complex to split water molecules. In this process of
**photolysis** (“splitting by light”), H ~2~ O molecules are broken into
hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms. The electrons replace those
originally lost from chlorophyll. Hydrogen ions and the high-energy
electrons from chlorophyll will carry on the energy transformation drama
after the light reactions are over.

The oxygen atoms, however, form oxygen gas, which is a waste product of
photosynthesis. The oxygen given off supplies most of the oxygen in our
atmosphere. Before photosynthesis evolved, Earth’s atmosphere lacked
oxygen altogether, and this highly reactive gas was toxic to the many
organisms living at the time. Something had to change! Most contemporary
organisms rely on oxygen for efficient respiration. So plants don’t just
“restore” the air, they also had a major role in creating it!

To summarize, chloroplasts “capture” sunlight energy in two ways. Light
‘‘excites’’ electrons in pigment molecules, and light provides the
energy to split water molecules, providing more electrons as well as
hydrogen ions.

#### Light Energy to Chemical Energy {#3.html#x-ck12-TGlnaHQgRW5lcmd5IHRvIENoZW1pY2FsIEVuZXJneQ.._20-v6h}

Excited electrons that have absorbed light energy are unstable. However,
the highly organized **electron carrier** molecules embedded in
chloroplast membranes order the flow of these electrons, directing them
through **electron transport chains** (ETCs). At each transfer, small
amounts of energy released by the electrons are captured and put to work
or stored. Some is also lost as heat with each transfer, but overall the
light reactions are extremely efficient at capturing light energy and
transforming it into chemical energy.

Two sequential transport chains harvest the energy of excited electrons,
as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvX1RoeWxha29pZF9NZW1icmFuZQ..) .

\(1) First, they pass down an ETC, which captures their energy and uses
it to pump hydrogen ions by active transport into the thylakoids. These
concentrated ions store potential energy by forming a chemiosmotic or
electrochemical gradient – a higher concentration of both positive
charge and hydrogen inside the thylakoid than outside. (The gradient
formed by the H ^+^ ions is known as a **chemiosmotic gradient** .)
Picture this energy buildup of H ^+^ as a dam holding back a waterfall.
Like water flowing through a hole in the dam, hydrogen ions “slide down”
their concentration gradient through a membrane protein which acts as
both ion channel and enzyme. As they flow, the ion channel/enzyme **ATP
synthase** uses their energy to chemically bond a phosphate group to
ADP, making ATP.

\(2) Light re-energizes the electrons, and they travel down a second
electron transport chain (ETC), eventually bonding hydrogen ions to NADP
^+^ to form a more stable energy storage molecule, **NADPH** . NADPH is
sometimes called “hot hydrogen,” and its energy and hydrogen atoms will
be used to help build sugar in the second stage of photosynthesis.

the chloroplast.

</div>

NADPH and ATP molecules now store the energy from excited electrons –
energy which was originally sunlight – in chemical bonds. Thus
chloroplasts, with their orderly arrangement of pigments, enzymes, and
electron transport chains, transform light energy into chemical energy.
The first stage of photosynthesis – light-dependent reactions or simply
light reactions – is complete.

in common?**

They are full of energy. Energy in the form of glucose. The energy from
sunlight is briefly held in NADPH and ATP, which is needed to drive the

You’ve learned that the first, light-dependent stage of photosynthesis
uses two of the three reactants, water and light, and produces one of
the products, oxygen gas (a waste product of this process). All three
necessary conditions are required – chlorophyll pigments, the
chloroplast “theater,” and enzyme catalysts. The first stage transforms
light energy into chemical energy, stored to this point in molecules of
ATP and NADPH. Look again at the overall equation below. What is left?

Waiting in the wings is one more reactant, carbon dioxide, and yet to
come is the star product, which is food for all life – glucose. These
key players perform in the second act of the photosynthesis drama, in
which food is “made from thin air!”

The second stage of photosynthesis can proceed without light, so its
steps are sometimes called “light-independent” or “dark” reactions
(though the term ‘‘dark’’ reactions can be misleading). Many biologists
honor the scientist, Melvin Calvin, who won a 1961 Nobel Prize for
working out this complex set of chemical reactions, naming it the
**Calvin cycle** .

The Calvin cycle has two parts. First carbon dioxide is ‘‘fixed’’. Then
ATP and NADPH from the light reactions provide energy to combine the
fixed carbons to make sugar.

#### Carbon Dioxide is “Fixed” {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uIERpb3hpZGUgaXMg4oCcRml4ZWTigJ0._21-bi5}

Why does carbon dioxide need to be fixed? Was it ever broken?

Life on Earth is carbon-based. Organisms need not only energy but also
carbon atoms for building bodies. For nearly all life, the ultimate
source of carbon is carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ), an inorganic molecule. CO
~2~ makes up less than 1% of the Earth’s atmosphere.

Animals and most other heterotrophs cannot take in CO ~2~ directly. They
must eat other organisms or absorb **organic molecules** to get carbon.
Only autotrophs can build low-energy inorganic CO ~2~ into high-energy
organic molecules like glucose. This process is **carbon fixation** .

**Figure 3.40**

Stomata on the underside of leaves take in CO ~2~ and release water and
O ~2~ . Guard cells close the stomata when water is scarce. Leaf
cross-section (above) and stoma (below).

</div>

Plants have evolved three pathways for carbon fixation.

The most common pathway combines one molecule of CO ~2~ with a 5-carbon
sugar called ribulose biphosphate (RuBP). The enzyme which catalyzes
this reaction (nicknamed **RuBisCo** ) is the most abundant enzyme on
earth! The resulting 6-carbon molecule is unstable, so it immediately
splits into two 3-carbon molecules. The 3 carbons in the first stable
molecule of this pathway give this largest group of plants the name “C
~3~ .”

Dry air, hot temperatures, and bright sunlight slow the C ~3~ pathway
for carbon fixation. This is because **stomata** , tiny openings under
the leaf which normally allow CO ~2~ to enter and O ~2~ to leave, must
close to prevent loss of water vapor ( **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvNC0yLW4xMA..) ). Closed stomata lead to a
shortage of CO ~2~ . Two alternative pathways for carbon fixation
demonstrate biochemical adaptations to differing environments.

Plants such as corn solve the problem by using a separate compartment to
fix CO ~2~ . Here CO ~2~ combines with a 3-carbon molecule, resulting in
a 4-carbon molecule. Because the first stable organic molecule has four
carbons, this adaptation has the name C ~4~ . Shuttled away from the
initial fixation site, the 4-carbon molecule is actually broken back
down into CO ~2~ , and when enough accumulates, RuBisCo fixes it a
second time! Compartmentalization allows efficient use of low
concentrations of carbon dioxide in these specialized plants.

Cacti and succulents such as the jade plant avoid water loss by fixing
CO ~2~ only at night. These plants close their stomata during the day
and open them only in the cooler and more humid nighttime hours. Leaf
structure differs slightly from that of C ~4~ plants, but the fixation
pathways are similar. The family of plants in which this pathway was
discovered gives the pathway its name, Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, or
CAM ( **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvNC0yLW4xMQ..) ). All three
carbon fixation pathways lead to the Calvin cycle to build sugar.

#### How Does the Calvin Cycle Store Energy in Sugar? {#3.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvZXMgdGhlIENhbHZpbiBDeWNsZSBTdG9yZSBFbmVyZ3kgaW4gU3VnYXI__21-m4j}

As Melvin Calvin discovered, carbon fixation is the first step of a
cycle. Like an electron transport chain, the Calvin cycle, shown in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvNC0yLTEy) , transfers energy in
small, controlled steps. Each step pushes molecules uphill in terms of
energy content. Recall that in the electron transfer chain, excited
electrons lose energy to NADPH and ATP. In the Calvin cycle, NADPH and
ATP formed in the light reactions lose their stored chemical energy to
build glucose.

Use the **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvNC0yLTEy) to identify the
major aspects of the process:

-   the general cycle pattern
-   the major reactants
-   the products

Cycle](ck12_3_files/20150914104110379035.png "Mechanism of the Calvin Cycle")

**Figure 3.42**

Overview of the Calvin Cycle Pathway.

</div>

First, notice where carbon is fixed by the enzyme nicknamed RuBisCo. In
C ~3~ , C ~4~ , and CAM plants, CO ~2~ enters the cycle by joining with
5-carbon ribulose bisphosphate to form a 6-carbon intermediate, which
splits (so quickly that it isn’t even shown!) into two 3-carbon
molecules.

Now look for the points at which ATP and NADPH (made in the light
reactions) add chemical energy (“Reduction” in the diagram) to the
3-carbon molecules. The resulting “half-sugars” can enter several
different metabolic pathways. One recreates the original 5-carbon
precursor, completing the cycle. A second combines two of the 3-carbon
molecules to form glucose, universal fuel for life.

The cycle begins and ends with the same molecule, but the process
combines carbon and energy to build carbohydrates – food for life.

So, how does photosynthesis store energy in sugar? Six “turns” of the
Calvin cycle use chemical energy from ATP to combine six carbon atoms
from six CO ~2~ molecules with 12 “hot hydrogens” from NADPH. The result
is one molecule of glucose, C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ .

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-eyc}

-   The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in
    the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP.
-   These reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were

**What is photosynthesis?**

The process of using the energy in sunlight to make food (glucose). Is
it really as simple as that? Of course not. As you have seen,
photosynthesis includes many steps all conveniently condensed into one
simple equation. In the five concepts describing photosynthesis, this
process has been presented in an introductory fashion. Obviously, much
more details could have been included, though those are beyond the scope
of these concepts.

#### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-3zn}

The following 10 points summarize photosynthesis.

-   6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Light Energy → C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~
-   Autotrophs store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they
    build themselves. Most autotrophs make their "food" through
    photosynthesis using the energy of the sun.
-   Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle specific to
    plant cells.
-   The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid
    membranes of the chloroplast.
-   Electron carrier molecules are arranged in electron transport chains
    that produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy.
-   The light reactions capture energy from sunlight, which they change
    to chemical energy that is stored in molecules of NADPH and ATP.
-   The light reactions also release oxygen gas as a waste product.
-   The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in
    the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP.
-   The Calvin cycle reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP
    that were produced in the light reactions.
-   The final product of the Calvin cycle is glucose.

#### FAQs {#3.html#x-ck12-RkFRcw.._22-avd}

-   **What is photosynthesis?**

The process of using the energy in sunlight to make food (glucose). But
of course it is much more complex than that simple statement.
Photosynthesis is a multistep biochemical pathway that uses the energy
in sunlight to fix carbon dioxide, transferring the energy into
carbohydrates, and releasing oxygen in the process.

-   **What is NADPH?**

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, an energy carrier molecule
produced in the light reactions of photosynthesis. NADPH is the reduced
form of the electron acceptor NADP ^+^ . At the end of the light
reactions, the energy from sunlight is transferred to NADP ^+^ ,
producing NADPH. This energy in NADPH is then used in the Calvin cycle.

-   **Where do the protons used in the light reactions come from?**

The protons used in the light reactions come from photolysis, the
splitting of water, in which H ~2~ O molecules are broken into hydrogen
ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms. In addition, the energy from sunlight
is used to pump protons into the thylakoid lumen during the first
electron transport chain, forming a chemiosmotic gradient.

-   **How do you distinguish between the Calvin cycle and the Krebs
    cycle?**

The Calvin cycle is part of the light-independent reactions of
photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH. The Krebs cycle is
part of cellular respiration. This cycle makes ATP and NAPH.

-   **Do photosynthesis and cellular respiration occur at the same time
    in a plant?**

Yes. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, whereas cellular
respiration occurs in the mitochondria. Photosynthesis makes glucose and
oxygen, which are then used as the starting products for cellular
respiration. Cellular respiration makes carbon dioxide and water (and
ATP), which are the starting products (together with sunlight) for
photosynthesis.

#### Common Misconceptions {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29tbW9uIE1pc2NvbmNlcHRpb25z_22-n0b}

-   A common student misconception is that plants photosynthesize only
    during daylight and conduct cellular respiration only at night. Some
    teaching literature even states this. Though it is true the light
    reactions can only occur when the sun is out, cellular respiration
    occurs continuously in plants, not just at night.

<!-- -->

-   The “dark reactions” of photosynthesis are a misnomer that often
    leads students to believe that photosynthetic carbon fixation occurs
    at night. This is not true. It is preferable to use the term Calvin
    cycle or light-independent reactions instead of dark reactions.

<!-- -->

-   Though the final product of photosynthesis is glucose, the glucose
    is conveniently stored as starch. Starch is approximated as (C ~6~ H
    ~10~ O ~5~ ) ~n~ , where n is in the thousands. Starch is formed by
    the condensation of thousands of glucose molecules.

**Is it possible to live in temperatures over 175°F?**

It is if you're a Pompeii worm. The Pompeii worm, the most heat-tolerant
animal on Earth, lives in the deep ocean at super-heated hydrothermal
vents. Covering this deep-sea worm's back is a fleece of bacteria. These
microbes contain all the genes necessary for life in extreme
environments.

### Chemosynthesis {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbW9zeW50aGVzaXM._23-4gx}

Why do bacteria that live deep below the ocean’s surface rely on
chemical compounds instead of sunlight for energy to make food?

Most autotrophs make food by photosynthesis, but this isn’t the only way
that autotrophs produce food. Some bacteria make food by another
process, which uses chemical energy instead of light energy. This
process is called **chemosynthesis** . In chemosynthesis, one or more
carbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane, CH ~4~ ) and
nutrients is converted into organic matter, using the oxidation of
inorganic molecules (such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide (H ~2~ S) or
ammonia (NH ~3~ )) or methane as a source of energy, rather than
sunlight. In hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis, in the presence of carbon
dioxide and oxygen, carbohydrates (CH ~2~ O) can be produced:

CO ~2~ + O ~2~ + 4H ~2~ S → CH ~2~ O + 4S + 3H ~2~ O

Many organisms that use chemosynthesis are **extremophiles,** living in
harsh conditions, such as in the absence of sunlight and a wide range of
water temperatures, some approaching the boiling point. Some
chemosynthetic bacteria live around deep-ocean vents known as “black
smokers.” Compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, which flow out of the
vents from Earth’s interior, are used by the bacteria for energy to make
food. Consumers that depend on these bacteria to produce food for them
include giant tubeworms, like those pictured in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTA5LXR1YmV3b3Jtcw..) . These organisms
are known as **chemoautotrophs.** Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are
consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations
between these organisms and respiring heterotrophs are quite common.

Tubeworms deep in the Galapagos Rift get their energy from
chemosynthetic bacteria. Tubeworms have no mouth, eyes or stomach. Their
survival depends on a symbiotic relationship with the billions of
bacteria that live inside them. These bacteria convert the chemicals
that shoot out of the hydrothermal vents into food for the worm.

**How long can you hold your breath?**

With or without air? In terms of producing energy, that is the key
question. Can cellular respiration occur without air? It can, but it
does have limitations.

### The Presence of Oxygen {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByZXNlbmNlIG9mIE94eWdlbg.._24-3bl}

There are two types of cellular respiration (see *Cellular Respiration*
concept): aerobic and anaerobic. One occurs in the presence of oxygen (
**aerobic** ), and one occurs in the absence of oxygen ( **anaerobic**
). Both begin with **glycolysis** - the splitting of glucose.

Glycolysis (see "Glycolysis" concept) is an **anaerobic** process - it
does not need oxygen to proceed. This process produces a minimal amount
of ATP. The Krebs cycle and electron transport do need oxygen to
proceed, and in the presence of oxygen, these process produce much more
ATP than glycolysis alone.

Scientists think that glycolysis evolved before the other stages of
cellular respiration. This is because the other stages need oxygen,
whereas glycolysis does not, and there was no oxygen in Earth’s
atmosphere when life first evolved about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago.
Cellular respiration that proceeds without oxygen is called **anaerobic
respiration** .

Then, about 2 or 3 billion years ago, oxygen was gradually added to the
atmosphere by early photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria). After that,
living things could use oxygen to break down glucose and make ATP.
Today, most organisms make ATP with oxygen. They follow glycolysis with
the Krebs cycle and electron transport to make more ATP than by
glycolysis alone. Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of
oxygen is called **aerobic respiration** .

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-4op}

-   Cellular respiration always begins with glycolysis, which can occur
    either in the absence or presence of oxygen.
-   Cellular respiration that proceeds in the absence of oxygen is
    anaerobic respiration.
-   Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of oxygen is
    aerobic respiration.
-   Anaerobic respiration evolved prior to aerobic respiration.

**Why eat?**

Because we're hungry. Not necessarily. But biologically speaking…we eat
to get energy. The food we eat is broken down, the glucose extracted,
and that energy is converted into ATP.

### Cellular Respiration {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24._25-dzf}

What happens to the energy stored in glucose during photosynthesis? How
do living things make use of this stored energy? The answer is
**cellular respiration** . This process releases the energy in glucose
to make **ATP** (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that powers all
the work of cells.

#### Stages of Cellular Respiration {#3.html#x-ck12-U3RhZ2VzIG9mIENlbGx1bGFyIFJlc3BpcmF0aW9u_25-6cf}

Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions. The reactions can
be summed up in this equation:

C ~6~ H ~12~ O ~6~ + 6O ~2~ → 6CO ~2~ + 6H ~2~ O + Chemical Energy (in
ATP)

The reactions of cellular respiration can be grouped into three stages:
**glycolysis** (stage 1), the **Krebs cycle** , also called the **citric
acid cycle** (stage 2), and **electron transport** (stage 3). **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTEwLVN0YWdlcy1vZi1jZWxsdWxhci1SZXNwaXJhdGlvbg..)
gives an overview of these three stages, which are further discussed in
the concepts that follow. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell
and does not require oxygen, whereas the Krebs cycle and electron
transport occur in the mitochondria and do require oxygen.

As you can see from **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTEyLU1pdG9jaG9uZHJpb24.) , a
mitochondrion has an inner and outer membrane. The space between the
inner and outer membrane is called the intermembrane space. The space
enclosed by the inner membrane is called the matrix. The second stage of
cellular respiration, the Krebs cycle, takes place in the matrix. The
third stage, electron transport, takes place on the inner membrane.

**How do you slice a molecule of glucose in half?**

With sharp knives? Not really. But you essentially slice it in half
through glycolysis. This is an extremely important part of cellular
respiration. It happens all the time, both with and without oxygen. And
in the process, transfers some energy to ATP.

### Cellular Respiration Stage I: Glycolysis {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24gU3RhZ2UgSTogR2x5Y29seXNpcw.._26-feb}

The first stage of cellular respiration is **glycolysis** . It does not
require oxygen, and it does not take place in the mitochondrion - it
takes place in the cytosol of the cytoplasm.

When was the last time you enjoyed yogurt on your breakfast cereal, or
had a tetanus shot? These experiences may appear unconnected, but both
relate to bacteria which do not use oxygen to make ATP. In fact, tetanus
bacteria cannot survive if oxygen is present. However, *Lactobacillus
acidophilus* (bacteria which make yogurt) and *Clostridium tetani*
(bacteria which cause tetanus or lockjaw) share with nearly all
organisms the first stage of cellular respiration, glycolysis. Because
glycolysis is universal, whereas **aerobic** (oxygen-requiring) cellular
respiration is not, most biologists consider it to be the most
fundamental and primitive pathway for making ATP.

#### Splitting Glucose {#3.html#x-ck12-U3BsaXR0aW5nIEdsdWNvc2U._26-ota}

The word *glycolysis* means “glucose splitting,” which is exactly what
happens in this stage. Enzymes split a molecule of glucose into two
molecules of **pyruvate** (also known as pyruvic acid). This occurs in
several steps, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTExLUdseWNvbHlzaXM.) . You can watch an
animation of the steps of glycolysis at this link:

**Figure 3.46**

In glycolysis, glucose (C6) is split into two 3-carbon (C3) pyruvate
molecules. This releases energy, which is transferred to ATP. How many
ATP molecules are made during this stage of cellular respiration?

</div>

#### Results of Glycolysis {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVzdWx0cyBvZiBHbHljb2x5c2lz_26-mdh}

Energy is needed at the start of glycolysis to split the glucose
molecule into two pyruvate molecules. These two molecules go on to stage
II of cellular respiration. The energy to split glucose is provided by
two molecules of ATP. As glycolysis proceeds, energy is released, and
the energy is used to make four molecules of ATP. As a result, there is
a net gain of two ATP molecules during glycolysis. During this stage,
high-energy electrons are also transferred to molecules of NAD ^+^ to
produce two molecules of **NADH** , another energy-carrying molecule.
NADH is used in stage III of cellular respiration to make more ATP.

**What type of acid do these fruits contain?**

Citric acid. Citric acid is also the first product formed in the Krebs
cycle, and therefore this acid occurs in the metabolism of virtually all
living things.

### Cellular Respiration Stage II: The Krebs Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24gU3RhZ2UgSUk6IFRoZSBLcmVicyBDeWNsZQ.._27-vic}

Recall that glycolysis, stage I of cellular respiration, produces two
molecules of pyruvate. These molecules enter the matrix of a
mitochondrion, where they start the **Krebs cycle** . The reactions that
occur next are shown in **Figure**

![Steps of the Krebs
Cycle](ck12_3_files/20150914104112903173.jpeg "Steps of the Krebs Cycle")

**Figure 3.47**

The Krebs cycle starts with pyruvic acid from glycolysis. Each small
circle in the diagram represents one carbon atom. For example, citric
acid is a six carbon molecule, and OAA (oxaloacetate) is a four carbon
molecule. Follow what happens to the carbon atoms as the cycle proceeds.
In one turn through the cycle, how many molecules are produced of ATP?
How many molecules of NADH and FADH ~2~ are produced?

</div>

Before the Krebs cycle begins, pyruvic acid, which has three carbon
atoms, is split apart and combined with an enzyme known as CoA, which
stands for coenzyme A. The product of this reaction is a two-carbon
molecule called acetyl-CoA. The third carbon from pyruvic acid combines
with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is released as a waste
product. High-energy electrons are also released and captured in NADH.

#### Steps of the Krebs Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHMgb2YgdGhlIEtyZWJzIEN5Y2xl_27-gnk}

The Krebs cycle itself actually begins when acetyl-CoA combines with a
four-carbon molecule called OAA (oxaloacetate) (see **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTEzLUtyZWJzLUN5Y2xl) ). This produces
citric acid, which has six carbon atoms. This is why the Krebs cycle is
also called the **citric acid cycle** .

After citric acid forms, it goes through a series of reactions that
release energy. The energy is captured in molecules of NADH, ATP, and
FADH ~2~ , another energy-carrying compound. Carbon dioxide is also
released as a waste product of these reactions.

The final step of the Krebs cycle regenerates OAA, the molecule that
began the Krebs cycle. This molecule is needed for the next turn through
the cycle. Two turns are needed because glycolysis produces two pyruvic
acid molecules when it splits glucose. Watch the OSU band present the
Krebs cycle:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXnH087JIk](watch?v=FgXnH087JIk) .

#### Results of the Krebs Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVzdWx0cyBvZiB0aGUgS3JlYnMgQ3ljbGU._27-itb}

After the second turn through the Krebs cycle, the original glucose
molecule has been broken down completely. All six of its carbon atoms
have combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The energy from its
chemical bonds has been stored in a total of 16 energy-carrier
molecules. These molecules are:

-   4 ATP (including 2 from glycolysis)
-   10 NADH (including 2 from glycolysis)
-   2 FADH ~2~

**Train, truck, boat or plane?**

Ways to transport. To make ATP, energy must be ‘‘transported’’ - first
from glucose to NADH, and then somehow passed to ATP. How is this done?
With an electron transport chain.

### Cellular Respiration Stage III: Electron Transport {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHVsYXIgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24gU3RhZ2UgSUlJOiBFbGVjdHJvbiBUcmFuc3BvcnQ._28-hbp}

**Electron transport** is the final stage of aerobic respiration. In
this stage, energy from NADH and FADH ~2~ , which result from the Krebs
cycle, is transferred to ATP. Can you predict how this happens? (
*Hint:* How does electron transport occur in photosynthesis?)

See [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1engJR\_XWVU](watch?v=1engJR_XWVU)
for an overview of the electron transport chain.

#### Transporting Electrons {#3.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNwb3J0aW5nIEVsZWN0cm9ucw.._28-bgc}

High-energy electrons are released from NADH and FADH ~2~ , and they
move along **electron transport chains** , like those used in
photosynthesis. The electron transport chains are on the inner membrane
of the mitochondrion. As the high-energy electrons are transported along
the chains, some of their energy is captured. This energy is used to
pump hydrogen ions (from NADH and FADH ~2~ ) across the inner membrane,
from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Electron transport in a
mitochondrion is shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-TWl0b2Nob25kcmlhbEVUQw..) .

**Figure 3.48**

Electron-transport chains on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion
carry out the last stage of cellular respiration.

</div>

#### Making ATP {#3.html#x-ck12-TWFraW5nIEFUUA.._28-yji}

The pumping of hydrogen ions across the inner membrane creates a greater
concentration of the ions in the intermembrane space than in the matrix.
This **chemiosmotic gradient** causes the ions to flow back across the
membrane into the matrix, where their concentration is lower. **ATP
synthase** acts as a channel protein, helping the hydrogen ions cross
the membrane. It also acts as an enzyme, forming ATP from ADP and
inorganic phosphate. After passing through the electron-transport chain,
the “spent” electrons combine with oxygen to form water. This is why
oxygen is needed; in the absence of oxygen, this process cannot occur.

How much ATP is produced? The two NADH produced in the cytoplasm
produces 2 to 3 ATP each (4 to 6 total) by the electron transport
system, the 8 NADH produced in the mitochondria produces three ATP each
(24 total), and the 2 FADH ~2~ adds its electrons to the electron
transport system at a lower level than NADH, so they produce two ATP
each (4 total). This results in the formation of 34 ATP during the
electron transport stage.

A summary of this process can be seen at the following sites:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgCcFXUZRk](watch?v=fgCcFXUZRk) (17:16)

**When you combine grapes and yeast, what have you begun to make?**

Wine. It may be slightly more complicated than that, but you need to
start with grapes and yeast, and allow a natural fermentation process to
occur. Essentially, this is respiration without oxygen.

### Anaerobic Respiration: Fermentation {#3.html#x-ck12-QW5hZXJvYmljIFJlc3BpcmF0aW9uOiBGZXJtZW50YXRpb24._29-xbl}

Today, most living things use oxygen to make ATP from glucose. However,
many living things can also make ATP without oxygen. This is true of
some plants and fungi and also of many bacteria. These organisms use
aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but when oxygen is in short
supply, they use **anaerobic respiration** instead. Certain bacteria can
only use anaerobic respiration. In fact, they may not be able to survive
at all in the presence of oxygen.

An important way of making ATP without oxygen is called **fermentation**
. It involves glycolysis, but not the other two stages of aerobic
respiration. Many bacteria and yeasts carry out fermentation. People use
these organisms to make yogurt, bread, wine, and biofuels. Human muscle
cells also use fermentation. This occurs when muscle cells cannot get
oxygen fast enough to meet their energy needs through aerobic
respiration.

There are two types of fermentation: lactic acid fermentation and
alcoholic fermentation. Both types of fermentation are described below.
You can also watch animations of both types at this link:
[http://www.cst.cmich.edu/users/schul1te/animations/fermentation.swf](fermentation.swf)
.

#### Lactic Acid Fermentation {#3.html#x-ck12-TGFjdGljIEFjaWQgRmVybWVudGF0aW9u_29-hda}

In **lactic acid fermentation** , pyruvic acid from glycolysis changes
to lactic acid. This is shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTE1LUxhY3RpZC1BY2lkLUZlcm1lbnRhdGlvbg..)
. In the process, NAD ^+^ forms from NADH. NAD ^+^ , in turn, lets
glycolysis continue. This results in additional molecules of ATP. This
type of fermentation is carried out by the bacteria in yogurt. It is
also used by your own muscle cells when you work them hard and fast.

Did you ever run a race and notice that your muscles feel tired and sore
afterward? This is because your muscle cells used lactic acid
fermentation for energy. This causes lactic acid to build up in the
muscles. It is the buildup of lactic acid that makes the muscles feel
tired and sore.

#### Alcoholic Fermentation {#3.html#x-ck12-QWxjb2hvbGljIEZlcm1lbnRhdGlvbg.._29-wvj}

In **alcoholic fermentation** , pyruvic acid changes to alcohol and
carbon dioxide. This is shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTE2LUFsY29ob2xpYy1GZXJtZW50YXRpb24.) .
NAD ^+^ also forms from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue making
ATP. This type of fermentation is carried out by yeasts and some
bacteria. It is used to make bread, wine, and biofuels.

Have your parents ever put corn in the gas tank of their car? They did
if they used gas containing ethanol. Ethanol is produced by alcoholic
fermentation of the glucose in corn or other plants. This type of
fermentation also explains why bread dough rises. Yeasts in bread dough
use alcoholic fermentation and produce carbon dioxide gas. The gas forms
bubbles in the dough, which cause the dough to expand. The bubbles also
leave small holes in the bread after it bakes, making the bread light
and fluffy. Do you see the small holes in the slice of bread in

**Why oxygen?**

Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron
transport chain of aerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, only a
few ATP are produced from glucose. In the presence of oxygen, many more
ATP are made.

### Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration: A Comparison {#3.html#x-ck12-QWVyb2JpYyB2cy4gQW5hZXJvYmljIFJlc3BpcmF0aW9uOiBBIENvbXBhcmlzb24._30-ohs}

**Aerobic respiration** , which takes place in the presence of oxygen,
evolved after oxygen was added to Earth’s atmosphere. This type of
respiration is useful today because the atmosphere is now 21% oxygen.
However, some anaerobic organisms that evolved before the atmosphere
contained oxygen have survived to the present. Therefore, **anaerobic
respiration** , which takes place without oxygen, must also have
advantages.

#### Advantages of Aerobic Respiration {#3.html#x-ck12-QWR2YW50YWdlcyBvZiBBZXJvYmljIFJlc3BpcmF0aW9u_30-cft}

A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it
releases. Without oxygen, organisms can split glucose into just two
molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP
molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to
carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP
molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than
anaerobic respiration.

The amount of energy produced by aerobic respiration may explain why
aerobic organisms came to dominate life on Earth. It may also explain
how organisms were able to become multicellular and increase in size.

#### Advantages of Anaerobic Respiration {#3.html#x-ck12-QWR2YW50YWdlcyBvZiBBbmFlcm9iaWMgUmVzcGlyYXRpb24._30-i9s}

One advantage of anaerobic respiration is obvious. It lets organisms
live in places where there is little or no oxygen. Such places include
deep water, soil, and the digestive tracts of animals such as humans
(see **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTE4LUUuY29saQ..) ).

*E. coli* bacteria are anaerobic bacteria that live in the human
digestive tract.

</div>

Another advantage of anaerobic respiration is its speed. It produces ATP
very quickly. For example, it lets your muscles get the energy they need
for short bursts of intense activity (see **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA0LTE5LVJ1bm5lcnM.) ). Aerobic respiration,
on the other hand, produces ATP more slowly.

**Where do cells come from?**

No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through
the process of cell division. The cell may be the simplest bacterium or
a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell. The cell may comprise the whole
organism, or be just one cell of trillions.

### Cell Division {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBEaXZpc2lvbg.._31-1ua}

You consist of a great many cells, but like all other organisms, you
started life as a single cell. How did you develop from a single cell
into an organism with trillions of cells? The answer is cell division.
After cells grow to their maximum size, they divide into two new cells.
These new cells are small at first, but they grow quickly and eventually
divide and produce more new cells. This process keeps repeating in a
continuous cycle.

**Cell division** is the process in which one cell, called the **parent
cell** , divides to form two new cells, referred to as **daughter
cells** . How this happens depends on whether the cell is prokaryotic or
eukaryotic.

Cell division is simpler in prokaryotes than eukaryotes because
prokaryotic cells themselves are simpler. Prokaryotic cells have a
single circular chromosome, no nucleus, and few other organelles.
Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have multiple chromosomes contained
within a nucleus, and many other organelles. All of these cell parts
must be duplicated and then separated when the cell divides. A
**chromosome** is a molecule of DNA, and will be the focus of a
subsequent concept.

#### Cell Division in Prokaryotes {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBEaXZpc2lvbiBpbiBQcm9rYXJ5b3Rlcw.._31-hbf}

Most prokaryotic cells divide by the process of **binary fission** . A
bacterial cell dividing this way is depicted in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTAxLUJpbmFyeS1GaXNzaW9u) . You can also

**Figure 3.54**

Binary Fission in a Bacterial Cell. Cell division is relatively simple
in prokaryotic cells. The two cells are dividing by binary fission.
Green and orange lines indicate old and newly-generated bacterial cell
walls, respectively. Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form
two identical daughter cells. Left, growth at the center of bacterial
body. Right, apical growth from the ends of the bacterial body.

</div>

Binary fission can be described as a series of steps, although it is
actually a continuous process. The steps are described below and also
illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHMtb2YtQmluYXJ5LUZpc3Npb24.) . They include
DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and finally the separation into
two daughter cells.

-   Step 1: DNA Replication. Just before the cell divides, its DNA is
    copied in a process called DNA replication. This results in two
    identical chromosomes instead of just one. This step is necessary so
    that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will have its
    own chromosome.
-   Step 2: Chromosome Segregation. The two chromosomes segregate, or
    separate, and move to opposite ends (known as "poles") of the cell.
    This occurs as each copy of DNA attaches to different parts of the
    cell membrane.
-   Step 3: Separation. A new plasma membrane starts growing into the
    center of the cell, and the cytoplasm splits apart, forming two
    daughter cells. As the cell begins to pull apart, the new and the
    original chromosomes are separated. The two daughter cells that
    result are genetically identical to each other and to the
    parent cell. New cell wall must also form around the two cells.

#### Cell Division in Eukaryotes {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbCBEaXZpc2lvbiBpbiBFdWthcnlvdGVz_31-2uf}

Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Prior to
dividing, all the DNA in a eukaryotic cell’s multiple chromosomes is
replicated. Its organelles are also duplicated. Then, when the cell
divides, it occurs in two major steps:

1.  The first step is **mitosis** , a multi-phase process in which the
    nucleus of the cell divides. During mitosis, the nuclear membrane
    breaks down and later reforms. The chromosomes are also sorted and
    separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a diploid
    number (2 sets) of chromosomes. In humans, that number of
    chromosomes is 46 (23 pairs). Mitosis is described in greater detail
    in a subsequent concept.
2.  The second major step is cytokinesis. As in prokaryotic cells, the
    cytoplasm must divide. Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm
    in eukaryotic cells, resulting in two genetically identical
    daughter cells.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._31-qkl}

-   Cell division is part of the life cycle of virtually all cells. Cell
    division is the process in which one cell divides to form two
    new cells.
-   Most prokaryotic cells divide by the process of binary fission.
-   In eukaryotes, cell division occurs in two major steps: mitosis
    and cytokinesis.

**What is a cell's life like?**

The eukaryotic cell spends most of its "life" in interphase of the cell
cycle, which can be subdivided into the three phases, G1, S and G2.
During interphase, the cell does what it is supposed to do. Though cells
have many common functions, such as DNA replication, they also have
certain specific functions. That is, during the life of a heart cell,
the cell would obviously perform certain different activities than a
kidney cell or a liver cell.

### The Cell Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbGwgQ3ljbGU._32-pye}

Cell division is just one of several stages that a cell goes through
during its lifetime. The **cell cycle** is a repeating series of events
that include growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division. The cell cycle in
prokaryotes is quite simple: the cell grows, its DNA replicates, and the
cell divides. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated.

#### The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEV1a2FyeW90aWMgQ2VsbCBDeWNsZQ.._32-ijg}

The diagram in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-RXVrYXJ5b3RpYy1DZWxsLUN5Y2xl) represents the cell
cycle of a eukaryotic cell. As you can see, the eukaryotic cell cycle
has several phases. The **mitotic phase** (M) actually includes both
mitosis and cytokinesis. This is when the nucleus and then the cytoplasm
divide. The other three phases (G1, S, and G2) are generally grouped
together as **interphase** . During interphase, the cell grows, performs
routine life processes, and prepares to divide. These phases are
discussed below. You can watch a eukaryotic cell going through these
phases of the cell cycle at the following link:
[http://www.cellsalive.com/cell\_cycle.htm](cell_cycle.htm) .

Eukaryotic Cell Cycle. This diagram represents the cell cycle in
eukaryotes. The First Gap, Synthesis, and Second Gap phases make up
interphase (I). The M (mitotic) phase includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
After the M phase, two cells result.

</div>

#### Interphase {#3.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJwaGFzZQ.._32-szv}

Interphase of the eukaryotic cell cycle can be subdivided into the
following three phases, which are represented in **Figure**
[above](#3.html#x-ck12-RXVrYXJ5b3RpYy1DZWxsLUN5Y2xl) :

-   **Growth Phase 1 (G1):** during this phase, the cell grows rapidly,
    while performing routine metabolic processes. It also makes proteins
    needed for DNA replication and copies some of its organelles in
    preparation for cell division. A cell typically spends most of its
    life in this phase. This phase is sometimes referred to as Gap 1.
-   **Synthesis Phase (S):** during this phase, the cell’s DNA is copied
    in the process of **DNA replication** .
-   **Growth Phase 2 (G2):** during this phase, the cell makes final
    preparations to divide. For example, it makes additional proteins
    and organelles. This phase is sometimes referred to as Gap 2.

#### Control of the Cell Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbCBvZiB0aGUgQ2VsbCBDeWNsZQ.._32-ead}

If the cell cycle occurred without regulation, cells might go from one
phase to the next before they were ready. What controls the cell cycle?
How does the cell know when to grow, synthesize DNA, and divide? The
cell cycle is controlled mainly by regulatory proteins. These proteins
control the cycle by signaling the cell to either start or delay the
next phase of the cycle. They ensure that the cell completes the
previous phase before moving on. Regulatory proteins control the cell
cycle at key checkpoints, which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-VGhlLUNlbGwtQ3ljbGUtYW5kLUNoZWNrcG9pbnRz) . There
are a number of main checkpoints.

-   The G1 checkpoint, just before entry into S phase, makes the key
    decision of whether the cell should divide.
-   The S checkpoint determines if the DNA has been replicated properly.
-   The mitotic spindle checkpoint occurs at the point in metaphase
    where all the chromosomes should have aligned at the mitotic plate.

#### Cancer and the Cell Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2FuY2VyIGFuZCB0aGUgQ2VsbCBDeWNsZQ.._32-mf1}

**Cancer** is a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer
regulated. This may happen because a cell’s DNA becomes damaged. Damage
can occur due to exposure to hazards such as radiation or toxic
chemicals. Cancerous cells generally divide much faster than normal
cells. They may form a mass of abnormal cells called a **tumor** (see
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTA1LVR1bW9yLWNlbGxz) ). The
rapidly dividing cells take up nutrients and space that normal cells
need. This can damage tissues and organs and eventually lead to death.

**How is it assured that every cell in your body has the same DNA?**

Chromosomes, like those shown here, must form prior to cell division, to
ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic
material. Essentially, each new cell receives half of each "X-shaped"
chromosome.

### Chromosomes {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tZXM._33-k13}

In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus divides before the cell itself divides.
The process in which the nucleus divides is called mitosis. Before
mitosis occurs, a cell’s DNA is replicated. This is necessary so that
each daughter cell will have a complete copy of the genetic material
from the parent cell. How is the replicated DNA sorted and separated so
that each daughter cell gets a complete set of the genetic material? To
understand how this happens, you need to know more about chromosomes.

**Chromosomes** are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins.
Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell
division. It is this coiled structure that ensures proper segregation of
the chromosomes during cell division. During other phases of the cell
cycle, DNA is not coiled into chromosomes. Instead, it exists as a
grainy material called **chromatin** .

The vocabulary of DNA: chromosomes, chromatids, chromatin,
transcription, translation, and replication is discussed at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9HPNwXd9fk](watch?v=s9HPNwXd9fk)

#### Chromatids and the Centromere {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21hdGlkcyBhbmQgdGhlIENlbnRyb21lcmU._33-lpw}

DNA condenses and coils into the familiar X-shaped form of a chromosome,
shown in **Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTA2LUNocm9tb3NvbWU.)
, only after it has replicated. (You can watch DNA coiling into a
chromosome at the link below.) Because DNA has already replicated, each
chromosome actually consists of two identical copies. The two copies are
called sister **chromatids** . They are attached to one another at a
region called the **centromere** . A remarkable animation can be viewed

</div>

#### Chromosomes and Genes {#3.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tZXMgYW5kIEdlbmVz_33-x97}

The DNA of a chromosome is encoded with genetic instructions for making
proteins. These instructions are organized into units called **genes** .
Most genes contain the instructions for a single protein. There may be
hundreds or even thousands of genes on a single chromosome.

#### Human Chromosomes {#3.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gQ2hyb21vc29tZXM._33-w12}

Human cells normally have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited
from each parent. There are 23 chromosomes in each set, for a total of
46 chromosomes per cell. Each chromosome in one set is matched by a
chromosome of the same type in the other set, so there are actually 23
pairs of chromosomes per cell. Each pair consists of chromosomes of the
same size and shape that also contain the same genes. The chromosomes in
a pair are known as **homologous chromosomes** .

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-4zt}

-   Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins.
-   Chromosomes form after DNA replicates; prior to replication, DNA
    exists as chromatin.

**What is meant by the "division of the nucleus"?**

What do you think this colorful picture shows? If you guessed that it’s
a picture of a cell undergoing cell division, you are right. But more
specifically, the image is a lung cell stained with fluorescent dyes
undergoing mitosis, during early anaphase.

### Mitosis and Cytokinesis {#3.html#x-ck12-TWl0b3NpcyBhbmQgQ3l0b2tpbmVzaXM._34-dwv}

During **mitosis** , when the nucleus divides, the two chromatids that

poles of the cell. This is shown in **Figure**

**Figure 3.60**

Mitosis is the phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle that occurs between
DNA replication and the formation of two daughter cells. What happens
during mitosis?

</div>

Mitosis actually occurs in four phases. The phases are called prophase,
metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. They are shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTA4LU1pdG9zaXMtZmxvd2NoYXJ0) and
described in greater detail in the following sections.

in which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides.

</div>

#### Prophase {#3.html#x-ck12-UHJvcGhhc2U._34-shl}

The first and longest phase of mitosis is **prophase** . During
prophase, chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the nuclear
envelope, or membrane, breaks down. In animal cells, the **centrioles**
near the nucleus begin to separate and move to opposite poles (sides) of
the cell. As the centrioles move, a **spindle** starts to form between
them. The spindle, shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTA5LVNwaW5kbGUtYW5kLWNocm9tYXRpZHM.) ,
consists of fibers made of microtubules.

</div>

#### Metaphase {#3.html#x-ck12-TWV0YXBoYXNl_34-ct4}

During **metaphase** , spindle fibers attach to the centromere of each
pair of sister chromatids (see **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTEwLU1ldGFwaGFzZS1EaWFncmFt) ). The
sister chromatids line up at the equator, or center, of the cell. This
is also known as the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers ensure that
sister chromatids will separate and go to different daughter cells when
the cell divides.

</div>

#### Anaphase {#3.html#x-ck12-QW5hcGhhc2U._34-h5t}

During **anaphase** , sister chromatids separate and the centromeres
divide. The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the
spindle fibers. This is like reeling in a fish by shortening the fishing
line. One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell, and the other
sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole. At the end of anaphase,
each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes.

#### Telophase {#3.html#x-ck12-VGVsb3BoYXNl_34-8qd}

During **telophase** , the chromosomes begin to uncoil and form
chromatin. This prepares the genetic material for directing the
metabolic activities of the new cells. The spindle also breaks down, and
new nuclear membranes (nuclear envelope) form.

#### Cytokinesis {#3.html#x-ck12-Q3l0b2tpbmVzaXM._34-qpy}

Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in eukaryotes as well as
prokaryotes. During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm splits in two and the
cell divides. Cytokinesis occurs somewhat differently in plant and
animal cells, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTExLUN5dG9raW5lc2lz) . In animal cells,
the plasma membrane of the parent cell pinches inward along the cell’s
equator until two daughter cells form. In plant cells, a cell plate
forms along the equator of the parent cell. Then, a new plasma membrane
and cell wall form along each side of the cell plate.

**One parent or two?**

That is the main difference between sexual and asexual reproduction.
Sexual reproduction just means combining genetic material from two
parents. Asexual reproduction produces offspring genetically identical
to the one parent.

### Reproduction: Asexual vs. Sexual {#3.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uOiBBc2V4dWFsIHZzLiBTZXh1YWw._35-wjq}

**Cell division** is how organisms grow and repair themselves. It is
also how many organisms produce offspring. For many single-celled
organisms, reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply
divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. In
many other organisms, two parents are involved, and the offspring are
not identical to the parents. In fact, each offspring is unique. Look at
the family in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTEyLUZhbWlseQ..) . The children resemble
their parents, but they are not identical to them. Instead, each has a
unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents.

</div>

**Reproduction** is the process by which organisms give rise to
offspring. It is one of the defining characteristics of living things.
There are two basic types of reproduction: asexual reproduction and
sexual reproduction.

#### Asexual Reproduction {#3.html#x-ck12-QXNleHVhbCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._35-fxp}

**Asexual reproduction** involves a single parent. It results in
offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the
parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There
are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include
binary fission, fragmentation, and budding.

-   **Binary fission** occurs when a parent cell splits into two
    identical daughter cells of the same size.
-   **Fragmentation** occurs when a parent organism breaks into
    fragments, or pieces, and each fragment develops into a
    new organism. Starfish, like the one in **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTAzLVN0YXJmaXNoLXllYXN0LWNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..)
    , reproduce this way. A new starfish can develop from a single ray,
    or arm. Starfish, however, are also capable of sexual reproduction.
-   **Budding** occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The
    bud stays attached to the parent cell while it grows and develops.
    When the bud is fully developed, it breaks away from the parent cell
    and forms a new organism. Budding in yeast is shown in **Figure**
    [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTAzLVN0YXJmaXNoLXllYXN0LWNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..) .

**Figure 3.67**

Binary Fission in various single-celled organisms (left). Cell division
is a relatively simple process in many single-celled organisms.
Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical
daughter cells. In multiple fission (right), a multinucleated cell can
divide to form more than one daughter cell. Multiple fission is more
often observed among protists.

**Figure 3.68**

Starfish reproduce by fragmentation and yeasts reproduce by budding.
Both are types of asexual reproduction.

</div>

Asexual reproduction can be very rapid. This is an advantage for many
organisms. It allows them to crowd out other organisms that reproduce
more slowly. Bacteria, for example, may divide several times per hour.
Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of
bacterial cells in just a few hours! However, most bacteria do not live
under ideal conditions. If they did, the entire surface of the planet
would soon be covered with them. Instead, their reproduction is kept in
check by limited resources, predators, and their own wastes. This is
true of most other organisms as well.

#### Sexual Reproduction {#3.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._35-7ip}

**Sexual reproduction** involves two parents. As you can see from
**Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTE1LVNleHVhbC1SZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tQ3ljbGU.)
, in sexual reproduction, parents produce reproductive cells—called
**gametes** —that unite to form an offspring. Gametes are **haploid**
cells. This means they contain only half the number of chromosomes found
in other cells of the organism. Gametes are produced by a type of cell
division called **meiosis** , which is described in detail in a
subsequent concept. The process in which two gametes unite is called
**fertilization** . The fertilized cell that results is referred to as a
**zygote** . A zygote is **diploid** cell, which means that it has twice
the number of chromosomes as a gamete.

Cycle of Sexual Reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the
production of haploid gametes by meiosis. This is followed by
fertilization and the formation of a diploid zygote. The number of
chromosomes in a gamete is represented by the letter n. Why does the
zygote have 2n, or twice as many, chromosomes?

-   Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces offspring that
    are genetically identical to each other and to the parent.
-   Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces offspring that
    are genetically unique.

**How do you make a cell with half the DNA?**

Meiosis. This allows cells to have half the number of chromosomes, so
two of these cells can come back together to form a new organism with
the complete number of chromosomes. This process not only helps produce
gametes, it also ensures genetic variation.

### Meiosis {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVpb3Npcw.._36-jr3}

The process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis. **Meiosis** is a
type of cell division in which the number of chromosomes is reduced by
half. It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms. During
meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate, and **haploid** cells form
that have only one chromosome from each pair. Two cell divisions occur
during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two
cell divisions are called meiosis I and meiosis II. The overall process
of meiosis is summarized in **Figure**

#### Phases of Meiosis {#3.html#x-ck12-UGhhc2VzIG9mIE1laW9zaXM._36-zlc}

Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell
cycle. In both meiosis I and meiosis II, cells go through the same four
phases as mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase.
However, there are important differences between meiosis I and mitosis.

Compare meiosis I in this flowchart with the figure from the *Mitosis

at the beginning of meiosis (prophase I), homologous chromosomes
exchange segments of DNA. This is known as **crossing-over** , and is
unique to this phase of meiosis.

#### Meiosis I {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVpb3NpcyBJ_36-wxn}

1.  Prophase I: The nuclear envelope begins to break down, and the
    chromosomes condense. Centrioles start moving to opposite poles of
    the cell, and a spindle begins to form. Importantly, **homologous
    chromosomes** pair up, which is unique to prophase I. In prophase of
    mitosis and meiosis II, homologous chromosomes do not form pairs in
    this way. Crossing-over occurs during this phase (see the *Genetic
    Variation* concept).
2.  Metaphase I: Spindle fibers attach to the paired
    homologous chromosomes. The paired chromosomes line up along the
    equator (middle) of the cell. This occurs only in metaphase I. In
    metaphase of mitosis and meiosis II, it is sister chromatids that
    line up along the equator of the cell.
3.  Anaphase I: Spindle fibers shorten, and the chromosomes of each
    homologous pair start to separate from each other. One chromosome of
    each pair moves toward one pole of the cell, and the other
    chromosome moves toward the opposite pole.
4.  Telophase I and Cytokinesis: The spindle breaks down, and new
    nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm of the cell divides, and two
    haploid daughter cells result. The daughter cells each have a random
    assortment of chromosomes, with one from each homologous pair. Both
    daughter cells go on to meiosis II. The DNA does not replicate
    between meiosis I and meiosis II.

#### Meiosis II {#3.html#x-ck12-TWVpb3NpcyBJ_36SQ..-xnu}

1.  Prophase II: The nuclear envelope breaks down and the spindle begins
    to form in each haploid daughter cell from meiosis I. The centrioles
    also start to separate.
2.  Metaphase II: Spindle fibers line up the sister chromatids of each
    chromosome along the equator of the cell.
3.  Anaphase II: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles.
4.  Telophase II and Cytokinesis: The spindle breaks down, and new
    nuclear membranes form. The cytoplasm of each cell divides, and four
    haploid cells result. Each cell has a unique combination
    of chromosomes.

**What's the biggest cell on Earth?**

The ostrich egg - unfertilized, of course. Yes, this egg, just like a
human ovum, is just one cell. The egg shell membrane encloses the
nucleus containing the genetic material and the cytoplasm.

### Gametogenesis {#3.html#x-ck12-R2FtZXRvZ2VuZXNpcw.._37-nh9}

At the end of meiosis, four haploid cells have been produced, but the
cells are not yet gametes. The cells need to develop before they become
mature gametes capable of fertilization. The development of haploid
cells into gametes is called **gametogenesis** .

**Figure 3.72**

How much DNA is in a gamete? The sperm cell forms by meiosis and
spermatogenesis. Because it forms by meiosis, the sperm cell has only
half as much DNA as a body cell. Notice the three distinct segments: a
head piece, a flagella tail and a midpiece of mostly mitochondria. What
is the role of each section?

</div>

Gametogenesis may differ between males and females. Male gametes are
called **sperm** . Female gametes are called **eggs** . In human males,
for example, the process that produces mature sperm cells is called
**spermatogenesis** . During this process, sperm cells grow a tail and
gain the ability to “swim,” like the human sperm cell shown in
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTE4LXNwZXJtLWFuZC1lZ2c.) . In
human females, the process that produces mature eggs is called
**oogenesis** . Just one egg is produced from the four haploid cells
that result from meiosis. The single egg is a very large cell, as you
can see from the human egg in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA1LTE4LXNwZXJtLWFuZC1lZ2c.) .

What process is shown in this photograph? Notice the sperm with the head

#### Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis {#3.html#x-ck12-U3Blcm1hdG9nZW5lc2lzIGFuZCBPb2dlbmVzaXM._37-137}

During spermatogenesis, primary **spermatocytes** go through the first
cell division of meiosis to produce secondary spermatocytes. These are
haploid cells. Secondary spermatocytes then quickly complete the meiotic
division to become **spermatids** , which are also haploid cells. The
four haploid cells produced from meiosis develop a flagellum tail and
compact head piece to become mature sperm cells, capable of swimming and
fertilizing an egg. The compact head, which has lost most of its
cytoplasm, is key in the formation of a streamlined shape. The middle
piece of the sperm, connecting the head to the tail, contains many
mitochondria, providing energy to the cell. The sperm cell essentially
contributes only DNA to the zygote.

On the other hand, the egg provides the other half of the DNA, but also
organelles, building blocks for compounds such as proteins and nucleic
acids, and other necessary materials. The egg, being much larger than a
sperm cell, contains almost all of the cytoplasm a developing embryo
will have during its first few days of life. Therefore, oogenesis is a
much more complicated process than spermatogenesis.

Oogenesis begins before birth and is not completed until after
fertilization. Oogenesis begins when **oogonia** (singular, oogonium),
which are the immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth and
have the diploid number of chromosomes, undergo mitosis to form primary
**oocytes** , also with the diploid number. Oogenesis proceeds as a
primary oocyte undergoes the first cell division of meiosis to form
secondary oocytes with the haploid number of chromosomes. A secondary
oocyte only undergoes the second meiotic cell division to form a haploid
ovum if it is fertilized by a sperm. The one egg cell that results from
meiosis contains most of the cytoplasm, nutrients, and organelles. This
unequal distribution of materials produces one large cell, and one cell
with little more than DNA. This other cell, known as a **polar body** ,
eventually breaks down. The larger cell undergoes meiosis II, once again
producing a large cell and a polar body. The large cell develops into
the mature gamete, called an **ovum** ( **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-T09nZW5lc2lzMQ..) ). The unequal distribution of
the cytoplasm during oogenesis is necessary as the zygote that results
from fertilization receives all of its cytoplasm from the egg. So the
egg needs to have as much cytoplasm as possible.

**What helps ensure the survival of a species?**

Genetic variation. It is this variation that is the essence of
evolution. Without genetic differences among individuals, "survival of
the fittest" would not be likely. Either all survive, or all perish.

### Genetic Variation {#3.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBWYXJpYXRpb24._38-s7d}

**Sexual reproduction** results in infinite possibilities of genetic
variation. In other words, sexual reproduction results in offspring that
are genetically unique. They differ from both parents and also from each
other. This occurs for a number of reasons.

-   When homologous chromosomes form pairs during prophase I of meiosis
    I, crossing-over can occur. **Crossing-over** is the exchange of
    genetic material between homologous chromosomes. It results in new
    combinations of genes on each chromosome.
-   When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are
    randomly distributed to daughter cells, and different chromosomes
    segregate independently of each other. This called is called
    **independent assortment** . It results in gametes that have unique
    combinations of chromosomes.
-   In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring.
    But which two of the millions of possible gametes will it be? This
    is likely to be a matter of chance. It is obviously another source
    of genetic variation in offspring. This is known as
    **random fertilization.**

All of these mechanisms working together result in an amazing amount of
potential variation. Each human couple, for example, has the potential
to produce more than 64 trillion genetically unique children. No wonder
we are all different!

See *Sources of Variation* at
[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/variation/sources/]() for
additional information.

#### Crossing-Over {#3.html#x-ck12-Q3Jvc3NpbmctT3Zlcg.._38-0nc}

Crossing-over occurs during prophase I, and it is the exchange of
genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous
chromosomes. Recall during prophase I, homologous chromosomes line up in
pairs, gene-for-gene down their entire length, forming a configuration
with four chromatids, known as a **tetrad** . At this point, the
chromatids are very close to each other and some material from two
chromatids switch chromosomes, that is, the material breaks off and
reattaches at the same position on the homologous chromosome (
**Figure** [below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvMDYtMDItMDQ.) ). This exchange of
genetic material can happen many times within the same pair of
homologous chromosomes, creating unique combinations of genes. This
process is also known as **recombination** .

**Figure 3.75**

Crossing-over. A maternal strand of DNA is shown in red. A paternal
strand of DNA is shown in blue. Crossing over produces two chromosomes
that have not previously existed. The process of recombination involves
the breakage and rejoining of parental chromosomes (M, F). This results
in the generation of novel chromosomes (C1, C2) that share DNA from both
parents.

</div>

#### Independent Assortment and Random Fertilization {#3.html#x-ck12-SW5kZXBlbmRlbnQgQXNzb3J0bWVudCBhbmQgUmFuZG9tIEZlcnRpbGl6YXRpb24._38-rwe}

In humans, there are over 8 million configurations in which the
chromosomes can line up during metaphase I of meiosis. It is the
specific processes of meiosis, resulting in four unique haploid cells,
that result in these many combinations. This independent assortment, in
which the chromosome inherited from either the father or mother can sort
into any gamete, produces the potential for tremendous genetic
variation. Together with random fertilization, more possibilities for
genetic variation exist between any two people than the number of
individuals alive today. Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization
of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male. In humans,
over 8 million (2 ^23^ ) chromosome combinations exist in the production
of gametes in both the male and female. A sperm cell, with over 8
million chromosome combinations, fertilizes an egg cell, which also has
over 8 million chromosome combinations. That is over 64 trillion unique
combinations, not counting the unique combinations produced by
crossing-over. In other words, each human couple could produce a child
with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations!

See *How Cells Divide: Mitosis vs. Meiosis* at
[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/divide.html](divide.html) for an
animation comparing the two processes.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._38-xl9}

-   Sexual reproduction has the potential to produce tremendous genetic
    variation in offspring.
-   This variation is due to independent assortment and crossing-over
    during meiosis, and random union of gametes during fertilization.

**Young to old. A life cycle?**

Not in the biological sense. Life cycles describe the amount of DNA
present at a specific stage or time in the life of an organism. Is there
a haploid or diploid amount of DNA? That is the key question.

### Life Cycles {#3.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBDeWNsZXM._39-ywc}

Sexual reproduction occurs in a cycle. Diploid parents produce haploid
gametes that unite and develop into diploid adults, which repeat the
cycle. This series of life stages and events that a sexually reproducing
organism goes through is called its **life cycle** . Sexually
reproducing organisms can have different types of life cycles. Three are
represented in **Figure**
[below](#3.html#x-ck12-QmlvSS0wNS0xOS1zZXh1YWwtbGlmZS1jeWNsZXM.) and
described following sections.

Life cycles can vary in sexually reproducing organisms. Three types of
sexual life cycles are shown here. Do you see how they differ? The
letter *n* indicates haploid stages of the life cycles, and *2n*
indicates diploid stages.

</div>

#### Haploid Life Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-SGFwbG9pZCBMaWZlIEN5Y2xl_39-8wj}

The **haploid life cycle** is the simplest life cycle. It is found in
many single-celled eukaryotic organisms. Organisms with a haploid life
cycle spend the majority of their lives as haploid gametes. When the
haploid gametes fuse, they form a diploid zygote. It quickly undergoes
meiosis to produce more haploid gametes that repeat the life cycle.

#### Diploid Life Cycle {#3.html#x-ck12-RGlwbG9pZCBMaWZlIEN5Y2xl_39-oek}

Organisms with a **diploid life cycle** spend the majority of their
lives as diploid adults. When they are ready to reproduce, they undergo
meiosis and produce haploid gametes. Gametes then unite in fertilization
and form a diploid zygote, which immediately enters G ~1~ of the cell
cycle. Next, the zygote's DNA is replicated. Finally, the processes of
mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells.
Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a
diploid adult and the cycle continues. Can you think of an organism with
a diploid life cycle? ( *Hint:* What type of life cycle do humans have?)

#### Alternation of Generations {#3.html#x-ck12-QWx0ZXJuYXRpb24gb2YgR2VuZXJhdGlvbnM._39-hhm}

Plants, algae, and some protists have a life cycle that alternates
between diploid and haploid phases, known as **alternation of
generations** . In plants, the life cycle alternates between the diploid
sporophyte and haploid gametophyte. Spore forming cells in the diploid
sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce **spores** , a haploid
reproductive cell. Spores can develop into an adult without fusing with
another cell. The spores give rise to a multicellular haploid
**gametophyte** , which produce gametes by mitosis. The gametes fuse,
producing a diploid zygote, which grow into the diploid sporophyte.
These life cycles may be quite complicated. You can read about them in
additional concepts.

### Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._39-qxk}

-   A life cycle is the sequence of stages an organisms goes through
    from one generation to the next. Organisms that reproduce sexually
    can have different types of life cycles, such as haploid or diploid
    life cycles.

## Summary {#3.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-2v6}

The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living
organisms. Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from
its structure to its division. Some organisms contain just one cell, and
others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not.
Some have many organelles, others do not. But all cells are surrounded
by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that
determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and
for many organisms, this energy comes from photosynthesis and cellular
respiration. All cells come from preexisting cells through the process
of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism. The cell
cycle, which includes mitosis, defines the life of an eukaryotic cell.

Genetics - the study of inheritance. Inheritance - the passing of traits
from parents to offspring. How are these traits "passed"? Through DNA -
the genetic material. The *Genetics* chapter will focus on genetics,

**What's so interesting about pea plants?**

These purple-flowered plants are not just pretty to look at. Plants like
these led to a huge leap forward in biology. The plants are common
garden pea plants, and they were studied in the mid-1800s by an Austrian
monk named Gregor Mendel. With his careful experiments, Mendel uncovered
the secrets of heredity, or how parents pass characteristics to their
offspring.

You may not care much about heredity in pea plants, but you probably
care about your own heredity. Mendel’s discoveries apply to you as well
as to peas—and to all other living things that reproduce sexually.

### Mendel and His Pea Plants {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVsIGFuZCBIaXMgUGVhIFBsYW50cw..-v7l}

People have long known that the characteristics of living things are
similar in parents and their offspring. Whether it’s the flower color in
pea plants or nose shape in people, it is obvious that offspring
resemble their parents. However, it wasn’t until the experiments of
Gregor Mendel that scientists understood how characteristics are
inherited. Mendel’s discoveries formed the basis of **genetics** , the
science of heredity. That’s why Mendel is often called the "father of
genetics." It’s not common for a single researcher to have such an
important impact on science. The importance of Mendel’s work was due to
three things: a curious mind, sound scientific methods, and good luck.
You’ll see why when you read about Mendel’s experiments.

Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and grew up on his parents’ farm in
Austria. He did well in school and became a monk. He also went to the
University of Vienna, where he studied science and math. His professors
encouraged him to learn science through experimentation and to use math
to make sense of his results. Mendel is best known for his experiments
with the pea plant *Pisum sativum* (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTAxLUdyZWdvci1NZW5kZWw.) ). You can

#### Blending Theory of Inheritance {#4.html#x-ck12-QmxlbmRpbmcgVGhlb3J5IG9mIEluaGVyaXRhbmNl-uk8}

During Mendel’s time, the blending theory of inheritance was popular.
This is the theory that offspring have a blend, or mix, of the
characteristics of their parents. Mendel noticed plants in his own
garden that weren’t a blend of the parents. For example, a tall plant
and a short plant had offspring that were either tall or short but not
medium in height. Observations such as these led Mendel to question the
blending theory. He wondered if there was a different underlying
principle that could explain how characteristics are inherited. He
decided to experiment with pea plants to find out. In fact, Mendel
experimented with almost 30,000 pea plants over the next several years!
At the following link, you can watch an animation in which Mendel
explains how he arrived at his decision to study inheritance in pea
plants:

.

#### Why Study Pea Plants? {#4.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFN0dWR5IFBlYSBQbGFudHM_-spd}

Why did Mendel choose common, garden-variety pea plants for his
experiments? Pea plants are a good choice because they are fast growing
and easy to raise. They also have several visible characteristics that
may vary. These characteristics, which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTAyLU1lbmRlbC1TZXZlbi1DaGFyYWN0ZXJpc3RpY3M.)
, include seed form and color, flower color, pod form and color,
placement of pods and flowers on stems, and stem length. Each
characteristic has two common values. For example, seed form may be
round or wrinkled, and flower color may be white or purple (violet).

**Figure 4.2**

Mendel investigated seven different characteristics in pea plants. In
this chart, cotyledons refer to the tiny leaves inside seeds. Axial pods
are located along the stems. Terminal pods are located at the ends of
the stems.

</div>

#### Controlling Pollination {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbGxpbmcgUG9sbGluYXRpb24.-jck}

To research how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring,
Mendel needed to control pollination. **Pollination** is the
fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants. **Pollen**
consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. They are
produced by a male flower part called the **anther** (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTAzLVBhcnRzLW9mLWEtZmxvd2Vy) ).
Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same or another flower. The **stigma** is a female part of
a flower. It passes the pollen grains to female gametes in the ovary.

<div id="4.html#x-ck12-NTA2NGMwODVjYjk4ZDQwNDcyMWU3N2Q0MmJjY2RkMDY.-psv"

![Parts of a
flower](ck12_4_files/20150914104255066125.png "Parts of a flower")

**Figure 4.3**

Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants. Each pea plant flower has
both male and female parts. The anther is part of the stamen, the male
structure that produces male gametes (pollen). The stigma is part of the
pistil, the female structure that produces female gametes and guides the
pollen grains to them. The stigma receives the pollen grains and passes
them to the ovary, which contains female gametes.

</div>

Pea plants are naturally self-pollinating. In **self-pollination** ,
pollen grains from anthers on one plant are transferred to stigmas of
flowers on the same plant. Mendel was interested in the offspring of two
different parent plants, so he had to prevent self-pollination. He
removed the anthers from the flowers of some of the plants in his
experiments. Then he pollinated them by hand with pollen from other
parent plants of his choice. When pollen from one plant fertilizes
another plant of the same species, it is called **cross-pollination** .
The offspring that result from such a cross are called **hybrids.**

    characteristics are passed from parents to offspring.

**Peas. Some round and some wrinkled.** ***Why?***

That's what Mendel asked. He noticed peas were always round or wrinkled,
but never anything else. Seed shape was one of the traits Mendel studied
in his first set of experiments.

### Mendel’s First Set of Experiments {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVs4oCZcyBGaXJzdCBTZXQgb2YgRXhwZXJpbWVudHM._1-kl0}

Mendel first experimented with just one characteristic of a pea plant at
a time. He began with flower color. As shown in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA0LUNoYXJ0LVNob3dpbmctb3V0Y29tZS1vZi1NZW5kZWwtZmlyc3QtZXhwZXJpbWVudA..)
, Mendel cross-pollinated purple- and white-flowered parent plants. The
parent plants in the experiments are referred to as the **P** (for
parent) **generation** . You can explore an interactive animation of
Mendel’s first set of experiments at this link:
[http://www2.edc.org/weblabs/Mendel/mendel.html](mendel.html) .

peas](ck12_4_files/20150914104255994364.png "Parental, F1, and F2 generations of peas")

**Figure 4.4**

This diagram shows Mendel's first experiment with pea plants. The F1
generation results from cross-pollination of two parent (P) plants, and
contained all purple flowers. The F2 generation results from
self-pollination of F1 plants, and contained 75% purple flowers and 25%
white flowers. This type of experiment is known as a monohybrid cross.

</div>

#### F1 and F2 Generations {#4.html#x-ck12-RjEgYW5kIEYyIEdlbmVyYXRpb25z_1-pzn}

The offspring of the P generation are called the **F1** (for filial, or
“offspring”) **generation** . As you can see from **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA0LUNoYXJ0LVNob3dpbmctb3V0Y29tZS1vZi1NZW5kZWwtZmlyc3QtZXhwZXJpbWVudA..)
, all of the plants in the F1 generation had purple flowers. None of
them had white flowers. Mendel wondered what had happened to the
white-flower characteristic. He assumed some type of inherited factor
produces white flowers and some other inherited factor produces purple
flowers. Did the white-flower factor just disappear in the F1
generation? If so, then the offspring of the F1 generation—called the
**F2 generation** —should all have purple flowers like their parents.

To test this prediction, Mendel allowed the F1 generation plants to
self-pollinate. He was surprised by the results. Some of the F2
generation plants had white flowers. He studied hundreds of F2
generation plants, and for every three purple-flowered plants, there was
an average of one white-flowered plant.

#### Law of Segregation {#4.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIFNlZ3JlZ2F0aW9u_1-ivp}

Mendel did the same experiment for all seven characteristics. In each
case, one value of the characteristic disappeared in the F1 plants and
then showed up again in the F2 plants. And in each case, 75 percent of
F2 plants had one value of the characteristic and 25 percent had the
other value. Based on these observations, Mendel formulated his first
law of inheritance. This law is called the **law of segregation** . It
states that there are two factors controlling a given characteristic,
one of which dominates the other, and these factors separate and go to
different gametes when a parent reproduces.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-gxb}

-   Mendel first researched one characteristic at a time. This led to
    his law of segregation. This law states that each characteristic is
    controlled by two factors, which separate and go to different
    gametes when an organism reproduces.

**Round and green, round and yellow, wrinkled and green, or wrinkled and
yellow?**

Can two traits be inherited together? Or are all traits inherited
separately? Mendel asked these questions after his first round of
experiments.

### Mendel’s Second Set of Experiments {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVs4oCZcyBTZWNvbmQgU2V0IG9mIEV4cGVyaW1lbnRz_2-pz5}

After observing the results of his first set of experiments, Mendel
wondered whether different characteristics are inherited together. For
example, are purple flowers and tall stems always inherited together? Or
do these two characteristics show up in different combinations in
offspring? To answer these questions, Mendel next investigated two
characteristics at a time. For example, he crossed plants with yellow
round seeds and plants with green wrinkled seeds. The results of this
cross, which is a **dihybrid cross** , are shown in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA1LURpaHlicmlkLUNyb3Nz) .

**Figure 4.5**

This chart represents Mendel's second set of experiments. It shows the
outcome of a cross between plants that differ in seed color (yellow or
green) and seed form (shown here with a smooth round appearance or
wrinkled appearance). The letters R, r, Y, and y represent genes for the
characteristics Mendel was studying. Mendel didn’t know about genes,
however. Genes would not be discovered until several decades later. This
experiment demonstrates that in the F2 generation, 9/16 were round
yellow seeds, 3/16 were wrinkled yellow seeds, 3/16 were round green
seeds, and 1/16 were wrinkled green seeds.

</div>

#### F1 and F2 Generations {#4.html#x-ck12-RjEgYW5kIEYyIEdlbmVyYXRpb25z_2-ykj}

In this set of experiments, Mendel observed that plants in the F1
generation were all alike. All of them had yellow and round seeds like
one of the two parents. When the F1 generation plants self-pollinated,
however, their offspring—the F2 generation—showed all possible
combinations of the two characteristics. Some had green round seeds, for
example, and some had yellow wrinkled seeds. These combinations of
characteristics were not present in the F1 or P generations.

#### Law of Independent Assortment {#4.html#x-ck12-TGF3IG9mIEluZGVwZW5kZW50IEFzc29ydG1lbnQ._2-1r9}

Mendel repeated this experiment with other combinations of
characteristics, such as flower color and stem length. Each time, the
results were the same as those in **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA1LURpaHlicmlkLUNyb3Nz) . The results
of Mendel’s second set of experiments led to his second law. This is the
**law of independent assortment** . It states that factors controlling
different characteristics are inherited independently of each other.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-qhi}

-   After his first set of experiments, Mendel researched two
    characteristics at a time. This led to his law of
    independent assortment. This law states that the factors controlling
    different characteristics are inherited independently of each other.

**Do you look like your parents?**

You probably have some characteristics or traits in common with each of
your parents. Mendel's work provided the basis to understand the passing
of traits from one generation to the next.

### Mendel’s Laws and Genetics {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVs4oCZcyBMYXdzIGFuZCBHZW5ldGljcw.._3-lmy}

You might think that Mendel's discoveries would have made a big impact
on science as soon as he made them. But you would be wrong. Why? Because
Mendel's work was largely ignored. Mendel was far ahead of his time and
working from a remote monastery. He had no reputation among the
scientific community and no previously published work.

Mendel’s work, titled *Experiments in Plant Hybridization* , was
published in 1866, and sent to prominent libraries in several countries,
as well as 133 natural science associations. Mendel himself even sent
carefully marked experiment kits to Karl von Nageli, the leading
botanist of the day. The result - it was almost completely ignored. Von
Nageli instead sent hawkweed seeds to Mendel, which he thought was a
better plant for studying heredity. Unfortunately hawkweed reproduces
asexually, resulting in genetically identical clones of the parent.

Charles Darwin published his landmark book on evolution in 1869, not
long after Mendel had discovered his laws. Unfortunately, Darwin knew
nothing of Mendel's discoveries and didn’t understand heredity. This
made his arguments about evolution less convincing to many people. This
example demonstrates the importance for scientists to communicate the
results of their investigations.

#### Rediscovering Mendel’s Work {#4.html#x-ck12-UmVkaXNjb3ZlcmluZyBNZW5kZWzigJlzIFdvcms._3-ymf}

Mendel’s work was virtually unknown until 1900. In that year, three
different European scientists — named Hugo De Vries, Carl Correns, and
Erich Von Tschermak-Seysenegg — independently arrived at Mendel’s laws.
All three had done experiments similar to Mendel’s. They came to the
same conclusions that he had drawn almost half a century earlier. Only
then was Mendel’s actual work rediscovered.

As scientists learned more about **heredity** - the passing of traits
from parents to offspring - over the next few decades, they were able to
describe Mendel’s ideas about inheritance in terms of genes. In this
way, the field of genetics was born. At the link that follows, you can
watch an animation of Mendel explaining his laws of inheritance in
genetic terms.
[http://www.dnalc.org/view/16182-Animation-4-Some-genes-are-dominant-.html](16182-Animation-4-Some-genes-are-dominant-.html)

#### Genetics of Inheritance {#4.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpY3Mgb2YgSW5oZXJpdGFuY2U._3-4mn}

Today, we known that characteristics of organisms are controlled by
genes on chromosomes (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA2LVBhcnRzLW9mLWEtY2hyb21vc29tZQ..) ).
The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its **locus** . In
sexually reproducing organisms, each individual has two copies of the
same gene, as there are two versions of the same chromosome (
**homologous chromosomes** ). One copy comes from each parent. The gene
for a characteristic may have different versions, but the different
versions are always at the same locus. The different versions are called
**alleles** . For example, in pea plants, there is a purple-flower
allele ( *B* ) and a white-flower allele ( *b* ). Different alleles
account for much of the variation in the characteristics of organisms.

![Chromosome, Gene, Locus,
Allele](ck12_4_files/20150914104256923346.png "Chromosome, Gene, Locus, Allele")

**Figure 4.6**

Chromosome, Gene, Locus, and Allele. This diagram shows how the concepts
of chromosome, gene, locus, and allele are related. What is the
different between a gene and a locus? Between a gene and an allele?

</div>

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different
gametes. Thus, the two alleles for each gene also go to different
gametes. At the same time, different chromosomes assort independently.
As a result, alleles for different genes assort independently as well.
In these ways, alleles are shuffled and recombined in each parent’s
gametes.

#### Genotype and Phenotype {#4.html#x-ck12-R2Vub3R5cGUgYW5kIFBoZW5vdHlwZQ.._3-n7g}

When gametes unite during fertilization, the resulting zygote inherits
two alleles for each gene. One allele comes from each parent. The
alleles an individual inherits make up the individual’s **genotype** .
The two alleles may be the same or different. As shown in **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Zmxvd2VyLWNvbG9yLXBlYXM.) , an organism
with two alleles of the same type ( *BB* or *bb* ) is called a
**homozygote** . An organism with two different alleles ( *Bb* ) is
called a **heterozygote** . This results in three possible genotypes.

  **Alleles**              **Genotypes**            **Phenotypes**
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
                           *BB* (homozygote)        purple flowers
  *B* (purple)             *Bb* (heterozygote)      purple flowers
  *b* (white)              *bb* (homozygote)        white flowers

The expression of an organism’s genotype produces its **phenotype** .
The phenotype refers to the organism’s characteristics, such as purple
or white flowers. As you can see from **Table**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Zmxvd2VyLWNvbG9yLXBlYXM.) , different
genotypes may produce the same phenotype. For example, *BB* and *Bb*
genotypes both produce plants with purple flowers. Why does this happen?
In a *Bb* heterozygote, only the *B* allele is expressed, so the *b*
allele doesn’t influence the phenotype. In general, when only one of two
alleles is expressed in the phenotype, the expressed allele is called
the **dominant** allele. The allele that isn’t expressed is called the
**recessive** allele.

#### How Mendel Worked Backward to Get Ahead {#4.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1lbmRlbCBXb3JrZWQgQmFja3dhcmQgdG8gR2V0IEFoZWFk_3-ypb}

Mendel used hundreds or even thousands of pea plants in each experiment
he did. Therefore, his results were very close to those you would expect
based on the rules of probability (see "Probability and Inheritance"
concept). For example, in one of his first experiments with flower
color, there were 929 plants in the F2 generation. Of these, 705 (76
percent) had purple flowers and 224 (24 percent) had white flowers.
Thus, Mendel’s results were very close to the 75 percent purple and 25
percent white you would expect by the laws of probability for this type
of cross.

Of course, Mendel had only phenotypes to work with. He knew nothing
about genes and genotypes. Instead, he had to work backward from
phenotypes and their percents in offspring to understand inheritance.
From the results of his first set of experiments, Mendel realized that
there must be two factors controlling each of the characteristics he
studied, with one of the factors being dominant to the other. He also
realized that the two factors separate and go to different gametes and
later recombine in the offspring. This is an example of Mendel’s good
luck. All of the characteristics he studied happened to be inherited in
this way.

Mendel also was lucky when he did his second set of experiments. He
happened to pick characteristics that are inherited independently of one
another. We now know that these characteristics are controlled by genes
on nonhomologous chromosomes. What if Mendel had studied characteristics
controlled by genes on homologous chromosomes? Would they be inherited
together? If so, how do you think this would have affected Mendel’s
conclusions? Would he have been able to develop his second law of
inheritance?

To better understand how Mendel interpreted his findings and developed
his laws of inheritance, you can visit the following link. It provides
an animation in which Mendel explains how he came to understand heredity
from his experimental results.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-fta}

-   Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900. Soon after that, genes and
    alleles were discovered. This allowed Mendel’s laws to be stated in
    terms of the inheritance of alleles.
-   The gene for a characteristic may have different versions. These
    different versions of a gene are known as alleles.
-   Alleles for different genes assort independently during meiosis.
-   The alleles an individual inherits make up the
    individual’s genotype. The individual may be homozygous (two of the
    same alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles).
-   The expression of an organism’s genotype produces its phenotype.
-   When only one of two alleles is expressed, the expressed allele is
    the dominant allele, and the allele that isn’t expressed is the
    recessive allele.
-   Mendel used the percentage of phenotypes in offspring to understand
    how characteristics are inherited.

**What are the odds of landing on 25 again?**

Not as high as inheriting an allele from a parent. Probability plays a
big role in determining the chance of inheriting an allele from a
parent. It is similar to tossing a coin. What's the chance of the coin
landing on heads?

### Probability {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmFiaWxpdHk._4-nbh}

Assume you are a plant breeder trying to develop a new variety of plant
that is more useful to humans. You plan to cross-pollinate an
insect-resistant plant with a plant that grows rapidly. Your goal is to
produce a variety of plant that is both insect resistant and fast
growing. What percentage of the offspring would you expect to have both
characteristics? Mendel’s laws can be used to find out. However, to
understand how Mendel’s laws can be used in this way, you first need to
know about probability.

**Probability** is the likelihood, or chance, that a certain event will
occur. The easiest way to understand probability is with coin tosses
(see **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA3LUNvaW4tZmxpcA..) ).
When you toss a coin, the chance of a head turning up is 50 percent.
This is because a coin has only two sides, so there is an equal chance
of a head or tail turning up on any given toss.

**Figure 4.7**

Tossing a Coin. Competitions often begin with the toss of a coin. Why is
this a fair way to decide who goes first? If you choose heads, what is
the chance that the toss will go your way?

</div>

If you toss a coin twice, you might expect to get one head and one tail.
But each time you toss the coin, the chance of a head is still 50
percent. Therefore, it’s quite likely that you will get two or even
several heads (or tails) in a row. What if you tossed a coin ten times?
You would probably get more or less than the expected five heads. For
example, you might get seven heads (70 percent) and three tails (30
percent). The more times you toss the coin, however, the closer you will
get to 50 percent heads. For example, if you tossed a coin 1000 times,
you might get 510 heads and 490 tails.

#### Probability and Inheritance {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmFiaWxpdHkgYW5kIEluaGVyaXRhbmNl_4-pq4}

The same rules of probability in coin tossing apply to the main events
that determine the **genotypes** of offspring. These events are the
formation of gametes during **meiosis** and the union of **gametes**
during fertilization.

#### Probability and Gamete Formation {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmFiaWxpdHkgYW5kIEdhbWV0ZSBGb3JtYXRpb24._4-0zs}

How is gamete formation like tossing a coin? Consider Mendel’s
purple-flowered pea plants again. Assume that a plant is heterozygous
for the flower-color allele, so it has the genotype *Bb* (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA4LUdhbWV0ZS1mb3JtYXRpb24.) ). During
meiosis, homologous chromosomes, and the alleles they carry, segregate
and go to different gametes. Therefore, when the *Bb* pea plant forms
gametes, the *B* and *b* alleles segregate and go to different gametes.
As a result, half the gametes produced by the *Bb* parent will have the
*B* allele and half will have the *b* allele. Based on the rules of
probability, any given gamete of this parent has a 50 percent chance of
having the *B* allele and a 50 percent chance of having the *b* allele.

</div>

#### Probability and Fertilization {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJvYmFiaWxpdHkgYW5kIEZlcnRpbGl6YXRpb24._4-glg}

Which of these gametes joins in fertilization with the gamete of another
parent plant? This is a matter of chance, like tossing a coin. Thus, we
can assume that either type of gamete—one with the *B* allele or one
with the *b* allele—has an equal chance of uniting with any of the
gametes produced by the other parent. Now assume that the other parent
is also *Bb* . If gametes of two *Bb* parents unite, what is the chance
of the offspring having one of each allele like the parents ( *Bb* )?
What is the chance of them having a different combination of alleles
than the parents (either *BB* or *bb* )? To answer these questions,
geneticists use a simple tool called a Punnett square, which is the
focus of the next concept.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-gdb}

-   Probability is the chance that a certain event will occur. For
    example, the probability of a head turning up on any given coin toss
    is 50 percent.
-   Probability can be used to predict the chance of gametes and
    offspring having certain alleles.

**What do you get when you cross an apple and an orange?**

Though the above fruit may not result, it would be nice to
scientifically predict what would result. Predicting the possible
genotypes and phenotypes from a genetic cross is often aided by a
Punnett square.

### Punnett Squares {#4.html#x-ck12-UHVubmV0dCBTcXVhcmVz_5-eb6}

A **Punnett square** is a chart that allows you to easily determine the
expected percentage of different genotypes in the offspring of two
parents. An example of a Punnett square for pea plants is shown in
**Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA5LVB1cnBsZS13aGl0ZS1mbG93ZXJzLXB1bm5ldHQtc3F1YXJl)
. In this example, both parents are **heterozygous** for flower color (
*Bb* ). The **gametes** produced by the male parent are at the top of
the chart, and the gametes produced by the female parent are along the
side. The different possible combinations of **alleles** in their
offspring are determined by filling in the cells of the Punnett square
with the correct letters (alleles). At the link below, you can watch an
animation in which Reginald Punnett, inventor of the Punnett square,
explains the purpose of his invention and how to use it.

![Punnett square cross between two
heterozygotes](ck12_4_files/20150914104257889046.png "Punnett square cross between two heterozygotes")

**Figure 4.9**

This Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygotes, Bb. Do you
know where each letter (allele) in all four cells comes from? Two pea
plants, both heterozygous for flower color, are crossed. The offspring
will show the dominant purple coloration in a 3:1 ratio. Or, about 75%
of the offspring will be purple.

</div>

#### Predicting Offspring Genotypes {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGljdGluZyBPZmZzcHJpbmcgR2Vub3R5cGVz_5-moj}

In the cross shown in **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTA5LVB1cnBsZS13aGl0ZS1mbG93ZXJzLXB1bm5ldHQtc3F1YXJl)
, you can see that one out of four offspring (25 percent) has the
**genotype** *BB* , one out of four (25 percent) has the genotype *bb* ,
and two out of four (50 percent) have the genotype *Bb* . These
percentages of genotypes are what you would expect in any cross between
two heterozygous parents. Of course, when just four offspring are
produced, the actual percentages of genotypes may vary by chance from
the expected percentages. However, if you considered hundreds of such
crosses and thousands of offspring, you would get very close to the
expected results, just like tossing a coin.

#### Predicting Offspring Phenotypes {#4.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGljdGluZyBPZmZzcHJpbmcgUGhlbm90eXBlcw.._5-l2g}

You can predict the percentages of **phenotypes** in the offspring of
this cross from their genotypes. *B* is dominant to *b* , so offspring
with either the *BB* or *Bb* genotype will have the purple-flower
phenotype. Only offspring with the *bb* genotype will have the
white-flower phenotype. Therefore, in this cross, you would expect three
out of four (75 percent) of the offspring to have purple flowers and one
out of four (25 percent) to have white flowers. These are the same
percentages that Mendel got in his first experiment.

#### Determining Missing Genotypes {#4.html#x-ck12-RGV0ZXJtaW5pbmcgTWlzc2luZyBHZW5vdHlwZXM._5-w6q}

A Punnett square can also be used to determine a missing genotype based
on the other genotypes involved in a cross. Suppose you have a parent
plant with purple flowers and a parent plant with white flowers. Because
the *b* allele is recessive, you know that the white-flowered parent
must have the genotype *bb* . The purple-flowered parent, on the other
hand, could have either the *BB* or the *Bb* genotype. The Punnett
square in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTEwLXdoaXRlLWFuZC1wdXJwbGUtcGFyZW50cw..)
shows this cross. The question marks (?) in the chart could be either
*B* or *b* alleles.

**Figure 4.10**

Punnett Square: Cross Between White-Flowered and Purple-Flowered Pea
Plants. This Punnett square shows a cross between a white-flowered pea
plant and a purple-flowered pea plant. Can you fill in the missing
alleles? What do you need to know about the offspring to complete their
genotypes?

</div>

Can you tell what the genotype of the purple-flowered parent is from the
information in the Punnett square? No; you also need to know the
genotypes of the offspring in row 2. What if you found out that two of
the four offspring have white flowers? Now you know that the offspring
in the second row must have the *bb* genotype. One of their *b* alleles
obviously comes from the white-flowered ( *bb* ) parent, because that’s
the only allele this parent has. The other *b* allele must come from the
purple-flowered parent. Therefore, the parent with purple flowers must
have the genotype *Bb* .

#### Punnett Square for Two Characteristics {#4.html#x-ck12-UHVubmV0dCBTcXVhcmUgZm9yIFR3byBDaGFyYWN0ZXJpc3RpY3M._5-hag}

When you consider more than one characteristic at a time, using a
Punnett square is more complicated. This is because many more
combinations of alleles are possible. For example, with two genes each
having two alleles, an individual has four alleles, and these four
alleles can occur in 16 different combinations. This is illustrated for
pea plants in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTExLUNyb3BwZWQtcHVubmV0dA..) . In this
cross, known as a **dihybrid cross** , both parents are heterozygous for
pod color ( *Gg* ) and pod form ( *Ff* ).

**Green, blue, brown, black, hazel, violet, or grey. What color are your
eyes?**

Of course human eyes do not come in multi-color, but they do come in
many colors. How do eyes come in so many colors? That brings us to
complex inheritance patterns, known as non-Mendelian inheritance. Many
times inheritance is more complicated than the simple patterns observed
by Mendel.

### Non-Mendelian Inheritance {#4.html#x-ck12-Tm9uLU1lbmRlbGlhbiBJbmhlcml0YW5jZQ.._6-xs4}

The inheritance of characteristics is not always as simple as it is for
the characteristics that Mendel studied in pea plants. Each
characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that had
two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant to the other.
This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each characteristic.
Each characteristic Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a
different (nonhomologous) chromosome. As a result, each characteristic
was inherited independently of the other characteristics. Geneticists
now know that inheritance is often more complex than this.

A characteristic may be controlled by one gene with two alleles, but the
two alleles may have a different relationship than the simple
dominant-recessive relationship that you have read about so far. For
example, the two alleles may have a codominant or incompletely dominant
relationship. The former is illustrated by the flower in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA2LTEyLVJlZC1hbmQtd2hpdGUtZmxvd2Vy) , and
the latter in **Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvNy0yLTc.) .

#### Codominance {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29kb21pbmFuY2U._6-51o}

**Codominance** occurs when both alleles are expressed equally in the
phenotype of the heterozygote. The red and white flower in the figure
has codominant alleles for red petals and white petals.

**Figure 4.12**

Codominance. The flower has red and white petals because of codominance
of red-petal and white-petal alleles.

</div>

#### Incomplete Dominance {#4.html#x-ck12-SW5jb21wbGV0ZSBEb21pbmFuY2U._6-vfs}

**Incomplete dominance** occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is
somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely
dominant allele does not occur. For example, when red snapdragons (C ^R^
C ^R^ ) are crossed with white snapdragons (C ^W^ C ^W^ ), the F ~1~
hybrids are all pink heterozygotes for flower color (C ^R^ C ^W^ ). The
pink color is an intermediate between the two parent colors. When two F
~1~ (C ^R^ C ^W^ ) hybrids are crossed they will produce red, pink, and
white flowers. The genotype of an organism with incomplete dominance can
be determined from its phenotype ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvNy0yLTc.) ).

Incomplete Dominance. The flower has pink petals because of incomplete
dominance of a red-petal allele and a recessive white-petal allele.

</div>

#### Multiple Alleles {#4.html#x-ck12-TXVsdGlwbGUgQWxsZWxlcw.._6-q51}

Many genes have multiple (more than two) alleles. An example is **ABO
blood type** in humans. There are three common alleles for the gene that
controls this characteristic. The alleles I ^A^ and I ^B^ are dominant
over i. A person who is homozygous recessive ii has type O blood.
Homozygous dominant I ^A^ I ^A^ or heterozygous dominant I ^A^ i have
type A blood, and homozygous dominant I ^B^ I ^B^ or heterozygous
dominant I ^B^ i have type B blood. I ^A^ I ^B^ people have type AB
blood, because the A and B alleles are codominant. Type A and type B
parents can have a type AB child. Type A and type B parents can also
have a child with Type O blood, if they are both heterozygous ( *I ^B^
i* , *I ^A^ i* ).

-   Type A blood: I ^A^ I ^A^ , I ^A^ i
-   Type B blood: I ^B^ I ^B^ , I ^B^ i
-   Type AB blood: I ^A^ I ^B^
-   Type O blood: ii

#### Polygenic Characteristics {#4.html#x-ck12-UG9seWdlbmljIENoYXJhY3RlcmlzdGljcw.._6-yaw}

**Polygenic characteristics** are controlled by more than one gene, and
each gene may have two or more alleles. The genes may be on the same
chromosome or on nonhomologous chromosomes.

-   If the genes are located close together on the same chromosome, they
    are likely to be inherited together. However, it is possible that
    they will be separated by crossing-over during meiosis, in which
    case they may be inherited independently of one another.
-   If the genes are on nonhomologous chromosomes, they may be
    recombined in various ways because of independent assortment.

For these reasons, the inheritance of polygenic characteristics is very
complicated. Such characteristics may have many possible phenotypes.
Skin color and adult height are examples of polygenic characteristics in
humans. Do you have any idea how many phenotypes each characteristic
has?

#### Effects of Environment on Phenotype {#4.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBFbnZpcm9ubWVudCBvbiBQaGVub3R5cGU._6-diq}

Genes play an important role in determining an organism’s
characteristics. However, for many characteristics, the individual’s
phenotype is influenced by other factors as well. Environmental factors,
such as sunlight and food availability, can affect how genes are
expressed in the phenotype of individuals. Here are just two examples:

-   Genes play an important part in determining our adult height.
    However, factors such as poor nutrition can prevent us from
    achieving our full genetic potential.
-   Genes are a major determinant of human skin color. However, exposure
    to ultraviolet radiation can increase the amount of pigment in the
    skin and make it appear darker.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-jbw}

-   Many characteristics have more complex inheritance patterns than
    those studied by Mendel. They are complicated by factors such as
    codominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, and
    environmental influences.

**All these ACGTs. What are they?**

Over three billion of them from a human form the human genome - the
human genetic material - all the information needed to encode a human
being. It would take about 9.5 years to read out loud - without stopping
- the more than three billion pairs of bases in one person's genome.

### The Human Genome {#4.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEh1bWFuIEdlbm9tZQ.._7-jvv}

What makes each one of us unique? You could argue that the environment
plays a role, and it does to some extent. But most would agree that your
parents have something to do with your uniqueness. In fact, it is our
**genes** that make each one of us unique – or at least genetically
unique. We all have the genes that make us human: the genes for skin and
bones, eyes and ears, fingers and toes, and so on. However, we all have
different skin colors, different bone sizes, different eye colors and
different ear shapes. In fact, even though we have the same genes, the
products of these genes work a little differently in most of us. And
that is what makes us unique.

The **human genome** is the **genome** - all the DNA - of *Homo sapiens*
. Humans have about 3 billion bases of information, divided into roughly
20,000 to 22,000 genes, which are spread among non-coding sequences and
distributed among 24 distinct chromosomes (22 **autosomes** plus the X
and Y **sex chromosomes** ) (
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTAxLWh1bWFuLWdlbm9tZQ..) ). The genome
is all of the hereditary information encoded in the DNA, including the
genes and non-coding sequences.

Thanks to the **Human Genome Project** , scientists now know the DNA
sequence of the entire human genome. The Human Genome Project is an
international project that includes scientists from around the world. It
began in 1990, and by 2003, scientists had sequenced all 3 billion base
pairs of human DNA. Now they are trying to identify all the genes in the
sequence. The Human Genome Project has produced a reference sequence of
the human genome. The human genome consists of protein-coding **exons**
, associated **introns** and regulatory sequences, genes that encode
other RNA molecules, and other DNA sequences (sometimes referred to as
"junk" DNA), which are regions in which no function as yet been
identified.

#### ENCODE: The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements {#4.html#x-ck12-RU5DT0RFOiBUaGUgRW5jeWNsb3BlZGlhIG9mIEROQSBFbGVtZW50cw.._7-xho}

In September 2012, ENCODE, The **Enc** yclopedia **o** f **D** NA **E**
lements, was announced. ENCODE was a colossal project, involving over
440 scientists in 32 labs the world-over, whose goal was to understand
the human genome. It had been thought that about 80% of the human genome
was "junk" DNA. ENCODE has established that this is not true. Now it is
thought that about 80% of the genome is active. In fact, much of the
human genome is regulatory sequences, on/off switches that tell our
genes what to do and when to do it. Dr. Eric Green, director of the
National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of
Health which organized this project, states, "It's this incredible
choreography going on, of a modest number of genes and an immense number
of ... switches that are choreographing how those genes are used."

It is now thought that at least three-quarters of the genome is involved
in making RNA, and most of this RNA appears to help regulate gene
activity. Scientists have also identified about 4 million sites where
proteins bind to DNA and act in a regulatory capacity. These new
findings demonstrate that the human genome has remarkable and precise,
and complex, controls over the expression of genetic information within
a cell.

**Coiled bundles of DNA and proteins, containing hundreds or thousands
of genes. What are these things?**

Chromosomes. These ensure that each cell receives the proper amount of
DNA during cell division. And usually people have 46 of them, 23 from
each parent.

### Chromosomes and Genes {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tZXMgYW5kIEdlbmVz_8-4q9}

Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. **Chromosomes**
are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins called **histones** (
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvOS0xLTI.) ). Chromosomes are the
form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division. See the
"Chromosomes" section for additional information.

**Figure 4.17**

Human Chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Pairs 1-22 are
autosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y
chromosome.

</div>

#### Autosomes {#4.html#x-ck12-QXV0b3NvbWVz_8-ql6}

Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, 22 pairs are autosomes (numbers
1–22 in **Figure**
[above](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTAzLWh1bWFuLWNocm9tb3NvbWVz) ).
**Autosomes** are chromosomes that contain genes for characteristics
that are unrelated to sex. These chromosomes are the same in males and
females. The great majority of human genes are located on autosomes. At
the link below, you can click on any human chromosome to see which
traits its genes control.
[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human\_Genome/posters/chromosome/chooser.shtml](chooser.shtml)

#### Sex Chromosomes {#4.html#x-ck12-U2V4IENocm9tb3NvbWVz_8-ato}

The remaining pair of human chromosomes consists of the **sex
chromosomes** , X and Y. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have
one X and one Y chromosome. In females, one of the X chromosomes in each
cell is inactivated and known as a Barr body. This ensures that females,
like males, have only one functioning copy of the X chromosome in each
cell.

As you can see from **Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvOS0xLTI.) and
**Figure** [above](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTAzLWh1bWFuLWNocm9tb3NvbWVz)
, the X chromosome is much larger than the Y chromosome. The X
chromosome has about 2,000 genes, whereas the Y chromosome has fewer
than 100, none of which are essential to survival. (For comparison, the
smallest autosome, chromosome 22, has over 500 genes.) Virtually all of
the X chromosome genes are unrelated to sex. Only the Y chromosome
contains genes that determine sex. A single Y chromosome gene, called
**SRY** (which stands for sex-determining region Y gene), triggers an
embryo to develop into a male. Without a Y chromosome, an individual
develops into a female, so you can think of female as the default sex of
the human species. Can you think of a reason why the Y chromosome is so
much smaller than the X chromosome? At the link that follows, you can
watch an animation that explains why:
[http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/gender/Y\_evolution.html](Y_evolution.html)
.

#### Human Genes {#4.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gR2VuZXM._8-wub}

Humans have an estimated 20,000 to 22,000 genes. This may sound like a
lot, but it really isn’t. Far simpler species have almost as many genes
as humans. However, human cells use splicing and other processes to make
multiple proteins from the instructions encoded in a single gene. Of the
3 billion base pairs in the human genome, only about 25 percent make up
genes and their regulatory elements. The functions of many of the other
base pairs are still unclear. To learn more about the coding and
noncoding sequences of human DNA, watch the animation at this link:
[http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/dna/DNAi\_coding\_sequences.html](DNAi_coding_sequences.html)
.

The majority of human genes have two or more possible **alleles** ,
which are alternative forms of a gene. Differences in alleles account
for the considerable genetic variation among people. In fact, most human
genetic variation is the result of differences in individual DNA bases
within alleles.

### Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-fkd}

-   Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Of these, 22 pairs
    are autosomes.
-   The X and Y chromosomes are the sex chromosomes. Females have two X
    chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y.
-   Human chromosomes contain a total of 20,000 to 22,000 genes, the

**What does it mean to be linked?**

For a pair of hands, the above image may suggest a certain type of
linkage. For genes, it might suggest that they are very hard to
separate.

### Linkage {#4.html#x-ck12-TGlua2FnZQ.._9-2qa}

Genes that are located on the same chromosome are called **linked
genes** . Alleles for these genes tend to segregate together during
meiosis, unless they are separated by crossing-over. **Crossing-over**
occurs when two homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during
meiosis I. The closer together two genes are on a chromosome, the less
likely their alleles will be separated by crossing-over. At the
following link, you can watch an animation showing how genes on the same
chromosome may be separated by crossing-over:
[http://www.biostudio.com/d\_%20Meiotic%20Recombination%20Between%20Linked%20Genes.htm](d_%20Meiotic%20Recombination%20Between%20Linked%20Genes.htm)
.

Linkage explains why certain characteristics are frequently inherited
together. For example, genes for hair color and eye color are linked, so
certain hair and eye colors tend to be inherited together, such as
blonde hair with blue eyes and brown hair with brown eyes. What other
human traits seem to occur together? Do you think they might be
controlled by linked genes?

#### Sex-Linked Genes {#4.html#x-ck12-U2V4LUxpbmtlZCBHZW5lcw.._9-cks}

Genes located on the sex chromosomes are called **sex-linked genes** .
Most sex-linked genes are on the X chromosome, because the Y chromosome
has relatively few genes. Strictly speaking, genes on the X chromosome
are **X-linked genes** , but the term sex-linked is often used to refer
to them.

Sex-linked traits are discussed at

#### Mapping Linkage {#4.html#x-ck12-TWFwcGluZyBMaW5rYWdl_9-dk0}

Linkage can be assessed by determining how often crossing-over occurs
between two genes on the same chromosome. Genes on different
(nonhomologous) chromosomes are not linked. They assort independently
during meiosis, so they have a 50 percent chance of ending up in
different gametes. If genes show up in different gametes less than 50
percent of the time (that is, they tend to be inherited together), they
are assumed to be on the same (homologous) chromosome. They may be
separated by crossing-over, but this is likely to occur less than 50
percent of the time. The lower the frequency of crossing-over, the
closer together on the same chromosome the genes are presumed to be.
Frequencies of crossing-over can be used to construct a linkage map like
the one in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTA0LUxpbmthZ2UtbWFw) . A **linkage map**
shows the locations of genes on a chromosome.

-   Sex-linked genes are located on a sex chromosome, and X-linked genes
    are located on the X chromosome.

**What number can you see?**

Red-green colorblindness is a common inherited trait in humans. About 1
in 10 men have some form of color blindness, however, very few women are
color blind. Why?

### Mendelian Inheritance in Humans {#4.html#x-ck12-TWVuZGVsaWFuIEluaGVyaXRhbmNlIGluIEh1bWFucw.._10-b9w}

Characteristics that are encoded in DNA are called **genetic traits** .
Different types of human traits are inherited in different ways. Some
human traits have simple inheritance patterns like the traits that
Gregor Mendel studied in pea plants. Other human traits have more
complex inheritance patterns.

Mendelian inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits controlled by
a single gene with two alleles, one of which may be dominant to the
other. Not many human traits are controlled by a single gene with two
alleles, but they are a good starting point for understanding human
heredity. How Mendelian traits are inherited depends on whether the
traits are controlled by genes on autosomes or the X chromosome.

#### Autosomal Traits {#4.html#x-ck12-QXV0b3NvbWFsIFRyYWl0cw.._10-3vo}

Autosomal traits are controlled by genes on one of the 22 human
autosomes. Consider earlobe attachment. A single autosomal gene with two
alleles determines whether you have attached earlobes or free-hanging
earlobes. The allele for free-hanging earlobes ( *F* ) is dominant to
the allele for attached earlobes ( *f* ). Other single-gene autosomal
traits include widow’s peak and hitchhiker’s thumb. The dominant and
recessive forms of these traits are shown in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTA1LUVhcmxvYmUtYXR0YWNobWVudA..) . Which
form of these traits do you have? What are your possible genotypes for
the traits?

The chart in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTA1LUVhcmxvYmUtYXR0YWNobWVudA..) is
called a **pedigree** . It shows how the earlobe trait was passed from
generation to generation within a family. Pedigrees are useful tools for
studying inheritance patterns.

You can watch a video explaining how pedigrees are used and what they
reveal at this link:

#### Sex-Linked Traits {#4.html#x-ck12-U2V4LUxpbmtlZCBUcmFpdHM._10-twi}

Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called
**sex-linked traits** , or **X-linked traits** in the case of the X
chromosome. Single-gene X-linked traits have a different pattern of
inheritance than single-gene autosomal traits. Do you know why? It’s
because males have just one X chromosome. In addition, they always
inherit their X chromosome from their mother, and they pass it on to all
their daughters but none of their sons. This is illustrated in
**Figure** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTA3LVNleC1DZWxscw..) .

<div id="4.html#x-ck12-YmRjMjc2MWZlOTVhOTlhYjJjYWYyMTExYjYxM2M4ODA.-uyv"

**Figure 4.21**

Inheritance of Sex Chromosomes. Mothers pass only X chromosomes to their
children. Fathers always pass their X chromosome to their daughters and
their Y chromosome to their sons. Can you explain why fathers always
determine the sex of the offspring?

</div>

Because males have just one X chromosome, they have only one allele for
any X-linked trait. Therefore, a recessive X-linked allele is always
expressed in males. Because females have two X chromosomes, they have
two alleles for any X-linked trait. Therefore, they must inherit two
copies of the recessive allele to express the recessive trait. This
explains why X-linked recessive traits are less common in females than
males. An example of a recessive X-linked trait is **red-green color
blindness** . People with this trait cannot distinguish between the
colors red and green. More than one recessive gene on the X chromosome
codes for this trait, which is fairly common in males but relatively
rare in females ( **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTA4LWNvbG9yYmxpbmRuZXNzLXBlZGlncmVl) ).

**Is being short-statured inherited?**

It can be. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism in humans,
and it is caused by a dominant mutation. The mutation can be passed from
one generation to the next.

### Genetic Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBEaXNvcmRlcnM._11-vd8}

Many **genetic disorders** are caused by mutations in one or a few
genes. Other genetic disorders are caused by abnormal numbers of
chromosomes.

#### Genetic Disorders Caused by Mutations {#4.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBEaXNvcmRlcnMgQ2F1c2VkIGJ5IE11dGF0aW9ucw.._11-ymr}

The **Table** [below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Z2VuZXRpYy1kaXNvcmRlcnM.)
lists several genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene.
Some of the disorders are caused by mutations in autosomal genes, others
by mutations in X-linked genes. Which disorder would you expect to be
more common in males than females? You can watch a video about the human
genome, genetic disorders, and mutations at this link:
[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/programs/ht/rv/2809\_03.html](2809_03.html)
.

You can click on any human chromosome at this link to see the genetic
disorders associated with it:

  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------
  Marfan syndrome               defective protein in connective tissue                    heart and bone defects and unusually long, slender limbs and fingers                                      autosomal dominant
  Sickle cell anemia            abnormal hemoglobin protein in red blood cells            sickle-shaped red blood cells that clog tiny blood vessels, causing pain and damaging organs and joints   autosomal recessive
  Vitamin D-resistant rickets   lack of a substance needed for bones to absorb minerals   soft bones that easily become deformed, leading to bowed legs and other skeletal deformities              X-linked dominant
  Hemophilia A                  reduced activity of a protein needed for blood clotting   internal and external bleeding that occurs easily and is difficult to control                             X-linked recessive

Few genetic disorders are controlled by dominant alleles. A mutant
dominant allele is expressed in every individual who inherits even one
copy of it. If it causes a serious disorder, affected people may die
young and fail to reproduce. Therefore, the mutant dominant allele is
likely to die out of the population.

A mutant recessive allele, such as the allele that causes sickle cell
anemia (see **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTExLXJlZC1ibG9vZC1jZWxs) and the link
that follows), is not expressed in people who inherit just one copy of
it. These people are called **carriers** . They do not have the disorder
themselves, but they carry the mutant allele and can pass it to their
offspring. Thus, the allele is likely to pass on to the next generation
rather than die out.

Cystic Fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease are two additional severe genetic
disorders. They are discussed in the following video:

#### Chromosomal Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tYWwgRGlzb3JkZXJz_11-aqm}

Mistakes may occur during meiosis that result in **nondisjunction** .
This is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during meiosis
(the animation at the link below shows how this happens). Some of the
resulting gametes will be missing a chromosome, while others will have
an extra copy of the chromosome. If such gametes are fertilized and form
zygotes, they usually do not survive. If they do survive, the
individuals are likely to have serious genetic disorders. **Table**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YWJub3JtYWwtY2hyb21vc29tZXM.) lists
several genetic disorders that are caused by abnormal numbers of
chromosomes. Most chromosomal disorders involve the X chromosome. Look
back at the X and Y chromosomes and you will see why. The X and Y
chromosomes are very different in size, so nondisjunction of the sex
chromosomes occurs relatively often.

#### Diagnosing Genetic Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-RGlhZ25vc2luZyBHZW5ldGljIERpc29yZGVycw.._11-k0e}

A genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation can be inherited.
Therefore, people with a genetic disorder in their family may be
concerned about having children with the disorder. Professionals known
as **genetic counselors** can help them understand the risks of their
children being affected. If they decide to have children, they may be
advised to have **prenatal** (“before birth”) testing to see if the
fetus has any genetic abnormalities. One method of prenatal testing is
**amniocentesis** . In this procedure, a few fetal cells are extracted
from the fluid surrounding the fetus, and the fetal chromosomes are
examined.

#### Treating Genetic Disorders {#4.html#x-ck12-VHJlYXRpbmcgR2VuZXRpYyBEaXNvcmRlcnM._11-nny}

The symptoms of genetic disorders can sometimes be treated, but cures
for genetic disorders are still in the early stages of development. One
potential cure that has already been used with some success is **gene
therapy** . This involves inserting normal genes into cells with mutant
genes. At the following link, you can watch the video ‘‘Sickle Cell
Anemia: Hope from Gene Therapy’’, to learn how scientists are trying to
cure sickle-cell anemia with gene therapy.

**So how does a scientist work with DNA?**

It always starts with the sequence. Once the sequence is known, so much
more can be done. Specific regions can be isolated, cloned, amplified,
and then used to help us.

### Biotechnology Methods {#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvdGVjaG5vbG9neSBNZXRob2Rz_12-txs}

**Biotechnology** is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup
of living things for human purposes. Generally, the purpose of
biotechnology is to create organisms that are useful to humans or to
cure genetic disorders. For example, biotechnology may be used to create
crops that resist insect pests or yield more food, or to create new
treatments for human diseases.

*Biotechnology: The Invisible Revolution* can be seen at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcG9q9cPqm4](watch?v=OcG9q9cPqm4) .

*What does biotechnology have to do with me?* Is discussed in the
following video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrT5BT\_7HdI](watch?v=rrT5BT_7HdI)
(10:01).

Biotechnology uses a variety of techniques to achieve its aims. Two
commonly used techniques are gene cloning and the polymerase chain
reaction.

#### Gene Cloning {#4.html#x-ck12-R2VuZSBDbG9uaW5n_12-zea}

**Gene cloning** is the process of isolating and making copies of a
gene. This is useful for many purposes. For example, gene cloning might
be used to isolate and make copies of a normal gene for gene therapy.
Gene cloning involves four steps: isolation, ligation, transformation,
and selection. You can watch an interactive animation about gene cloning
at this link:
[http://www.teachersdomain.org/asset/biot09\_int\_geneclone/]() .

1.  In isolation, an enzyme (called a restriction enzyme) is used to
    break DNA at a specific base sequence. This is done to isolate
    a gene.
2.  During **ligation** , the enzyme **DNA ligase** combines the
    isolated gene with plasmid DNA from bacteria. (A **plasmid** is
    circular DNA that is not part of a chromosome and can
    replicate independently.) Ligation is illustrated in **Figure**
    [below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTE0LWxpZ2F0aW9u) . The DNA that
    results is called **recombinant DNA** .
3.  In **transformation** , the recombinant DNA is inserted into a
    living cell, usually a bacterial cell. Changing an organism in this
    way is also called **genetic engineering** .
4.  Selection involves growing transformed bacteria to make sure they
    have the recombinant DNA. This is a necessary step because
    transformation is not always successful. Only bacteria that contain
    the recombinant DNA are selected for further use.

#### Polymerase Chain Reaction {#4.html#x-ck12-UG9seW1lcmFzZSBDaGFpbiBSZWFjdGlvbg.._12-tmf}

The **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** makes many copies of a gene or
other DNA segment. This might be done in order to make large quantities
of a gene for genetic testing. PCR involves three steps: **denaturing**
, **annealing** , and **extension** . The three steps are illustrated in
**Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTE1LVBvbHltZXJhc2UtY2hhaW4tcmVhY3Rpb24.)
. They are repeated many times in a cycle to make large quantities of
the gene. You can watch animations of PCR at these links:

1.  Denaturing involves heating DNA to break the bonds holding together
    the two DNA strands. This yields two single strands of DNA.
2.  Annealing involves cooling the single strands of DNA and mixing them
    with short DNA segments called **primers** . Primers have base
    sequences that are complementary to segments of the single
    DNA strands. As a result, bonds form between the DNA strands
    and primers.
3.  Extension occurs when an enzyme ( **Taq polymerase** or Taq
    DNA polymerase) adds nucleotides to the primers. This produces new
    DNA molecules, each incorporating one of the original DNA strands.

**Why would anyone grow plants like this?**

Developing better crops is a significant aspect of biotechnology. Crops
that are resistant to damage from insects or droughts must have a
significant role in the world's future. And it all starts in the lab.

### Applications of Biotechnology {#4.html#x-ck12-QXBwbGljYXRpb25zIG9mIEJpb3RlY2hub2xvZ3k._13-5c4}

Methods of biotechnology can be used for many practical purposes. They
are used widely in both medicine and agriculture. To see how
biotechnology can be used to solve crimes, watch the video "Justice
DNA—Freeing the Innocent" at the following link:
[http://www.pubinfo.vcu.edu/secretsofthesequence/playlist\_frame.asp](playlist_frame.asp)
.

#### Applications in Medicine {#4.html#x-ck12-QXBwbGljYXRpb25zIGluIE1lZGljaW5l_13-s7t}

In addition to gene therapy for genetic disorders, biotechnology can be
used to transform bacteria so they are able to make human proteins.
**Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTE2LWdlbmV0aWMtRW5naW5lZXJpbmctVGh1bWI.)
shows how this is done to produce a **cytokine** , which is a small
protein that helps fight infections. Proteins made by the bacteria are
injected into people who cannot produce them because of mutations.

Genetically Engineering Bacteria to Produce a Human Protein. Bacteria
can be genetically engineered to produce a human protein, such as a
cytokine. A cytokine is a small protein that helps fight infections.

</div>

**Insulin** was the first human protein to be produced in this way.
Insulin helps cells take up glucose from the blood. People with type 1
diabetes have a mutation in the gene that normally codes for insulin.
Without insulin, their blood glucose rises to harmfully high levels. At
present, the only treatment for type 1 diabetes is the injection of
insulin from outside sources. Until recently, there was no known way to
make insulin outside the human body. The problem was solved by gene
cloning. The human insulin gene was cloned and used to transform
bacterial cells, which could then produce large quantities of human
insulin.

#### Pharmacogenomics {#4.html#x-ck12-UGhhcm1hY29nZW5vbWljcw.._13-eoi}

We know that, thanks to our DNA, each of us is a little bit different.
Some of those differences are obvious, like eye and hair color. Others
are not so obvious, like how our bodies react to medication. Researchers
are beginning to look at how to tailor medical treatments to our genetic
profiles, in a relatively new field called **pharmacogenomics** . Some
of the biggest breakthroughs have been in cancer treatment. For
additional information on this “personalized medicine,” listen to

#### Applications in Agriculture {#4.html#x-ck12-QXBwbGljYXRpb25zIGluIEFncmljdWx0dXJl_13-iyi}

Biotechnology has been used to create transgenic crops. **Transgenic
crops** are genetically modified with new genes that code for traits
useful to humans. The diagram in **Figure**
[below](#4.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA4LTE3LVRyYW5zZ2VuaWMtY3JvcA..) shows how a
transgenic crop is created. You can learn more about how scientists

**Right or wrong? Good or bad? Legal or illegal?**

The completion of The Human Genome Project is one of the most important
scientific events of the past 50 years. However, is knowing all of our
DNA a good thing? The advancement of biotechnology has raised many
interesting ethical, legal and social questions.

### Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues {#4.html#x-ck12-RXRoaWNhbCwgTGVnYWwsIGFuZCBTb2NpYWwgSXNzdWVz_14-olt}

Imagine someone analyzes part of your DNA. Who controls that
information? What if your health insurance company found out you were
predisposed to develop a devastating genetic disease. Might they decide
to cancel your insurance? Privacy issues concerning genetic information
is an important issue in this day and age.

**ELSI** stands for Ethical, Legal and Social Issues. It's a term
associated with the Human Genome project. This project didn't only have
the goal to identify all the genes in the human genome, but also to
address the ELSI that might arise from the project. Rapid advances in
DNA-based research, human genetics, and their applications have resulted
in new and complex ethical and legal issues for society.

#### Concerns from Biotechnology {#4.html#x-ck12-Q29uY2VybnMgZnJvbSBCaW90ZWNobm9sb2d5_14-bpf}

The use of biotechnology has raised a number of ethical, legal, and
social issues. Here are just a few:

-   Who owns genetically modified organisms such as bacteria? Can such
    organisms be patented like inventions?
-   Are genetically modified foods safe to eat? Might they have unknown
    harmful effects on the people who consume them?
-   Are genetically engineered crops safe for the environment? Might
    they harm other organisms or even entire ecosystems?
-   Who controls a person’s genetic information? What safeguards ensure
    that the information is kept private?
-   How far should we go to ensure that children are free of mutations?
    Should a pregnancy be ended if the fetus has a mutation for a
    serious genetic disorder?

Addressing such issues is beyond the scope of this concept. The
following example shows how complex the issues may be:

A strain of corn has been created with a gene that encodes a natural
pesticide. On the positive side, the **transgenic** corn is not eaten by
insects, so there is more corn for people to eat. The corn also doesn’t
need to be sprayed with chemical pesticides, which can harm people and
other living things. On the negative side, the transgenic corn has been
shown to cross-pollinate nearby milkweed plants. Offspring of the
cross-pollinated milkweed plants are now known to be toxic to monarch
butterfly caterpillars that depend on them for food. Scientists are
concerned that this may threaten the monarch species as well as other
species that normally eat monarchs.

As this example shows, the pros of biotechnology may be obvious, but the
cons may not be known until it is too late. Unforeseen harm may be done
to people, other species, and entire ecosystems. No doubt the ethical,
legal, and social issues raised by biotechnology will be debated for
decades to come. For a recent debate about the ethics of applying
biotechnology to humans, watch the video at the link below. In the
video, a Harvard University professor of government and a Princeton
University professor of bioethics debate the science of “perfecting
humans.”

## Summary {#4.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-xwi}

Beginning with Mendel's pea plants, genetics has become one of the most
important fields of biology. Genetics discusses genetics, from Mendel's
pea plants to current ethical issues associated with this field. The
completion of The Human Genome Project is one of the landmark scientific
events of the last 50 years. Human genetics affects many, if not every,
field of medicine. Technologies associated with genetics are involved in
developing products to make our lives better, but have raised a number
of ethical, legal and social issues.

**What molecule determines many of your traits?**

Biology of the Molecule. The *Molecular Biology* chapter focuses on DNA
and proteins, and specifically how the "instructions" in DNA are used to
make proteins. This model depicts a protein binding to DNA. Notice the
"spiral staircase" shape of the DNA molecule, with the globular wrapped
protein around it.

**Is it always DNA to RNA to proteins?**

The central dogma of molecular biology. Coined by Francis Crick. And in
his own words, "I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I
suspect. I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence
hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption
was more central and more powerful."

### Central Dogma of Molecular Biology {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2VudHJhbCBEb2dtYSBvZiBNb2xlY3VsYXIgQmlvbG9neQ..-ly7}

Your **DNA** , or deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the genes that
determine who you are. How can this organic molecule control your
characteristics? DNA contains instructions for all the proteins your
body makes. **Proteins** , in turn, determine the structure and function
of all your cells. What determines a protein’s structure? It begins with
the sequence of **amino acids** that make up the protein. Instructions
for making proteins with the correct sequence of amino acids are encoded
in DNA.

DNA is found in chromosomes. In eukaryotic cells, chromosomes always
remain in the nucleus, but proteins are made at ribosomes in the
cytoplasm. How do the instructions in DNA get to the site of protein
synthesis outside the nucleus? Another type of nucleic acid is
responsible. This nucleic acid is **RNA** , or ribonucleic acid. RNA is
a small molecule that can squeeze through pores in the nuclear membrane.
It carries the information from DNA in the nucleus to a ribosome in the
cytoplasm and then helps assemble the protein. In short:

**DNA → RNA → Protein**

Discovering this sequence of events was a major milestone in molecular
biology. It is called the **central dogma of molecular biology** . You
can watch a video about the central dogma and other concepts in this
lesson at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjRCmU0\_dhY](watch?v=ZjRCmU0_dhY)
(8:07).

The vocabulary of DNA, including the two processes involved in the
central dogma, **transcription** and **translation** , is discussed at

(10:46).

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-vf5}

-   The central dogma of molecular biology states that DNA contains
    instructions for making a protein, which are copied by RNA.
-   RNA then uses the instructions to make a protein.
-   In short: DNA → RNA → Protein, or DNA to RNA to Protein.

**The spiral structure in the picture is a large organic molecule. What
type of organic molecule is it?**

Here’s a hint: molecules like this one determine who you are. They
contain genetic information that controls your characteristics. They
determine your eye color, facial features, and other physical
attributes. What molecule is it?

You probably answered "DNA." Today, it is commonly known that DNA is the
genetic material. For a long time, scientists knew such molecules
existed. They were aware that genetic information was contained within
organic molecules. However, they didn’t know which type of molecules
play this role. In fact, for many decades, scientists thought that
proteins were the molecules that carry genetic information. In this
section, you will learn how scientists discovered that DNA carries the
code of life.

### DNA, the Genetic Material {#5.html#x-ck12-RE5BLCB0aGUgR2VuZXRpYyBNYXRlcmlhbA.._1-7cc}

**DNA** , deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material in your cells.
It was passed on to you from your parents and determines your
characteristics. The discovery that DNA is the genetic material was
another important milestone in molecular biology.

#### Griffith Searches for the Genetic Material {#5.html#x-ck12-R3JpZmZpdGggU2VhcmNoZXMgZm9yIHRoZSBHZW5ldGljIE1hdGVyaWFs_1-i85}

Many scientists contributed to the identification of DNA as the genetic
material. In the 1920s, Frederick Griffith made an important discovery.
He was studying two different strains of a bacterium, called R (rough)
strain and S (smooth) strain. He injected the two strains into mice. The
S strain killed (virulent) the mice, but the R strain did not
(non-virulent) (see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTAxLUdyaWZmaXRocy1FeHBlcmltZW50YWwtUmVzdWx0cw..)
). Griffith also injected mice with S-strain bacteria that had been
killed by heat. As expected, the killed bacteria did not harm the mice.
However, when the dead S-strain bacteria were mixed with live R-strain
bacteria and injected, the mice died.

**Figure 5.1**

Griffith’s Experimental Results. Griffith showed that a substance could
be transferred to harmless bacteria and make them deadly.

</div>

Based on his observations, Griffith deduced that something in the killed
S strain was transferred to the previously harmless R strain, making the
R strain deadly. He called this process **transformation** , as
something was "transforming" the bacteria from one strain into another
strain. What was that something? What type of substance could change the
characteristics of the organism that received it?

#### Avery’s Team Makes a Major Contribution {#5.html#x-ck12-QXZlcnnigJlzIFRlYW0gTWFrZXMgYSBNYWpvciBDb250cmlidXRpb24._1-qbu}

In the early 1940s, a team of scientists led by Oswald Avery tried to
answer the question raised by Griffith’s results. They inactivated
various substances in the S-strain bacteria. They then killed the
S-strain bacteria and mixed the remains with live R-strain bacteria.
(Keep in mind, the R-strain bacteria usually did not harm the mice.)
When they inactivated proteins, the R-strain was deadly to the injected
mice. This ruled out proteins as the genetic material. Why? Even without
the S-strain proteins, the R strain was changed, or transformed, into
the deadly strain. However, when the researchers inactivated DNA in the
S strain, the R strain remained harmless. This led to the conclusion
that DNA is the substance that controls the characteristics of
organisms. In other words, DNA is the genetic material. You can watch an
animation about the research of both Griffith and Avery at this link:
[http://www.dnalc.org/view/16375-Animation-17-A-gene-is-made-of-DNA-.html](16375-Animation-17-A-gene-is-made-of-DNA-.html)
.

#### Hershey and Chase Seal the Deal {#5.html#x-ck12-SGVyc2hleSBhbmQgQ2hhc2UgU2VhbCB0aGUgRGVhbA.._1-xli}

The conclusion that DNA is the genetic material was not widely accepted
at first. It had to be confirmed by other research. In the 1950s, Alfred
Hershey and Martha Chase did experiments with viruses and bacteria.
**Viruses** are not made of cells. They are basically DNA inside a
protein coat. To reproduce, a virus must insert its own genetic material
into a cell (such as a bacterium). Then it uses the cell’s machinery to
make more viruses. The researchers used different radioactive elements
to label the DNA and proteins in viruses. This allowed them to identify
which molecule the viruses inserted into bacteria. DNA was the molecule
they identified. This confirmed that DNA is the genetic material.

**How do these four structures form DNA?**

In an extremely elegant model, that's how. As you will soon see, the
model predicts how the DNA sequence can code for proteins, and how the
molecule can be replicated.

### DNA Structure and Replication {#5.html#x-ck12-RE5BIFN0cnVjdHVyZSBhbmQgUmVwbGljYXRpb24._2-69v}

#### Chargaff's Rules {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmdhZmYncyBSdWxlcw.._2-smd}

Other important discoveries about DNA were made in the mid-1900s by
Erwin Chargaff. He studied DNA from many different species. He was
especially interested in the four different nitrogen bases of DNA:
adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) (see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTAyLW5pdHJvZ2VuLUJhc2VzLWluLUROQQ..) ).
Chargaff found that concentrations of the four bases differed from one
species to another. However, within each species, the concentration of
adenine was always about the same as the concentration of thymine. The
same was true of the concentrations of guanine and cytosine. These
observations came to be known as **Chargaff’s rules** . The significance
of the rules would not be revealed until the structure of DNA was
discovered.

#### The Double Helix {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIERvdWJsZSBIZWxpeA.._2-z9q}

After DNA was found to be the genetic material, scientists wanted to
learn more about it. James Watson and Francis Crick are usually given
credit for discovering that DNA has a **double helix** shape, like a
spiral staircase (see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTAzLVNwaXJhbG5lc3M.) ). The discovery
was based on the prior work of Rosalind Franklin and other scientists,
who had used X rays to learn more about DNA’s structure. Franklin and
these other scientists have not always been given credit for their
contributions. You can learn more about Franklin’s work by watching the
video at this link:

![Compares the shape of a DNA molecule with a spiral
staircase](ck12_5_files/20150914104350590705.jpeg "Compares the shape of a DNA molecule with a spiral staircase")

**Figure 5.3**

The DNA molecule has a double helix shape. This is the same basic shape
as a spiral staircase. Do you see the resemblance? Which parts of the
DNA molecule are like the steps of the spiral staircase?

</div>

The double helix shape of DNA, together with Chargaff’s rules, led to a
better understanding of DNA. DNA, as a nucleic acid, is made from
**nucleotide** monomers, and the DNA double helix consists of two
polynucleotide chains. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar
(deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing base (A, C,
G, or T).

Scientists concluded that bonds (hydrogen bonds) between complementary
bases hold together the two polynucleotide chains of DNA. Adenine always
bonds with its complementary base, thymine. Cytosine always bonds with
its complementary base, guanine. If you look at the nitrogen bases in
**Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTAyLW5pdHJvZ2VuLUJhc2VzLWluLUROQQ..) ,
you will see why. Adenine and guanine have a two-ring structure.
Cytosine and thymine have just one ring. If adenine were to bind with
guanine and cytosine with thymine, the distance between the two DNA
chains would be variable. However, when a one-ring molecule binds with a
two-ring molecule, the distance between the two chains is kept constant.
This maintains the uniform shape of the DNA double helix. These **base
pairs** (A-T or G-C) stick into the middle of the double helix, forming,
in essence, the steps of the spiral staircase.

#### DNA Replication {#5.html#x-ck12-RE5BIFJlcGxpY2F0aW9u_2-zdf}

Knowledge of DNA’s structure helped scientists understand how DNA
replicates. **DNA replication** is the process in which DNA is copied.
It occurs during the synthesis (S) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle.
DNA replication begins when an enzyme, DNA helicase, breaks the bonds
between complementary bases in DNA (see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA0LUROQS1yZXBsaWNhdGlvbg..) ). This
exposes the bases inside the molecule so they can be “read” by another
enzyme, DNA polymerase, and used to build two new DNA strands with
complementary bases, also by DNA polymerase. The two daughter molecules
that result each contain one strand from the parent molecule and one new
strand that is complementary to it. As a result, the two daughter
molecules are both identical to the parent molecule. DNA replication is
a **semi-conservative** process because half of the parent DNA molecule
is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules.

The process of DNA replication is actually much more complex than this
simple summary. You can see a detailed animation of the process at this
link: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mtLXpgjHL0](watch?v=-mtLXpgjHL0)

**How does the information move from the nucleus, where the DNA is
located, to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are?**

RNA, the other nucleic acid, that's how. Specifically mRNA. RNA, the
middle player in the central dogma. This image is an abstract
representation of tRNA. Without tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA, proteins cannot be
made.

### RNA {#5.html#x-ck12-Uk5B_3-ynh}

DNA alone cannot ‘‘tell’’ your cells how to make proteins. It needs the
help of **RNA** , ribonucleic acid, the other main player in the central
dogma of molecular biology. Remember, DNA ‘‘lives’’ in the nucleus, but
proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. How does the
genetic information get from the nucleus to the cytoplasm? RNA is the
answer.

#### RNA vs. DNA {#5.html#x-ck12-Uk5B_3IHZzLiBETkE.-g4t}

RNA, like DNA, is a nucleic acid. However, RNA differs from DNA in
several ways. In addition to being smaller than DNA, RNA also

-   consists of one nucleotide chain instead of two,
-   contains the nitrogen base uracil (U) instead of thymine,
-   contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose.

#### Types of RNA {#5.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUk5B_3-8zs}

There are three main types of RNA, all of which are involved in making
proteins.

1.  **Messenger RNA (mRNA)** copies the genetic instructions from DNA in
    the nucleus, and carries the instructions to the cytoplasm.
2.  **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** helps form ribosomes, the organelle where
    proteins are assembled.
3.  **Transfer RNA (tRNA)** brings amino acids to ribosomes, where they
    are joined together to form proteins.

**How does a cell use the information in its DNA?**

To transcribe means ‘‘to paraphrase or summarize in writing’’. The
information in DNA is transcribed - or summarized - into a smaller
version - RNA - that can be used by the cell. This process is called
transcription.

### Transcription {#5.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNjcmlwdGlvbg.._4-4fx}

The process in which cells make proteins is called **protein synthesis**
. It actually consists of two processes: **transcription** and
**translation** . Transcription takes place in the nucleus. It uses DNA
as a template to make an RNA molecule. RNA then leaves the nucleus and
goes to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where translation occurs.
Translation reads the genetic code in mRNA and makes a protein.

Transcription is the first part of the central dogma of molecular
biology: *DNA → RNA* . It is the transfer of genetic instructions in DNA
to messenger RNA (mRNA). During transcription, a strand of mRNA is made
that is complementary to a strand of DNA. **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA1LU92ZXJ2aWV3LW9mLVRyYW5zY3JpcHRpb24.)
shows how this occurs. You can watch an animation of the process at this
link:

**Figure 5.6**

Overview of Transcription. Transcription uses the sequence of bases in a
strand of DNA to make a complementary strand of mRNA. Triplets are
groups of three successive nucleotide bases in DNA. Codons are
complementary groups of bases in mRNA.

</div>

#### Steps of Transcription {#5.html#x-ck12-U3RlcHMgb2YgVHJhbnNjcmlwdGlvbg.._4-o3b}

Transcription takes place in three steps: initiation, elongation, and
termination. The steps are illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA2LVRyYW5zY3JpcHRpb24.) .

1.  **Initiation** is the beginning of transcription. It occurs when the
    enzyme **RNA polymerase** binds to a region of a gene called the
    **promoter** . This signals the DNA to unwind so the enzyme can
    ‘‘read’’ the bases in one of the DNA strands. The enzyme is now
    ready to make a strand of mRNA with a complementary sequence
    of bases.
2.  **Elongation** is the addition of nucleotides to the mRNA strand.
    RNA polymerase reads the unwound DNA strand and builds the mRNA
    molecule, using complementary base pairs. There is a brief time
    during this process when the newly formed RNA is bound to the
    unwound DNA. During this process, an adenine (A) in the DNA binds to
    an uracil (U) in the RNA.
3.  **Termination** is the ending of transcription, and occurs when RNA
    polymerase crosses a stop (termination) sequence in the gene. The
    mRNA strand is complete, and it detaches from DNA.

In eukaryotes, the new mRNA is not yet ready for translation. It must go
through additional processing before it leaves the nucleus. This may
include splicing, editing, and polyadenylation. These processes modify
the mRNA in various ways. Such modifications allow a single gene to be
used to make more than one protein.

-   **Splicing** removes **introns** from mRNA (see **Figure**
    [below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA3LVNwbGljaW5n) ). Introns are
    regions that do not code for proteins. The remaining mRNA consists
    only of regions that do code for proteins, which are called
    **exons** . You can watch a video showing splicing in more detail at
    this link:
    [http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations/mrnasplicing/movie-flash.htm](movie-flash.htm) .
    Ribonucleoproteins are nucleoproteins that contains RNA. Small
    nuclear ribonuclearproteins are involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
-   **Editing** changes some of the nucleotides in mRNA. For example,
    the human protein called APOB, which helps transport lipids in the
    blood, has two different forms because of editing. One form is
    smaller than the other because editing adds a premature stop signal
    in the mRNA.
-   **Polyadenylation** adds a “tail” to the mRNA. The tail consists of
    a string of As (adenine bases). It signals the end of mRNA. It is
    also involved in exporting mRNA from the nucleus. In addition, the
    tail protects mRNA from enzymes that might break it down.

**How do you go from four letters to 20 amino acids?**

You need a code. And the code that changes the information embedded in
DNA and RNA into ordered amino acids and proteins is the genetic code.
And every living organism uses the same genetic code.

### The Genetic Code {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdlbmV0aWMgQ29kZQ.._5-m86}

How is the information in a gene encoded? The answer is the genetic
code. The **genetic code** consists of the sequence of nitrogen bases—A,
C, G, U—in an mRNA chain. The four bases make up the “letters” of the
genetic code. The letters are combined in groups of three to form code
“words,” called **codons** . Each codon stands for (encodes) one amino
acid, unless it codes for a start or stop signal.

There are 20 common amino acids in proteins. There are 64 possible
codons, more than enough to code for the 20 amino acids. The genetic
code is shown in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA4LUdlbmV0aWMtY29kZQ..) . To see how
scientists cracked the genetic code, go to this link:

**Figure 5.9**

The Genetic Code. To find the amino acid for a particular codon, find
the cell in the table for the first and second bases of the codon. Then,
within that cell, find the codon with the correct third base. For
example CUG codes for leucine, AAG codes for lysine, and GGG codes for
glycine.

</div>

#### Reading the Genetic Code {#5.html#x-ck12-UmVhZGluZyB0aGUgR2VuZXRpYyBDb2Rl_5-cpp}

As shown in **Figure**
[above](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA4LUdlbmV0aWMtY29kZQ..) , the codon AUG
codes for the amino acid methionine. This codon is also the **start
codon** that begins translation. The start codon establishes the reading
frame of mRNA. The **reading frame** is the way the letters are divided
into codons. After the AUG start codon, the next three letters are read
as the second codon. The next three letters after that are read as the
third codon, and so on. This is illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA5LXJlYWRpbmctZ2VuZXRpYy1jb2Rl) . The
mRNA molecule is read, codon by codon, until a **stop codon** is
reached. UAG, UGA, and UAA are all stop codons. They do not code for any
amino acids. Stop codons are also known as termination codons.

#### Characteristics of the Genetic Code {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIHRoZSBHZW5ldGljIENvZGU._5-7ys}

The genetic code has a number of important characteristics.

-   The genetic code is universal. All known living organisms use the
    same genetic code. This shows that all organisms share a common
    evolutionary history.
-   The genetic code is unambiguous. Each codon codes for just one amino
    acid (or start or stop). What might happen if codons encoded more
    than one amino acid?
-   The genetic code is redundant. Most amino acids are encoded by more
    than one codon. In **Figure**
    [above](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTA4LUdlbmV0aWMtY29kZQ..) , how many
    codons code for the amino acid threonine? What might be an advantage
    of having more than one codon for the same amino acid?

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-ezw}

-   The genetic code consists of the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA.
-   Groups of three bases form codons, and each codon stands for one
    amino acid (or start or stop).
-   The codons are read in sequence following the start codon until a
    stop codon is reached.
-   The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.

**RNA to proteins. How?**

You must translate. To go from one language to another. Spanish to
English, French to German, or nucleotides to amino acids. Which type is
the translation of molecular biology? Obviously, the type of translating
discussed here translates from the language of nucleotides to the
language of amino acids.

### Translation {#5.html#x-ck12-VHJhbnNsYXRpb24._6-mhs}

**Translation** is the second part of the central dogma of molecular
biology: *RNA → Protein* . It is the process in which the genetic code
in **mRNA** is read, one **codon** at a time, to make a protein.
**Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTEwLU1vZGlmaWVkLXRyYW5zbGF0aW9u) shows
how this happens. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it moves to a
**ribosome** , which consists of **rRNA** and proteins. The ribosome
reads the sequence of codons in mRNA. Molecules of **tRNA** bring amino
acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence.

at a
ribosome](ck12_5_files/20150914104352982823.png "DNA transcription to mRNA, which translates to a chain of amino acids at a ribosome")

**Figure 5.11**

Translation of the codons in mRNA to a chain of amino acids occurs at a
ribosome. Notice the growing amino acid chain attached to the tRNAs and
ribosome. Find the different types of RNA in the diagram. What are their
roles in translation?

</div>

To understand the role of tRNA, you need to know more about its
structure. Each tRNA molecule has an **anticodon** for the amino acid it
carries. An anticodon is a sequence of 3 bases, and is complementary to
the codon for an amino acid. For example, the amino acid lysine has the
codon AAG, so the anticodon is UUC. Therefore, lysine would be carried
by a tRNA molecule with the anticodon UUC. Wherever the codon AAG
appears in mRNA, a UUC anticodon on a tRNA temporarily binds to the
codon. While bound to the mRNA, the tRNA gives up its amino acid. Bonds
form between adjacent amino acids as they are brought one by one to the
ribosome, forming a **polypeptide** chain. The chain of amino acids
keeps growing until a stop codon is reached. To see how this happens, go
the link below.

![Structure of
tRNA](ck12_5_files/20150914104353294404.png "Structure of tRNA")

**Figure 5.12**

The tRNA structure is a very important aspect in its role. Though the
molecule folds into a *3-leaf clover* structure, notice the anticodon
arm in the lower segment of the molecule, with the amino acid attached
at the opposite end of the molecule (acceptor stem). It is the anticodon
that determines which codon in the mRNA the tRNA will bind to.

</div>

After a polypeptide chain is synthesized, it may undergo additional
processes. For example, it may assume a folded shape due to interactions
among its amino acids. It may also bind with other polypeptides or with
different types of molecules, such as lipids or carbohydrates. Many
proteins travel to the Golgi apparatus to be modified for the specific
job they will do. You can see how this occurs by watching the animation
at this link:

**What causes albinism?**

This rare albino alligator must have the specific "instructions," or
DNA, to have this quality. The cause of albinism is a mutation in a gene
for melanin, a protein found in skin and eyes. Such a mutation may
result in no melanin production at all or a significant decline in the
amount of melanin.

### Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-TXV0YXRpb25z_7-fak}

A change in the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA is called a **mutation**
. Does the word mutation make you think of science fiction and bug-eyed
monsters? Think again. Everyone has mutations. In fact, most people have
dozens or even hundreds of mutations in their DNA. Mutations are
essential for evolution to occur. They are the ultimate source of all
new genetic material - new **alleles** - in a species. Although most
mutations have no effect on the organisms in which they occur, some
mutations are beneficial. Even harmful mutations rarely cause drastic
changes in organisms.

#### Types of Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTXV0YXRpb25z_7-a9v}

There are a variety of types of mutations. Two major categories of
mutations are germline mutations and somatic mutations.

-   **Germline mutations** occur in gametes. These mutations are
    especially significant because they can be transmitted to offspring
    and every cell in the offspring will have the mutation.
-   **Somatic mutations** occur in other cells of the body. These
    mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are
    confined to just one cell and its daughter cells. Somatic mutations
    cannot be passed on to offspring.

Mutations also differ in the way that the genetic material is changed.
Mutations may change the structure of a chromosome or just change a
single nucleotide.

#### Chromosomal Alterations {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2hyb21vc29tYWwgQWx0ZXJhdGlvbnM._7-sgp}

**Chromosomal alterations** are mutations that change chromosome
structure. They occur when a section of a chromosome breaks off and
rejoins incorrectly or does not rejoin at all. Possible ways these
mutations can occur are illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTEyLUNocm9tb3NvbWUtYWx0ZXJhdGlvbnM.) .

**Figure 5.13**

Chromosomal Alterations. Chromosomal alterations are major changes in
the genetic material.

</div>

Chromosomal alterations are very serious. They often result in the death
of the organism in which they occur. If the organism survives, it may be
affected in multiple ways. An example of a human chromosomal alteration
is the mutation that causes Down Syndrome. It is a duplication mutation
that leads to developmental delays and other abnormalities.

#### Point Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-UG9pbnQgTXV0YXRpb25z_7-vmk}

A **point mutation** is a change in a single nucleotide in DNA. This
type of mutation is usually less serious than a chromosomal alteration.
An example of a point mutation is a mutation that changes the codon UUU
to the codon UCU. Point mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense
mutations, as shown in **Table**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cG9pbnQtbXV0YXRpb25z) . The effects of
point mutations depend on how they change the genetic code. You can
watch an animation about nonsense mutations at this link:
[http://www.biostudio.com/d\_%20Nonsense%20Suppression%20I%20Nonsense%20Mutation.htm](d_%20Nonsense%20Suppression%20I%20Nonsense%20Mutation.htm)
.

  **Type**   **Description**                                  **Example**                         **Effect**
  ---------- ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- -----------------
  Silent     mutated codon codes for the same amino acid      CAA (glutamine) → CAG (glutamine)   none
  Missense   mutated codon codes for a different amino acid   CAA (glutamine) → CCA (proline)     variable
  Nonsense   mutated codon is a premature stop codon          CAA (glutamine) → UAA (stop)        usually serious

#### Frameshift Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-RnJhbWVzaGlmdCBNdXRhdGlvbnM._7-niw}

A **frameshift mutation** is a deletion or insertion of one or more
nucleotides that changes the **reading frame** of the base sequence.
Deletions remove nucleotides, and insertions add nucleotides. Consider
the following sequence of bases in RNA:

AUG-AAU-ACG-GCU = start-asparagine-threonine-alanine

Now, assume an insertion occurs in this sequence. Let’s say an **A**
nucleotide is inserted after the start codon **AUG** :

AUG-AAA-UAC-GGC-U = start-lysine-tyrosine-glycine

Even though the rest of the sequence is unchanged, this insertion
changes the reading frame and thus all of the codons that follow it. As
this example shows, a frameshift mutation can dramatically change how
the codons in mRNA are read. This can have a drastic effect on the
protein product.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-5ny}

-   Germline mutations occur in gametes. Somatic mutations occur in
    other body cells.
-   Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change
    chromosome structure.

**What does radiation contamination do?**

It mutates DNA. The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that
occurred on April 26, 1986. It is considered the worst nuclear power
plant accident in history. A Russian publication concludes that 985,000
excess cancers occurred between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive
contamination. The 2011 report of the European Committee on Radiation
Risk calculates a total of 1.4 million excess cancers occurred as a
result of this contamination.

### Causes of Mutation {#5.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIE11dGF0aW9u_8-89f}

**Mutations** have many possible causes. Some mutations seem to happen
spontaneously without any outside influence. They can occur when
mistakes are made during DNA replication or transcription. Other
mutations are caused by environmental factors. Anything in the
environment that can cause a mutation is known as a **mutagen** .
Examples of mutagens are pictured in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTExLU11dGFnZW5z) . For a video about
mutagens, go the link below.

#### Spontaneous Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-U3BvbnRhbmVvdXMgTXV0YXRpb25z_8-u9r}

There are five common types of spontaneous mutations. These are
described in the **Table**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q29tbW9uX1Nwb250YW5lb3VzX011dGF0aW9ucw..)
.

  Mutation       Description
  -------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tautomerism    a base is changed by the repositioning of a hydrogen atom
  Depurination   loss of a purine base (A or G)
  Deamination    spontaneous deamination of 5-methycytosine
  Transition     a purine to purine (A to G, G to A), or a pyrimidine to pyrimidine (C to T, T to C) change
  Transversion   a purine becomes a pyrimidine, or vice versa

### The Chernobyl Disaster: Follow-up {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENoZXJub2J5bCBEaXNhc3RlcjogRm9sbG93LXVw_8-xi1}

Though the area immediately around the Chernobyl disaster may not be
safe for human life for thousands of years, the *Exclusion Zone* around
the Chernobyl nuclear power station has become a haven for wildlife. As
humans were evacuated from the area 25 years ago, existing animal
populations multiplied and rare species not seen for centuries have
returned or have been reintroduced, for example lynx, wild boar, wolf,
Eurasian brown bear, European bison, Przewalski's horse, and eagle owl.
Birds nest inside the cracked concrete *sarcophagus* shielding in the
shattered remains of the nuclear reactor. The Exclusion Zone is so lush
with wildlife and greenery that in 2007 the Ukrainian government
designated it a wildlife sanctuary. It is now one of the largest
wildlife sanctuaries in Europe.

**Is this rat hairless?**

Yes. Why? The result of a mutation, a change in the DNA sequence. The
effects of mutations can vary widely, from being beneficial, to having
no effect, to having lethal consequences, and every possibility in
between.

### Effects of Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBNdXRhdGlvbnM._9-o2n}

The majority of mutations have neither negative nor positive effects on
the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called **neutral
mutations** . Examples include silent point mutations. They are neutral
because they do not change the amino acids in the proteins they encode.

Many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are
repaired before protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple repair
mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA. One way DNA can be repaired is
illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTEzLUROQS1yZXBhaXItcGF0aHdheQ..) . If a
cell’s DNA is permanently damaged and cannot be repaired, the cell is
likely to be prevented from dividing.

#### Beneficial Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-QmVuZWZpY2lhbCBNdXRhdGlvbnM._9-hgw}

Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they
occur. They are called **beneficial mutations** . They lead to new
versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their
environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur.
They increase an organism’s changes of surviving or reproducing, so they
are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known
examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two:

1.  Mutations in many bacteria that allow them to survive in the
    presence of antibiotic drugs. The mutations lead to
    **antibiotic-resistant** strains of bacteria.
2.  A unique mutation is found in people in a small town in Italy. The
    mutation protects them from developing atherosclerosis, which is the
    dangerous buildup of fatty materials in blood vessels. The
    individual in which the mutation first appeared has even
    been identified.

#### Harmful Mutations {#5.html#x-ck12-SGFybWZ1bCBNdXRhdGlvbnM._9-1mw}

Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car
engine. The chance that the random change would improve the functioning
of the car is very small. The change is far more likely to result in a
car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. By the same
token, any random change in a gene's DNA is likely to result in a
protein that does not function normally or may not function at all. Such
mutations are likely to be harmful. Harmful mutations may cause genetic
disorders or cancer.

-   A **genetic disorder** is a disease caused by a mutation in one or a
    few genes. A human example is cystic fibrosis. A mutation in a
    single gene causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that
    clogs the lungs and blocks ducts in digestive organs. You can watch
    a video about cystic fibrosis and other genetic disorders at this
    link:
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s4he3wLgkM](watch?v=8s4he3wLgkM) (9:31).
-   **Cancer** is a disease in which cells grow out of control and form
    abnormal masses of cells. It is generally caused by mutations in
    genes that regulate the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, cells
    with damaged DNA are allowed to divide without limits. Cancer genes
    can be inherited. You can learn more about hereditary cancer by
    watching the video at the following link:

#### Albino Redwoods, Ghosts of the Forest {#5.html#x-ck12-QWxiaW5vIFJlZHdvb2RzLCBHaG9zdHMgb2YgdGhlIEZvcmVzdA.._9-9ah}

What happens if a plant does not have chlorophyll? They would lack the
part of the leaf that makes them green. So these plants could be
referred to as albino. This would have to result from a genetic
mutation. Do these plants die because they cannot photosynthesize? Not
necessarily. What can these plants tell us about the biochemistry,
genetics and physiology of plants?

**Can your expression change at any moment?**

As you know, a person's expression can change moment by moment. The
expression that is demonstrated is usually appropriate for that moment's
feelings. Gene expression is the use of a gene whose product is
necessary for that moment. It may be a moment during development, it may
be a moment of increased anxiety, or it may be in response to an
environmental change. Whenever a particular protein is needed, gene
expression provides it.

### Gene Expression {#5.html#x-ck12-R2VuZSBFeHByZXNzaW9u_10-cq6}

Each of your cells has at least 20,000 genes. In fact, all of your cells
have the same genes. Do all of your cells make the same proteins?
Obviously not. If they did, then all your cells would be alike. Instead,
you have cells with different structures and functions. This is because
different cells make different proteins. They do this by using, or
expressing, different genes. Using a gene to make a protein is called
**gene expression** .

#### How Gene Expression is Regulated {#5.html#x-ck12-SG93IEdlbmUgRXhwcmVzc2lvbiBpcyBSZWd1bGF0ZWQ._10-wgp}

Gene expression is regulated to ensure that the correct proteins are
made when and where they are needed. Regulation may occur at any point
in the expression of a gene, from the start of transcription to the
processing of a protein after translation. Following is a list of stages
where gene expression is regulated:

-   Chemical and structural modification of DNA or chromatin
-   Transcription
-   Translation
-   Post-transcriptional modification
-   RNA transport
-   mRNA degradation
-   Post-translational modifications

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTE0LXJlZ3VsYXRpb24tb2YtVHJhbnNjcmlwdGlvbg..)
, transcription is controlled by **regulatory proteins** binding to the
DNA. Specifically, gene regulation at the level of transcription
controls when transcription occurs as well as how much RNA is created. A
regulatory protein, or a **transcription factor** , is a protein
involved in regulating gene expression. It is usually bound to a
**cis-regulatory element** , which is part of the DNA. Regulatory
proteins often must be bound to a cis-regulatory element to switch a
gene on ( **activator** ), or to turn a gene off ( **repressor** ).

Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by at least
five mechanisms:

-   Specificity factors (proteins) alter the specificity of RNA
    polymerase for a promoter or set of promoters, making it more or
    less likely to bind to the promoter and begin transcription.
-   Activator proteins enhance the interaction between RNA polymerase
    and a particular promoter.
-   Repressor proteins bind to non-coding sequences on the DNA that are
    close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's
    progress along the strand.
-   Basal factors are transcription factors that help position RNA
    polymerase at the start of a gene.
-   **Enhancers** are sites on the DNA strand that are bound by
    activators in order to loop the DNA, bringing a specific
    transcription factor to the initiation complex. An **initiation
    complex** is composed of RNA polymerase and transcription factors.

As the organism grows more sophisticated, gene regulation becomes more
complex, though prokaryotic organisms possess some highly regulated
systems. Some human genes are controlled by many activators and
repressors working together. Obviously, a mutation in a cis-regulatory
region, such as the promoter, can greatly affect the proper expression
of a gene. It may keep the gene permanently off, such that no protein
can be made, or it can keep the gene permanently on, such that the
corresponding protein is constantly made. Both of these can have
detremental effects on the cell.

**On or off?**

When it comes to genes, that is an important question. And if you're a
single-celled organism like a bacterium, conserving energy by not
producing unnecessary proteins is very important.

### Prokaryotic Gene Regulation {#5.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90aWMgR2VuZSBSZWd1bGF0aW9u_11-t3o}

Transcription is regulated differently in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In
general, prokaryotic regulation is simpler than eukaryotic regulation.

#### The Role of Operons {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFJvbGUgb2YgT3Blcm9ucw.._11-pgm}

Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves operons.
An **operon** is a region of DNA that consists of one or more genes that
encode the proteins needed for a specific function. The operon also
includes a promoter and an operator. The **operator** is a region of the
operon where regulatory proteins bind. It is located near the
**promoter** and helps regulate transcription of the operon genes.

#### The Lac Operon {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExhYyBPcGVyb24._11-dnx}

A well-known example of operon regulation involves the **lac operon** in
*E. coli* bacteria (see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTE1LUxhYy1vcGVyb24.) and the video at
the link below). The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and
three genes that encode the enzymes needed to digest lactose, the sugar
found in milk. The lac operon is regulated by lactose in the
environment. The *Lac Operon* video at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBwtxdI1zvk](watch?v=oBwtxdI1zvk)
explains the operon in further detail.

-   When lactose is absent, a **repressor** protein binds to
    the operator. The operator is located between the promoter and the
    three lac operon genes. The protein blocks the binding of RNA
    polymerase to the promoter. As a result, the lac genes are
    not expressed.
-   When lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to
    the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and
    begin transcription. As a result, the lac genes are expressed, and
    lactose is digested.

Why might it be beneficial to express genes only when they are needed?
(Hint: synthesizing proteins requires energy and materials.)

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._11-4b0}

-   Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves an
    operon, such as the lac operon in *E. coli* .
-   The lac operon is regulated by proteins that behave differently
    depending on whether lactose is present or absent.

**On or Off? On or Off? On or Off?**

That is the key question. Gene regulation in eukaryotes is a highly
regulated process usually involving many proteins, which either bind to
each other or bind to the DNA.

### Eukaryotic Gene Regulation {#5.html#x-ck12-RXVrYXJ5b3RpYyBHZW5lIFJlZ3VsYXRpb24._12-xlt}

In eukaryotic cells, the start of transcription is one of the most
complicated parts of gene regulation. There may be many regulatory
proteins and regulatory elements involved. Regulation may also involve
enhancers. **Enhancers** are distant regions of DNA that can loop back
to interact with a gene’s promoter.

#### The TATA Box {#5.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRBVEEgQm94_12-myu}

Different types of cells have unique patterns of regulatory elements
that result in only the necessary genes being transcribed. That’s why a
skin cell and nerve cell, for example, are so different from each other.
However, some patterns of regulatory elements are common to all genes,
regardless of the cells in which they occur. An example is the **TATA
box** , so named because it has a core sequence of *TATAAA* . This is a
regulatory element that is part of the promoter of most eukaryotic
genes. A number of regulatory proteins bind to the TATA box, forming a
multi-protein complex. It is only when all of the appropriate proteins
are bound to the TATA box that RNA polymerase recognizes the complex and
binds to the promoter. Once RNA polymerase binds, transcription begins.
To see a video showing the role of the TATA box in the initiation of
transcription, go to this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tqPsI-9aQA](watch?v=6tqPsI-9aQA) .

#### Regulation During Development {#5.html#x-ck12-UmVndWxhdGlvbiBEdXJpbmcgRGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ._12-dpw}

The regulation of gene expression is extremely important during the
development of an organism. Regulatory proteins must turn on certain
genes in particular cells at just the right time so the organism
develops normal organs and organ systems. **Homeobox genes** are an
example of genes that regulate development. They code for regulatory
proteins that switch on whole series of major developmental genes. In
insects, homeobox genes called **hox genes** ensure that body parts such
as limbs develop in the correct place. **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTE2LUhveG11dGF0aW9u) shows how a
mutation in a hox gene can affect an insect’s development. Other
organisms, including humans, also have how genes. You can learn more
about homeobox genes at this link:

#### Gene Expression and Cancer {#5.html#x-ck12-R2VuZSBFeHByZXNzaW9uIGFuZCBDYW5jZXI._12-ghj}

The mutations that cause cancer generally occur in two types of
regulatory genes: **tumor-suppressor genes** and **proto-oncogenes**
(see **Figure**
[below](#5.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA3LTE3LWNhbmNlci1tdXRhdGlvbnM.) ). These
genes produce regulatory proteins that control the cell cycle. When the
genes mutate, cells with mutations divide rapidly and without limits,
potentially resulting in a tumor and cancer.

### Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-taa}

-   Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is generally more complex
    than in prokaryotes. It involves unique regulatory elements in
    different cells as well as common regulatory elements such as the
    TATA box.
-   Regulation is especially important during development. It may
    involve regulatory genes such as homeobox genes that switch other
    regulatory genes on or off.
-   Mutations in regulatory genes that normally control the cell cycle
    cause cancer.

## Summary {#5.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-qm0}

Molecular Biology focuses on DNA and how proteins are made. DNA contains
the information used to make RNA. RNA leaves the nucleus and, together
with a ribosome, makes proteins. The genetic code is the universal code
that all life uses to turn the language of nucleotides into the language
of amino acids. Mistakes in the DNA or RNA sequence can have dangerous
consequences for the organism, though these same "mistakes" are the
driving force of evolution. Regulating the specific timing of genes is
an important process for cells in every organism to function properly.

**Do dinosaurs prove evolution?**

For millions of years dinosaurs roamed and dominated the planet. Then 65
million years ago, they went extinct. In fact, over 90% of species that
have lived are now extinct. The *change in species over time* is
evolution, the focus of the lessons in the *Evolution* chapter.

**How do we learn about the past?**

We study the remains of things that existed many years ago. The Ruins of
Pompeii have given archeologists, historians, and other scholars a
tremendous amount of information about life two thousand years ago. This
section discusses studying things that are many thousands of years older
than these remains.

### Earth in a Day {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFydGggaW4gYSBEYXk.-qoa}

It’s hard to grasp the vast amounts of time since Earth formed and life
first appeared on its surface. It may help to think of Earth’s history
as a 24-hour day, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTAxLUhpc3Rvcnktb2YtRWFydGg.) . Humans
would have appeared only during the last minute of that day. If we are
such newcomers on planet Earth, how do we know about the vast period of
time that went before us? How have we learned about the distant past?

### Learning About the Past {#6.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5pbmcgQWJvdXQgdGhlIFBhc3Q.-lzn}

Much of what we know about the history of life on Earth is based on the
fossil record. Detailed knowledge of modern organisms also helps us
understand how life evolved.

#### The Fossil Record {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZvc3NpbCBSZWNvcmQ.-h0w}

**Fossils** are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived
in the past. The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly
after death. On occasion, the hard parts—mainly bones, teeth, or
shells—remain long enough to mineralize and form fossils. An example of
a complete fossil skeleton is shown in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTAyLUV4dGluY3QtTGlvbi1Gb3NzaWw.) . The
**fossil record** is the record of life that unfolded over four billion
years and pieced back together through the analysis of fossils.

**Figure 6.2**

Extinct Lion Fossil. This fossilized skeleton represents an extinct lion
species. It is rare for fossils to be so complete and well preserved as
this one.

</div>

To be preserved as fossils, remains must be covered quickly by sediments
or preserved in some other way. For example, they may be frozen in
glaciers or trapped in tree resin, like the frog in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTAzLUZyb2ctYW1iZXItRm9vdHByaW50LWRpbm9zYXVyLWZvc3NpbA..)
. Sometimes traces of organisms—such as footprints or burrows—are
preserved (see the fossil footprints in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTAzLUZyb2ctYW1iZXItRm9vdHByaW50LWRpbm9zYXVyLWZvc3NpbA..)
). The conditions required for fossils to form rarely occur. Therefore,
the chance of an organism being preserved as a fossil is very low. You
can watch a video at the following link to see in more detail how
fossils form:

</div>

In order for fossils to “tell” us the story of life, they must be dated.
Then they can help scientists reconstruct how life changed over time.
Fossils can be dated in two different ways: relative dating and absolute
dating. Both are described below. You can also learn more about dating
methods in the video at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM7vZ-9bBc0](watch?v=jM7vZ-9bBc0) .

-   **Relative dating** determines which of two fossils is older or
    younger than the other, but not their age in years. Relative dating
    is based on the positions of fossils in rock layers. Lower layers
    were laid down earlier, so they are assumed to contain
    older fossils. This is illustrated in **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTA0LVJlbGF0aXZlLURhdGluZy1Sb2NrLUxheWVycw..) .
-   **Absolute dating** determines about how long ago a fossil
    organism lived. This gives the fossil an approximate age in years.
    Absolute dating is often based on the amount of carbon-14 or other
    radioactive element that remains in a fossil. You can learn more
    about carbon-14 dating by watching the animation at this link:

</div>

#### Molecular Clocks {#6.html#x-ck12-TW9sZWN1bGFyIENsb2Nrcw..-gxr}

Evidence from the fossil record can be combined with data from molecular
clocks. A **molecular clock** uses DNA sequences (or the proteins they
encode) to estimate relatedness among species. Molecular clocks estimate
the time in geologic history when related species diverged from a common
ancestor. Molecular clocks are based on the assumption that mutations
accumulate through time at a steady average rate for a given region of
DNA. Species that have accumulated greater differences in their DNA
sequences are assumed to have diverged from their common ancestor in the
more distant past. Molecular clocks based on different regions of DNA
may be used together for more accuracy.

Consider the example in **Table**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q29tcGFyaW5nLUROQQ..) . The table shows
how similar the DNA of several animal species is to human DNA. Based on
these data, which organism do you think shared the most recent common
ancestor with humans?

  **Organism**   **Similarity with Human DNA (percent)**
  -------------- -----------------------------------------
  Chimpanzee     98
  Mouse          85
  Chicken        60
  Fruit Fly      44

#### Geologic Time Scale {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VvbG9naWMgVGltZSBTY2FsZQ..-zxw}

Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the
**geologic time scale** , shown in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTA1LWdlb2xvZ2ljLXRpbWUtc2NhbGU.) . The
geologic time scale divides Earth’s history into divisions (such as
eons, eras, and periods) that are based on major changes in geology,
climate, and the evolution of life. It organizes Earth’s history and the
evolution of life on the basis of important events instead of time
alone. It also allows more focus to be placed on recent events, about
which we know the most.

**What alien planet is represented by this picture?**

Would it surprise you to learn that the picture represents Earth? After
Earth first formed about 4.6 billion years ago, it may well have looked
like this. Instead of rivers of water, rivers of molten rock flowed over
its surface. Life as we know it could not have survived in such a place.
How did this fiery hot planet become today’s Earth, covered with water
and teeming with life? The long and incredible story of Earth’s history
starts with this section.

### How Earth Formed: We Are Made of Stardust! {#6.html#x-ck12-SG93IEVhcnRoIEZvcm1lZDogV2UgQXJlIE1hZGUgb2YgU3RhcmR1c3Qh_1-bnw}

We’ll start the story of life at the very beginning, when Earth and the
rest of the solar system first formed. The solar system began as a
rotating cloud of stardust. “Dust, rocks, and gas” may not sound
inspiring, but this cloud contained the 92 **elements** which somehow
combine to form every corner – living and nonliving – of Earth. Then the
**Big Bang** (14 billion years ago) produced the atoms of hydrogen and
helium. Elements as heavy as lithium followed the Big Bang within
minutes. Stars such as red giants fused hydrogen and helium nuclei to
form elements from carbon (the foundation of life) to calcium (now our
bones and teeth). Supernova explosions formed and ejected heavier
elements such as iron (for red blood cells). We are not just “dust.” We
- and our world - are stardust!

How did this rotating cloud of stardust become our solar system? About
4.5 billion years ago, a nearby star exploded and sent a shock wave
through the dust cloud, increasing its rate of spin. As a result, most
of the mass became concentrated in the middle, forming the sun. Smaller
concentrations of mass rotating around the center formed the planets,
including Earth.

You can watch a video showing how Earth formed at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x8-KMR0nx8](watch?v=-x8-KMR0nx8) .

At first, Earth was molten and lacked an atmosphere and oceans.
Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. As the planet
continued to cool, volcanoes released gases, which eventually formed an
**atmosphere** . The early atmosphere contained ammonia, methane, water
vapor, and carbon dioxide but only a trace of oxygen. As the atmosphere
became denser, clouds formed and rain fell. Water from rain, and perhaps
from comets and asteroids that struck Earth as well, eventually formed
the oceans. The ancient atmosphere and oceans represented by the picture
in **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTA2LU9jZWFuLWZvcm1pbmc.)
would be toxic to today’s life, but they set the stage for life to
begin.

**How do you make large molecules?**

From smaller ones. The first organic molecules were probably very simple
carbon-based molecules made of few atoms. These molecules then combined
with other simple molecules to form more complex molecules. Over many
years and probably trillions and trillions of chemical reactions, more
complex molecules, and more stable molecules, formed.

### The First Organic Molecules {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZpcnN0IE9yZ2FuaWMgTW9sZWN1bGVz_2-cor}

All living things consist of **organic molecules** , centered around the
element carbon. Therefore, it is likely that organic molecules evolved
before cells, perhaps as long as 4 billion years ago. How did these
building blocks of life first form?

Scientists think that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earth’s
early atmosphere. The early atmosphere contained gases such as ammonia,
methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Scientists hypothesize that
this created a “soup” of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. In
1953, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey used their imaginations
to test this hypothesis. They created a simulation experiment to see if
organic molecules could arise in this way (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTA3LU1pbGxlci1VcmV5) ). They used a
mixture of gases to represent Earth’s early atmosphere. Then, they
passed sparks through the gases to represent lightning. Within a week,
several simple organic molecules had formed. You can watch a
dramatization of Miller and Urey’s experiment at this link:

</div>

#### Which Organic Molecule Came First? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hpY2ggT3JnYW5pYyBNb2xlY3VsZSBDYW1lIEZpcnN0Pw.._2-jmy}

Living things need organic molecules to store genetic information and to
carry out the chemical work of cells. Modern organisms use DNA to store
genetic information and proteins to catalyze chemical reactions. So, did
DNA or proteins evolve first? This is like asking whether the chicken or
the egg came first. DNA encodes proteins and proteins are needed to make
DNA, so each type of organic molecule needs the other for its own
existence. How could either of these two molecules have evolved before
the other? Did some other organic molecule evolve first, instead of DNA
or proteins?

#### RNA World Hypothesis {#6.html#x-ck12-Uk5BIFdvcmxkIEh5cG90aGVzaXM._2-uxc}

Some scientists speculate that RNA may have been the first organic
molecule to evolve. In fact, they think that early life was based solely
on RNA and that DNA and proteins evolved later. This is called the **RNA
world hypothesis.** Why RNA? It can encode genetic instructions (like
DNA), and some RNAs can carry out chemical reactions (like proteins).
Therefore, it solves the chicken-and-egg problem of which of these two
molecules came first. Other evidence also suggests that RNA may be the
most ancient of the organic molecules. You can learn more about the RNA
world hypothesis and the evidence for it at this link:

**How do you make complex cells?**

You start with simple ones. The first cells were most likely primitive
prokaryotic-like cells, even more simplistic than these *E. coli*
bacteria. The first cells were probably no more than organic compounds,
such as a simplistic RNA, surrounded by a membrane. Was it a
phospholipid bilayer membrane? Probably not — it was likely a simplistic
membrane able to separate the inside from the outside. Over time, as
other organic compounds such as DNA and proteins developed, cells also
evolved into more complex structures. Once a cell was able to be stable,
reproduce itself, and pass its genetic information to the next
generation, then there was life.

### The First Cells {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZpcnN0IENlbGxz_3-w2j}

What was needed for the first cell? Some sort of membrane surrounding
organic molecules? Probably.

How organic molecules such as RNA developed into cells is not known for
certain. Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around the
organic molecules. The membranes prevented the molecules from reacting
with other molecules, so they did not form new compounds. In this way,
the organic molecules persisted, and the first cells may have formed.
**Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTA4LWh5cG90aGV0aWNhbC1maXJzdC1jZWxs)
shows a model of the hypothetical first cell. Were these first cells the
first living organisms? Were they able to live and reproduce while
passing their genetic information to the next generation? If so, then
yes, these first cells could be considered the first living organisms.

#### LUCA {#6.html#x-ck12-TFVDQQ.._3-5th}

No doubt there were many early cells of this type. However, scientists
think that only one early cell (or group of cells) eventually gave rise
to all subsequent life on Earth. That one cell is called the **Last
Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA).** It probably existed around 3.5
billion years ago. LUCA was one of the earliest **prokaryotic cells** .
It would have lacked a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. To
learn more about LUCA and universal common descent, you can watch the
video at the following link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0UGpcea8Zg](watch?v=G0UGpcea8Zg) .

#### Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration {#6.html#x-ck12-UGhvdG9zeW50aGVzaXMgYW5kIENlbGx1bGFyIFJlc3BpcmF0aW9u_3-xrc}

The earliest cells were probably **heterotrophs** . Most likely they got
their energy from other molecules in the organic “soup.” However, by
about 3 billion years ago, a new way of obtaining energy evolved. This
new way was **photosynthesis** . Through photosynthesis, organisms could
use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water. These organisms
were the first **autotrophs** . They provided food for themselves and
for other organisms that began to consume them.

After photosynthesis evolved, oxygen started to accumulate in the
atmosphere. This has been dubbed the “oxygen catastrophe.” Why? Oxygen
was toxic to most early cells because they had evolved in its absence.
As a result, many of them died out. The few that survived evolved a new
way to take advantage of the oxygen. This second major innovation was
**cellular respiration** . It allowed cells to use oxygen to obtain more
energy from organic molecules.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-kun}

-   The first cells consisted of little more than an organic molecule
    such as RNA inside a lipid membrane.
-   One cell (or group of cells), called the last universal common
    ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all subsequent life on Earth.
-   Photosynthesis evolved by 3 billion years ago and released oxygen
    into the atmosphere.
-   Cellular respiration evolved after that to make use of the oxygen.

**Why can this fish live in these tentacles, but other fish cannot?**

Anemones and Clown Fish have a well-known symbiotic relationship. In the
ocean, the Clown Fish are protected from predator fish by the stinging
tentacles of the anemone, and the anemone receives protection from
polyp-eating fish, which the Clown Fish chases away. But what about
symbiotic relationships at a much smaller scale? Is it possible for two
single-celled organisms to have a symbiotic relationship? As you will
find out, yes it is!

### Evolution of Eukaryotes {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEV1a2FyeW90ZXM._4-nyj}

Our own eukaryotic cells protect DNA in chromosomes with a nuclear
membrane, make ATP with mitochondria, move with flagella (in the case of
sperm cells), and feed on cells which make our food with chloroplasts.
All multicellular organisms and the unicellular Protists share this
cellular intricacy. Bacterial (prokaryotic) cells are orders of
magnitude smaller and have none of this complexity. What quantum leap in
evolution created this vast chasm of difference?

The first **eukaryotic cells** - cells with a **nucleus** an internal
membrane-bound **organelles** - probably evolved about 2 billion years
ago. This is explained by the **endosymbiotic theory** . As shown in the
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTA5LUNlbGwtdG8tT3JnYW5lbGxl)
, **endosymbiosis** came about when large cells engulfed small cells.
The small cells were not digested by the large cells. Instead, they
lived within the large cells and evolved into organelles.

**Figure 6.9**

From Independent Cell to Organelle. The endosymbiotic theory explains
how eukaryotic cells evolved.

</div>

The large and small cells formed a **symbiotic relationship** in which
both cells benefited. Some of the small cells were able to break down
the large cell’s wastes for energy. They supplied energy not only to
themselves but also to the large cell. They became the mitochondria of
eukaryotic cells. Other small cells were able to use sunlight to make
food. They shared the food with the large cell. They became the
chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells.

#### Mitochondria and Chloroplasts {#6.html#x-ck12-TWl0b2Nob25kcmlhIGFuZCBDaGxvcm9wbGFzdHM._4-xoa}

What is the evidence for this evolutionary pathway? Biochemistry and
electron microscopy provide convincing support. The mitochondria and
chloroplasts within our eukaryotic cells share the following features
with prokaryotic cells:

-   Their organelle DNA is short and circular, and the DNA sequences do
    not match DNA sequences found in the nucleus.
-   Molecules that make up organelle membranes resemble those in
    prokaryotic membranes – and differ from those in
    eukaryotic membranes.
-   Ribosomes in these organelles are similar to those of bacterial
    ribosomes, and different from eukaryotic ribosomes.
-   Reproduction is by binary fission, not by mitosis.
-   Biochemical pathways and structures show closer relationships
    to prokaryotes.
-   Two or more membranes surround these organelles.

The "host" cell membrane and biochemistry are more similar to those of
Archaebacteria, so scientists believe eukaryotes descended more directly
from that major group ( **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvMTEtMS0y)
). The timing of this dramatic evolutionary event (more likely a series
of events) is not clear. The oldest fossil clearly related to modern
eukaryotes is a red alga dating back to 1.2 billion years ago. However,
many scientists place the appearance of eukaryotic cells at about 2
billion years. Some time within Proterozoic Eon, then, all three major
groups of life – Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes – became well
established.

#### What Does it all Mean? {#6.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBEb2VzIGl0IGFsbCBNZWFuPw.._4-ob8}

Eukaryotic cells, made possible by endosymbiosis, were powerful and
efficient. That power and efficiency gave them the potential to evolve
new characteristics: multicellularity, cell specialization, and large
size. They were the key to the spectacular diversity of animals, plants,
and fungi that populate our world today. Nevertheless, as we close the
history of early life, reflect once more on the remarkable but often
unsung patterns and processes of early evolution. Often, as humans, we
focus our attention on plants and animals, and ignore bacteria. Our
human senses cannot directly perceive the unimaginable variety of single
cells, the architecture of organic molecules, or the intricacy of
biochemical pathways. Let your study of early evolution give you a new
perspective – a window into the beauty and diversity of unseen worlds,
now and throughout Earth’s history. In addition to the mitochondria that
call your 100 trillion cells home, your body contains more bacterial
cells than human cells. You, mitochondria, and your resident bacteria
share common ancestry – a continuous history of the gift of life.

### Multicellular Life: Setting the Stage {#6.html#x-ck12-TXVsdGljZWxsdWxhciBMaWZlOiBTZXR0aW5nIHRoZSBTdGFnZQ.._5-goe}

Nearly 80% of Earth’s history passed before multicellular life evolved.
Up until then, all organisms existed as single cells. Why did
multicellular organisms evolve? What led up to this major step in the
evolution of life? To put the evolution of multicellularity in context,
let’s return to what was happening on planet Earth during this part of
its history.

#### The Late Precambrian {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExhdGUgUHJlY2FtYnJpYW4._5-t0s}

The **late Precambrian** is the time from about 2 billion to half a
billion years ago. During this long span of time, Earth experienced many
dramatic geologic and climatic changes.

-   Continents drifted. They collided to form a gigantic supercontinent
    and then broke up again and moved apart. Continental drift changed
    climates worldwide and caused intense volcanic activity. To see an
    animation of continental drift, go to this link:
    [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/anim1.html](anim1.html) .
-   Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rose and fell. This was due
    to volcanic activity and other factors. When the levels were high,
    they created a **greenhouse effect** . More heat was trapped on
    Earth’s surface, and the climate became warmer. When the levels were
    low, less heat was trapped and the planet cooled. Several times,
    cooling was severe enough to plunge Earth into an ice age. One ice
    age was so cold that snow and ice completely covered the planet.
    Earth during this ice age has been called **snowball Earth** (see
    **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTEwLVNub3diYWxsLUVhcnRoLTI.) ).

Snowball Earth. During the late Precambrian, Earth grew so cold that it
was covered with snow and ice. Earth during this ice age has been called
snowball Earth.

#### Life During the Late Precambrian {#6.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBEdXJpbmcgdGhlIExhdGUgUHJlY2FtYnJpYW4._5-kxl}

The dramatic changes of the late Precambrian had a major impact on
Earth’s life forms. Living things that could not adapt died out. They
were replaced by organisms that evolved new adaptations. These
adaptations included **sexual reproduction** , specialization of cells,
and **multicellularity** .

-   Sexual reproduction created much more variety among offspring. This
    increased the chances that at least some of them would survive when
    the environment changed. It also increased the speed at which
    evolution could occur.
-   Some cells started to live together in colonies. In some colonies,
    cells started to specialize in doing different jobs. This made the
    cells more efficient as a colony than as individual cells.
-   By 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular organisms
    had evolved. They may have developed from colonies of
    specialized cells. Their cells were so specialized they could no
    longer survive independently. However, together they were mighty.
    They formed an organism that was bigger, more efficient, and able to
    do much more than any single-celled organism ever could.

#### The Precambrian Extinction {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByZWNhbWJyaWFuIEV4dGluY3Rpb24._5-zt4}

At the close of the Precambrian 544 million years ago, a mass extinction
occurred. In a **mass extinction** , many or even most species abruptly
disappear from Earth. There have been five mass extinctions in Earth’s
history. Many scientists think we are currently going through a sixth
mass extinction. What caused the Precambrian mass extinction? A
combination of climatic and geologic events was probably responsible. No
matter what the cause, the extinction paved the way for a burst of new
life, called the Cambrian explosion, during the following Paleozoic Era.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-yus}

-   During the late Precambrian, continents drifted, carbon dioxide
    levels fluctuated, and climates changed. Many organisms could not
    survive the changes and died out.
-   Other organisms evolved important new adaptations. These include
    sexual reproduction, cell specialization, and multicellularity.
-   The Precambrian ended with a mass extinction, which paved the way
    for the Cambrian explosion.

**What was early life like?**

Prehistoric underwater life exploded with amazing new creatures during
the Paleozoic Era. Evolution allowed life to take many diverse forms,
eventually developing the necessary adaptations to move from the ocean
onto land.

### Life During the Paleozoic {#6.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBEdXJpbmcgdGhlIFBhbGVvem9pYw.._6-ori}

The **Paleozoic Era** is literally the era of “old life.” It lasted from
544 to 245 million years ago and is divided into six periods. Major
events in each period of the Paleozoic Era are described in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTExLVBhbGVvem9pYy1FcmE.) . The era began
with a spectacular burst of new life. This is called the **Cambrian
explosion.** The era ended with the biggest mass extinction the world
had ever seen. This is known as the **Permian extinction.** At the
following link, you can watch a video about these and other events of
the Paleozoic Era:

The Paleozoic Era includes the six periods described here.

</div>

#### The Paleozoic Era {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBhbGVvem9pYyBFcmE._6-rp8}

**The Cambrian Period** : Following the Precambrian mass extinction,
there was an explosion of new kinds of organisms in the Cambrian Period
(544–505 million years ago). Many types of primitive animals called
sponges evolved. Small ocean invertebrates called **trilobites** became
abundant.

Cambrian explosion are reef-building sponges (left) and early arthropods
known as trilobites (right). Both were abundant during the Cambrian and
later became extinct; however, the phyla they represent persist to this
day.

</div>

**The Ordovician Period** : During the next period, the Ordovician
Period (505–440 million years ago), the oceans became filled with
invertebrates of many types. Also during this period, the first fish
evolved and plants colonized the land for the first time. But animals
still remained in the water.

**The Silurian Period** : During the Silurian Period (440–410 million
years ago), corals appeared in the oceans, and fish continued to evolve.
On land, vascular plants appeared. With special tissues to circulate
water and other materials, these plants could grow larger than the
earlier nonvascular plants.

</div>

**The Devonian Period** : During the Devonian Period (410–360 million
years ago), the first seed plants evolved. Seeds have a protective coat
and stored food to help these plants survive. Seed plants eventually
became the most common type of land plants. In the oceans, fish with
lobe fins evolved. They could breathe air when they raised their heads
above water. Breathing would be necessary for animals to eventually
colonize the land.

**Figure 6.15**

On land, club mosses, horsetails, and ferns joined primitive seed plants
and early trees to form the first forests.

</div>

**The Carboniferous Period** : Next, during the Carboniferous Period
(360–290 million years ago), widespread forests of huge plants left
massive deposits of carbon that eventually turned to coal. The first
amphibians evolved to move out of the water and colonize land, but they
had to return to the water to reproduce. Soon after amphibians arose,
the first reptiles evolved. They were the first animals that could
reproduce on dry land.

**The Permian Period** : During the Permian Period (290–245 million
years ago), all the major land masses collided to form a supercontinent
called **Pangaea** . Temperatures were extreme, and the climate was dry.
Plants and animals evolved adaptations to dryness, such as waxy leaves
or leathery skin to prevent water loss. The Permian Period ended with a
mass extinction.

**Figure 6.16**

The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a
single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which
harbor marine species, and may have contributed to the dramatic event
which ended the Permian - the most massive extinction ever recorded.

</div>

In the mass extinction that ended the Permian, the majority of species
went extinct. Many hypotheses have been offered to explain why this mass
extinction occurred. These include huge meteorites striking Earth and
enormous volcanoes spewing ashes and gases into the atmosphere. Both
could have darkened the skies with dust for many months. This, in turn,
would have shut down photosynthesis and cooled the planet.

Despite the great loss of life, there was light at the end of the
tunnel. The Permian extinction paved the way for another burst of new
life at the start of the following Mesozoic Era. This included the
evolution of the dinosaurs.

**What exactly is a dinosaur?**

Two dinosaurs wade through shallow waters to get to the vegetation on
this island. The Mesozoic Era is the age of dinosaurs. These animals
grew so large they dominated the planet. Dinosaurs were so dominant that
it took a catastrophic, environment-changing event for mammals to be
able to take over.

### Mesozoic Era: The Age of Dinosaurs {#6.html#x-ck12-TWVzb3pvaWMgRXJhOiBUaGUgQWdlIG9mIERpbm9zYXVycw.._7-sbv}

The **Mesozoic Era** is literally the era of “middle life.” It is also
known as the age of **dinosaurs** . It lasted from 245 to 65 million
years ago and is divided into the three periods described in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTEyLU1lc296b2ljLUVyYQ..) . The Mesozoic
began with the supercontinent **Pangaea** . Then, during the era,
Pangaea broke up and the continents drifted apart. The movement of
continents changed climates. It also caused tremendous volcanic
activity.

**Mass extinctions** occurred at the end of the Triassic and Cretaceous
Periods. The first extinction paved the way for a dinosaur takeover. In
the second extinction, the dinosaurs finally disappeared. At the link
below, you can watch a video about these and other exciting events
during the age of dinosaurs.

![The Mesozoic Era consists of the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous
periods](ck12_6_files/20150914104450086326.png "The Mesozoic Era consists of the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods")

**Figure 6.17**

The Mesozoic Era consists of the three periods described here.

</div>

**The Triassic Period** : During the Triassic Period (245–200 million
years ago), the first dinosaurs branched off from the reptiles and
colonized the land, air, and water. Huge seed ferns and conifers
dominated the forests, and modern corals, fish, and insects evolved. The
supercontinent Pangaea started to separate into **Laurasia** (today’s
Northern Hemisphere continents) and **Gondwanaland** (today’s Southern
Hemisphere continents). The Triassic Period ended with a mass
extinction.

**The Jurassic Period** : The next period, the Jurassic Period (200–145
million years ago), began after the mass extinction that ended the
Triassic Period. This mass extinction allowed dinosaurs to flourish in
the Jurassic Period. This was the golden age of dinosaurs. Also during
the Jurassic, the earliest birds evolved from reptile ancestors, and all
the major groups of mammals evolved, though individual mammals were
still small in size. Flowering plants appeared for the first time, and
new insects also evolved to pollinate the flowers. The continents
continued to move apart, and volcanic activity was especially intense.
The classic Steven Spielberg movie *Jurassic Park* realistically depicts
some of the dinosaurs present during this period:

**The Cretaceous Period** : During the Cretaceous Period (145–65 million
years ago), dinosaurs reached their peak in size and distribution.
*Tyrannosaurus Rex* , weighed at least 7 tons. By the end of the
Cretaceous, the continents were close to their present locations.
Earth’s overall climate was warm; even the poles lacked ice. The period
ended with the dramatic extinction of the dinosaurs.

What happened to the dinosaurs? Why did they go extinct at the end of
the Cretaceous Period? Some scientists think a comet or asteroid may
have collided with Earth, causing skies to darken, photosynthesis to
shut down, and climates to change. A collision was probably at least a
contributing factor. Without the dinosaurs, there were many
opportunities for new organisms to exploit in the next era, the
Cenozoic. Which living things do you think took over where the dinosaurs
left off?

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-u0w}

-   The Mesozoic Era is the age of dinosaurs. They evolved from earlier
    reptiles to fill niches on land, in the water, and in the air.
-   Mammals also evolved but were small in size.
-   Flowering plants appeared for the first time.

**What allowed mammals to outlast the dinosaurs?**

With dinosaurs around, mammals could not thrive. It took a catastrophic
event to rid the planet of dinosaurs. Luckily for mammals, the
extinction of the dinosaurs left many opportunities for mammals to take
over and flourish.

### The Cenozoic Era: Age of Mammals {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENlbm96b2ljIEVyYTogQWdlIG9mIE1hbW1hbHM._8-9dq}

The **Cenozoic Era** literally means the era of “modern life.” It is
also called the age of mammals. Mammals took advantage of the extinction
of the dinosaurs. They flourished and soon became the dominant animals
on Earth. You can learn more about the evolution of mammals during the
Cenozoic at the link below. The Cenozoic began 65 million years ago and
continues to the present. It may be divided into the two periods
described in **Figure**

periods](ck12_6_files/20150914104450598654.png "The Cenozoic Era consists of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods")

**Figure 6.18**

One way of dividing the Cenozoic Era is into the two periods described
here.

</div>

**The Tertiary Period** : During the Tertiary Period (65–1.8 million
years ago), Earth’s climate was generally warm and humid. This allowed
mammals to evolve further and fill virtually all niches vacated by the
dinosaurs. Many mammals increased in size. Mammals called **primates**
evolved, including human ancestors. Modern rain forests and grasslands
appeared, and flowering plants and insects were numerous and widespread.

**The Quaternary Period** : During the Quaternary Period (1.8 million
years ago–present), Earth’s climate cooled, leading to a series of ice
ages. Sea levels fell because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This
created land bridges between continents, allowing land animals to move
to new areas. Some mammals, like the woolly mammoths adapted to the cold
by evolving very large size and thick fur. Other animals moved closer to
the equator or went extinct, along with many plants.

The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. By that time, our own
species, ***Homo sapiens*** , had evolved. After that, we were witnesses
to the unfolding of life’s story. Although we don’t know all the details
of the recent past, it is far less of a mystery than the billions of
years that preceded it.

‘‘Walking With Cavemen’’ is an excellent depiction of the evolution of
our species, from Lucy, the first upright ape, to her ancestors millions
of years later. See
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric\_life/tv\_radio/wwcavemen/]() for
additional information.

#### KQED: The Last Ice Age {#6.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogVGhlIExhc3QgSWNlIEFnZQ.._8-mcq}

Imagine a vast grassy ecosystem covered with herds of elephants, bison,
and camels stretching as far as the eye can see. Africa? Maybe. But this
also describes Northern California at the end of the last Ice Age. What
happened to all this wildlife? Were they over-hunted and killed off? Did
global warming destroy their populations? Scientists are not sure, but
this relatively recent loss of life does raise many interesting
questions. See *Ice Age Bay Area* at
[http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/ice-age-bay-area2](ice-age-bay-area2)

**In biology, what would classification refer to?**

There are millions and millions of species, so classifying organisms
into proper categories can be a difficult task. To make it easier for
all scientists to do, a classification system had to be developed.

### Linnaean Classification {#6.html#x-ck12-TGlubmFlYW4gQ2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._9-c75}

The evolution of life on Earth over the past 4 billion years has
resulted in a huge variety of species. For more than 2,000 years, humans
have been trying to classify the great diversity of life. The science of
classifying organisms is called **taxonomy.** Classification is an
important step in understanding the present diversity and past
evolutionary history of life on Earth.

All modern classification systems have their roots in the **Linnaean
classification** system. It was developed by Swedish botanist Carolus
Linnaeus in the 1700s. He tried to classify all living things that were
known at his time. He grouped together organisms that shared obvious
physical traits, such as number of legs or shape of leaves. For his
contribution, Linnaeus is known as the “father of taxonomy.” You can
learn more about Linnaeus and his system of classification by watching
the video at this link:
[http://teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video\_id=169889](viewVideo.php?video_id=169889)
.

The Linnaean system of classification consists of a hierarchy of
groupings, called **taxa** (singular, taxon). Taxa range from the
kingdom to the species (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTE0LUNsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u) ). The
**kingdom** is the largest and most inclusive grouping. It consists of
organisms that share just a few basic similarities. Examples are the
plant and animal kingdoms. The **species** is the smallest and most
exclusive grouping. It consists of organisms that are similar enough to
produce fertile offspring together. Closely related species are grouped
together in a **genus.**

**Figure 6.19**

Linnaean Classification System: Classification of the Human Species.
This chart shows the taxa of the Linnaean classification system. Each
taxon is a subdivision of the taxon below it in the chart. For example,
a species is a subdivision of a genus. The classification of humans is
given in the chart as an example.

</div>

#### Binomial Nomenclature {#6.html#x-ck12-Qmlub21pYWwgTm9tZW5jbGF0dXJl_9-tjy}

Perhaps the single greatest contribution Linnaeus made to science was
his method of naming species. This method, called **binomial
nomenclature** , gives each species a unique, two-word Latin name
consisting of the genus name and the species name. An example is *Homo
sapiens* , the two-word Latin name for humans. It literally means “wise
human.” This is a reference to our big brains.

Why is having two names so important? It is similar to people having a
first and a last name. You may know several people with the first name
Michael, but adding Michael’s last name usually pins down exactly whom
you mean. In the same way, having two names uniquely identifies a
species.

#### Revisions in Linnaean Classification {#6.html#x-ck12-UmV2aXNpb25zIGluIExpbm5hZWFuIENsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u_9-oz4}

Linnaeus published his classification system in the 1700s. Since then,
many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of many
organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that
Linnaeus’s system of classification needed revision.

A major change to the Linnaean system was the addition of a new taxon
called the domain. A **domain** is a taxon that is larger and more
inclusive than the kingdom. Most biologists agree there are three
domains of life on Earth: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota (see
**Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTE1LVRocmVlLURvbWFpbi1DbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg..)
). Both Bacteria and Archaea consist of single-celled prokaryotes.
Eukaryota consists of all eukaryotes, from single-celled protists to
humans. This domain includes the Animalia (animals), Plantae (plants),
Fungi (fungi), and Protista (protists) kingdoms.

three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Humans and other animals
belong to the Eukarya domain. From this tree, organisms that make up the

Archaea than Bacteria.

**Can two different species be related?**

Of course they can. For example, there are many different species of
mammals, or of one type of mammal, such as mice. And they are all
related. In other words, how close or how far apart did they separate
from a common ancestor during evolution? Determining how different
species are evolutionarily related can be a tremendous task.

### Phylogenetic Classification {#6.html#x-ck12-UGh5bG9nZW5ldGljIENsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u_10-z3p}

Linnaeus classified organisms based on obvious physical traits.
Basically, organisms were grouped together if they looked alike. After
Darwin published his theory of evolution in the 1800s, scientists looked
for a way to classify organisms that showed phylogeny. **Phylogeny** is
the evolutionary history of a group of related organisms. It is
represented by a **phylogenetic tree** , like the one in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTE2LXBoeWxvZ2VuZXRpYy10cmVl) .

species are related to each other through common ancestors. Do you see
why Species 1 and 2 are more closely related to each other than either

</div>

One way of classifying organisms that shows phylogeny is by using the
clade. A **clade** is a group of organisms that includes an ancestor and
all of its descendants. Clades are based on **cladistics** . This is a
method of comparing traits in related species to determine
ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are represented by
**cladograms** , like the one in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTA5LTE3LWNsYWRlcw..) . This cladogram
represents the mammal and reptile clades. The reptile clade includes
birds. It shows that birds evolved from reptiles. Linnaeus classified
mammals, reptiles, and birds in separate classes. This masks their
evolutionary relationships.

**What's that big red pouch?**

The Frigate bird of the Galápagos Islands. This bird can be found
throughout the tropical Atlantic down to the Galápagos Islands and
Ecuador, but not in Europe or South America, so Darwin may never have
come across one until he landed on the Galápagos. Such a unique creature
was bound to make a naturalist such as Darwin wonder why. Why do they
look the way they do? What's that big red pouch? What are the
advantages?

### Darwin’s Theory {#6.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2lu4oCZcyBUaGVvcnk._11-a8l}

The Englishman **Charles Darwin** is one of the most famous scientists
who ever lived. His place in the history of science is well deserved.
Darwin’s theory of evolution represents a giant leap in human
understanding. It explains and unifies all of biology.

An overview of evolution can be seen at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcjgWov7mTM](watch?v=GcjgWov7mTM)

> As you view *Introduction to Evolution and Natural Selection,* focus
> on the following concepts:
>
> 1.  the meaning of "evolution,"
> 2.  the relationship between evolution and natural selection,
> 3.  the relationship between natural selection and variation,
> 4.  the evolution of the peppered moth.

Darwin’s theory of evolution actually contains two major ideas:

1.  One idea is that evolution occurs. In other words, organisms change
    over time. Life on Earth has changed as descendants diverged from
    common ancestors in the past.
2.  The other idea is that evolution occurs by **natural selection** .
    Natural selection is the process that results in living things with
    beneficial traits producing more offspring than others. This results
    in changes in the traits of living things over time.

In Darwin’s day, most people believed that all species were created at
the same time and remained unchanged thereafter. They also believed that
Earth was only about 6,000 years old. Therefore, Darwin’s ideas
revolutionized biology. How did Darwin come up with these important
ideas? It all started when he went on a voyage.

#### The Voyage of the *Beagle* {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFZveWFnZSBvZiB0aGU._11-irw}

In 1831, when Darwin was just 22 years old, he set sail on a scientific
expedition on a ship called the ***HMS Beagle*** . He was the
**naturalist** on the voyage. As a naturalist, it was his job to observe
and collect specimens of plants, animals, rocks, and fossils wherever
the expedition went ashore. The route the ship took and the stops they
made are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTAxLUJlYWdsZS12b3lhZ2U.) . You can learn
more about Darwin’s voyage at this link:

Voyage of the *Beagle* . This map shows the route of Darwin’s 5-year
voyage on the *HMS Beagle* . Each stop along the way is labeled. Darwin
and the others on board eventually circled the globe.

</div>

Darwin was fascinated by nature, so he loved his job on the *Beagle* .
He spent more than 3 years of the 5-year trip exploring nature on
distant continents and islands. While he was away, a former teacher
published Darwin’s accounts of his observations. By the time Darwin
finally returned to England, he had become famous as a naturalist.

#### Darwin’s Observations {#6.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2lu4oCZcyBPYnNlcnZhdGlvbnM._11-01k}

During the long voyage, Darwin made many observations that helped him
form his theory of evolution. For example:

-   He visited tropical rainforests and other new habitats where he saw
    many plants and animals he had never seen before (see **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTAyLUdhbGFwYWdvcy1zcGVjaWVz) ). This
    impressed him with the great diversity of life.
-   He experienced an earthquake that lifted the ocean floor 2.7 meters
    (9 feet) above sea level. He also found rocks containing fossil sea
    shells in mountains high above sea level. These observations
    suggested that continents and oceans had changed dramatically over
    time and continue to change in dramatic ways.
-   He visited rock ledges that had clearly once been beaches that had
    gradually built up over time. This suggested that slow, steady
    processes also change Earth’s surface.
-   He dug up fossils of gigantic extinct mammals, such as the ground
    sloth (see **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTAyLUdhbGFwYWdvcy1zcGVjaWVz) ). This
    was hard evidence that organisms looked very different in the past.
    It suggested that living things—like Earth’s surface—change
    over time.

Islands** (see map in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTAzLWdhbGFwYWdvcy1tYXA.) ). This is a
group of 16 small volcanic islands 966 kilometers (600 miles) off the
west coast of Ecuador, South America.

Individual Galápagos islands differ from one another in important ways.
Some are rocky and dry. Others have better soil and more rainfall.
Darwin noticed that the plants and animals on the different islands also
differed. For example, the giant tortoises on one island had
saddle-shaped shells, while those on another island had dome-shaped
shells (see **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA0LXR1cnRsZXM.)
). People who lived on the islands could even tell the island a turtle
came from by its shell. This started Darwin thinking about the origin of
species. He wondered how each island came to have its own type of
tortoise.

**How do structures like this form?**

Cathedral Rock in Sedona, Arizona. Though Arizona was not on Darwin's
itinerary, the work of others that saw and studied Earth's changing
landscape influenced him. One geologist, Charles Lyell, proposed that
gradual geological processes have shaped Earth’s surface, inferring that
Earth must be far older than most people believed. How else could
structures like those shown here develop? If in fact Earth was much
older then just 6,000 years, Darwin believed there would have been
plenty of time for evolution to occur.

### Influences on Darwin {#6.html#x-ck12-SW5mbHVlbmNlcyBvbiBEYXJ3aW4._12-pya}

Science, like evolution, always builds on the past. Darwin didn’t
develop his theory completely on his own. He was influenced by the ideas
of earlier thinkers.

#### Earlier Thinkers Who Influenced Darwin {#6.html#x-ck12-RWFybGllciBUaGlua2VycyBXaG8gSW5mbHVlbmNlZCBEYXJ3aW4._12-fg0}

1.  Jean Baptiste **Lamarck** (1744–1829) was an important
    French naturalist. He was one of the first scientists to propose
    that species change over time. However, Lamarck was wrong about how
    species change. His idea of the **inheritance of acquired
    characteristics** is incorrect. Traits an organism develops during
    its own life time cannot be passed on to offspring, as
    Lamarck believed.
2.  Charles **Lyell** (1797–1875) was a well-known English geologist.
    Darwin took Lyell's book, *Principles of Geology,* with him on the
    *Beagle* . In the book, Lyell argued that gradual geological
    processes have gradually shaped Earth’s surface. From this, Lyell
    inferred that Earth must be far older than most people believed.
3.  Thomas **Malthus** (1766–1834) was an English economist. He wrote an
    essay titled *On Population* . In the essay, Malthus argued that
    human populations grow faster than the resources they depend on.
    When populations become too large, famine and disease break out. In
    the end, this keeps populations in check by killing off the
    weakest members.

#### Artificial Selection {#6.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aWZpY2lhbCBTZWxlY3Rpb24._12-134}

These weren’t the only influences on Darwin. He was also aware that
humans could breed plants and animals to have useful traits. By
selecting which animals were allowed to reproduce, they could change an
organism’s traits. The pigeons in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA1LUJpcmQtQ29tcG9zaXRl) are good
examples. Darwin called this type of change in organisms **artificial
selection** . He used the word ‘‘artificial’’ to distinguish it from
natural selection.

#### Wallace’s Theory {#6.html#x-ck12-V2FsbGFjZeKAmXMgVGhlb3J5_12-bfw}

Did you ever hear the saying that “great minds think alike?” It
certainly applies to Charles Darwin and another English naturalist named
Alfred Russel **Wallace** . Wallace lived at about the same time as
Darwin. He also traveled to distant places to study nature. Wallace
wasn’t as famous as Darwin. However, he developed basically the same
theory of evolution. While working in distant lands, Wallace sent Darwin
a paper he had written. In the paper, Wallace explained his evolutionary
theory. This served to confirm what Darwin already thought.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-jad}

-   Darwin was influenced by other early thinkers, including Lamarck,
    Lyell, and Malthus.
-   Darwin was also influenced by his knowledge of artificial selection.
-   Wallace’s paper on evolution confirmed Darwin’s ideas.

**How do new species form?**

This is the only illustration in Charles Darwin's 1859 book *On the
Origin of Species* , showing his ideas describing the divergence of
species from common ancestors.

### Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection {#6.html#x-ck12-RGFyd2lu4oCZcyBUaGVvcnkgb2YgRXZvbHV0aW9uIGJ5IE5hdHVyYWwgU2VsZWN0aW9u_13-ulm}

Darwin spent many years thinking about the work of Lamarck, Lyell, and
Malthus, what he had seen on his voyage, and artificial selection. What
did all this mean? How did it all fit together? It fits together in
Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. It’s easy to see how
all of these influences helped shape Darwin’s ideas.

evolution see

#### Evolution of Darwin’s Theory {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIERhcndpbuKAmXMgVGhlb3J5_13-i7f}

It took Darwin years to form his theory of evolution by natural
selection. His reasoning went like this:

1.  Like Lamarck, Darwin assumed that species can change over time. The
    fossils he found helped convince him of that.
2.  From Lyell, Darwin saw that Earth and its life were very old. Thus,
    there had been enough time for evolution to produce the great
    diversity of life Darwin had observed.
3.  From Malthus, Darwin knew that populations could grow faster than
    their resources. This “overproduction of offspring” led to a
    “struggle for existence,” in Darwin’s words.
4.  From artificial selection, Darwin knew that some offspring have
    variations that occur by chance, and that can be inherited. In
    nature, offspring with certain variations might be more likely to
    survive the “struggle for existence” and reproduce. If so, they
    would pass their favorable variations to their offspring.
5.  Darwin coined the term **fitness** to refer to an organism’s
    relative ability to survive and produce fertile offspring. Nature
    selects the variations that are most useful. Therefore, he called
    this type of selection **natural selection** .
6.  Darwin knew artificial selection could change domestic species
    over time. He inferred that natural selection could also change
    species over time. In fact, he thought that if a species changed
    enough, it might evolve into a new species.

Wallace’s paper not only confirmed Darwin’s ideas. It also pushed him to
finish his book, *On the Origin of Species* . Published in 1859, this
book changed science forever. It clearly spelled out Darwin’s theory of
evolution by natural selection and provided convincing arguments and
evidence to support it.

#### Applying Darwin’s Theory {#6.html#x-ck12-QXBwbHlpbmcgRGFyd2lu4oCZcyBUaGVvcnk._13-vrd}

The following example applies Darwin’s theory. It explains how giraffes
came to have such long necks (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA2LUdpcmFmZmVz) ).

-   In the past, giraffes had short necks. But there was chance
    variation in neck length. Some giraffes had necks a little longer
    than the average.
-   Then, as now, giraffes fed on tree leaves. Perhaps the environment
    changed, and leaves became scarcer. There would be more giraffes
    than the trees could support. Thus, there would be a “struggle for
    existence.”
-   Giraffes with longer necks had an advantage. They could reach leaves
    other giraffes could not. Therefore, the long-necked giraffes were
    more likely to survive and reproduce. They had greater fitness.
-   These giraffes passed the long-neck trait to their offspring. Each
    generation, the population contained more long-necked giraffes.
    Eventually, all giraffes had long necks.

**Figure 6.28**

Giraffes feed on leaves high in trees. Their long necks allow them to
reach leaves that other ground animals cannot.

</div>

As this example shows, chance variations may help a species survive if
the environment changes. Variation among species helps ensure that at
least one will be able to survive environmental change.

Selection and the Owl Butterfly’’ :

#### KQED: Chasing Beetles, Finding Darwin {#6.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogQ2hhc2luZyBCZWV0bGVzLCBGaW5kaW5nIERhcndpbg.._13-opc}

It's been over 150 years since Charles Darwin published *On the Origin
of Species* . Yet his ideas remain as central to scientific exploration
as ever, and has been called the unifying concept of all biology. Is
evolution continuing today? Of course it is.

QUEST follows researchers who are still unlocking the mysteries of
evolution, including entomologist David Kavanaugh of the California
Academy of Sciences, who predicted that a new beetle species would be
found on the Trinity Alps of Northern California. See
[http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/chasing-beetles-finding-darwin2](chasing-beetles-finding-darwin2)
for more information.

It's rare for a biologist to predict the discovery of a new species. For
his prediction, Kavanaugh drew inspiration from Darwin's own 1862
prediction. When Darwin observed an orchid from Madagascar with a
foot-long nectar, he predicted that a pollinator would be found with a
tongue long enough to reach the nectar inside the orchid's very thin,
elongated nectar ‘‘pouch’’, though he had never seen such a bird or
insect. Darwin's prediction was based on his finding that all species
are related to each other and that some of them evolve together,
developing similar **adaptations** . Darwin's prediction came true in
1903, when a moth was discovered in Madagascar with a long, thin
proboscis, which it uncurls to reach the nectar in the orchid's nectar.
In the process of feeding from the orchid, the moth serves as its
pollinator. The moth was given the scientific name *Xanthopan morganii
praedicta* , in honor of Darwin’s prediction.

As you view *Chasing Beetles, Finding Darwin,* focus on the following
concepts:

1.  the relationship between studying beetles and evolution,
2.  the development of new species,
3.  the relationship between genetic make-up of an organism and
    evolution,
4.  the role of *beneficial* mutations,
5.  the role of ‘‘habitat islands’’,
6.  the selection for certain traits among breeders, such as pigeon
    breeders,
7.  the importance of identifying new species.

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-vb4}

-   Darwin's book *On the Origin of Species* clearly spells out
    his theory.
-   Darwin's book also provides evidence and logic to support that
    evolution occurs and that it occurs by natural selection.

**Would this be evidence of evolution?**

Fossils, like this dinosaur fossil, provide evidence of species that
lived in the past and have since gone extinct. In other words, these
fossils are evidence of evolution.

### Fossil Evidence {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9zc2lsIEV2aWRlbmNl_14-70f}

In his book *On the Origin of Species* , Darwin included evidence to
show that evolution had taken place. He also made logical arguments to
support his theory that evolution occurs by natural selection. Since
Darwin’s time, much more evidence has been gathered. The evidence
includes a huge number of fossils. It also includes more detailed
knowledge of living things, right down to their DNA.

**Fossils** are a window into the past. They provide clear evidence that
evolution has occurred. Scientists who find and study fossils are called
**paleontologists** . How do they use fossils to understand the past?
Consider the example of the horse, shown in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA3LU1vZGVybi1Ib3JzZQ..) . The fossil
record shows how the horse evolved.

**Figure 6.29**

Evolution of the horse. Fossil evidence, depicted by the skeletal
fragments, demonstrates evolutionary milestones in this process. Notice
the 57 million year evolution of the horse leg bones and teeth.
Especially obvious is the transformation of the leg bones from having
four distinct digits to that of today's horse.

</div>

The oldest horse fossils show what the earliest horses were like. They
were about the size of a fox, and they had four long toes. Other
evidence shows they lived in wooded marshlands, where they probably ate
soft leaves. Through time, the climate became drier, and grasslands
slowly replaced the marshes. Later fossils show that horses changed as
well.

-   They became taller, which would help them see predators while they
    fed in tall grasses.
-   They evolved a single large toe that eventually became a hoof. This
    would help them run swiftly and escape predators.
-   Their molars (back teeth) became longer and covered with cement.
    This would allow them to grind tough grasses and grass seeds without
    wearing out their teeth.

Similar fossil evidence demonstrates the evolution of the whale, moving
from the land into the sea. An animation of this process can be viewed

**Is this evidence of evolution?**

Take a close look at this gorilla hand. The similarities to a human hand
are remarkable. Comparing anatomy, and characterizing the similarities
and differences, provides evidence of evolution.

### Evidence from Living Species {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZpZGVuY2UgZnJvbSBMaXZpbmcgU3BlY2llcw.._15-muv}

Just as Darwin did many years ago, today’s scientists study living
species to learn about evolution. They compare the anatomy, embryos, and
DNA of modern organisms to understand how they evolved.

#### Comparative Anatomy {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFyYXRpdmUgQW5hdG9teQ.._15-xdi}

**Comparative anatomy** is the study of the similarities and differences
in the structures of different species. Similar body parts may be
homologies or analogies. Both provide evidence for evolution.

**Homologous structures** are structures that are similar in related
organisms because they were inherited from a common ancestor. These
structures may or may not have the same function in the descendants.
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA4LWhvbW9sb2d5) shows the
hands of several different mammals. They all have the same basic pattern
of bones. They inherited this pattern from a common ancestor. However,
their forelimbs now have different functions.

**Figure 6.30**

The forelimbs of all mammals have the same basic bone structure.

</div>

**Analogous structures** are structures that are similar in unrelated
organisms. The structures are similar because they evolved to do the
same job, not because they were inherited from a common ancestor. For
example, the wings of bats and birds, shown in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTA5LUJhdHMtQmlyZHM.) , look similar on
the outside. They also have the same function. However, wings evolved
independently in the two groups of animals. This is apparent when you
compare the pattern of bones inside the wings.

Wings of bats and birds serve the same function. Look closely at the
bones inside the wings. The differences show they developed from

</div>

#### Comparative Embryology {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFyYXRpdmUgRW1icnlvbG9neQ.._15-7xl}

**Comparative embryology** is the study of the similarities and
differences in the embryos of different species. Similarities in embryos
are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example,
have gill slits and tails. Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their
gill slits by adulthood. Some of them also lose their tail. In humans,
the tail is reduced to the tail bone. Thus, similarities organisms share
as embryos may be gone by adulthood. This is why it is valuable to
compare organisms in the embryonic stage. See
[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/04/2/pdf/l\_042\_03.pdf](l_042_03.pdf)
for additional information and a comparative diagram of human, monkey,
pig, chicken and salamander embryos.

#### Vestigial Structures {#6.html#x-ck12-VmVzdGlnaWFsIFN0cnVjdHVyZXM._15-h1m}

Structures like the human tail bone and whale pelvis are called
**vestigial structures** . Evolution has reduced their size because the
structures are no longer used. The human appendix is another example of
a vestigial structure. It is a tiny remnant of a once-larger organ. In a
distant ancestor, it was needed to digest food. It serves no purpose in
humans today. Why do you think structures that are no longer used shrink
in size? Why might a full-sized, unused structure reduce an organism’s
fitness?

#### Comparing DNA {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFyaW5nIEROQQ.._15-flm}

Darwin could compare only the anatomy and embryos of living things.
Today, scientists can compare their DNA. Similar DNA sequences are the
strongest evidence for evolution from a common ancestor. More
similarities in the DNA sequence is evidence for a closer evolutionary
relationship. Look at the cladogram in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTExLWh1bWFuLWFwZS1jbGFkb2dyYW0.) . It
shows how humans and apes are related based on their DNA sequences.

#### KQED: The Reverse Evolution Machine {#6.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogVGhlIFJldmVyc2UgRXZvbHV0aW9uIE1hY2hpbmU._15-loq}

In search of the common ancestor of all mammals, University of
California Santa Cruz scientist David Haussler is pulling a complete
reversal. Instead of studying fossils, he's comparing the genomes of
living mammals to construct a map of our common ancestors' DNA. He also
specializes in studying the DNA of extinct animals, asking how the DNA
has changed over millions of years to create today's species. His
technique, referred to as computational genomics, holds promise for
providing a better picture of how life evolved. See

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-lxq}

-   Scientists compare the anatomy, embryos, and DNA of living things to
    understand how they evolved.
-   Evidence for evolution is provided by homologous structures. These
    are structures shared by related organisms that were inherited from
    a common ancestor.
-   Other evidence for evolution is provided by analogous structures.
    These are structures that unrelated organisms share because they
    evolved to do the same job.
-   Comparing DNA sequences provided some of the strongest evidence of
    evolutionary relationships.

**Why would geography have anything to do with evolution?**

Similar to "how did the chicken cross the road?" but on a much grander
scale. How did the animal cross Europe and into Asia? Or Asia into
America? How did anything get into Australia?

### Evidence from Biogeography {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZpZGVuY2UgZnJvbSBCaW9nZW9ncmFwaHk._16-yrx}

**Biogeography** is the study of how and why plants and animals live
where they do. It provides more evidence for evolution. Let’s consider
the camel family as an example.

#### Biogeography of Camels: An Example {#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvZ2VvZ3JhcGh5IG9mIENhbWVsczogQW4gRXhhbXBsZQ.._16-gd0}

Today, the camel family includes different types of camels. They are
shown in **Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTEyLWNhbWVscw..) .
All of today’s camels are descended from the same camel ancestors. These
ancestors lived in North America about a million years ago.

**Figure 6.33**

Camel Migrations and Present-Day Variation. Members of the camel family
now live in different parts of the world. They differ from one another
in a number of traits. However, they share basic similarities. This is
because they all evolved from a common ancestor. What differences and
similarities do you see?

</div>

Early North American camels migrated to other places. Some went to East
Asia. They crossed a land bridge during the last ice age. A few of them
made it all the way to Africa. Others went to South America. They
crossed the Isthmus of Panama. Once camels reached these different
places, they evolved independently. They evolved adaptations that suited
them for the particular environment where they lived. Through natural
selection, descendants of the original camel ancestors evolved the
diversity they have today.

#### Island Biogeography {#6.html#x-ck12-SXNsYW5kIEJpb2dlb2dyYXBoeQ.._16-aqv}

The biogeography of islands yields some of the best evidence for
evolution. Consider the birds called finches that Darwin studied on the
Galápagos Islands (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTEzLUZpbmNoZXM.) ). All of the finches
probably descended from one bird that arrived on the islands from South
America. Until the first bird arrived, there had never been birds on the
islands. The first bird was a seed eater. It evolved into many finch
species. Each species was adapted for a different type of food. This is
an example of **adaptive radiation** . This is the process by which a
single species evolves into many new species to fill available niches.

#### Eyewitness to Evolution {#6.html#x-ck12-RXlld2l0bmVzcyB0byBFdm9sdXRpb24._16-z3z}

In the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galápagos
Islands. They wanted to re-study Darwin’s finches. They spent more than
30 years on the project. Their efforts paid off. They were able to
observe evolution by natural selection actually taking place.

While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result,
fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks
could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks
could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the
small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived
and reproduced (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTE0LUZpbmNoZXMtZGF0YQ..) ). Within 2
years, the average beak size in the finch population increased.
Evolution by natural selection had occurred.

**Jeans vs. Genes. What's the difference?**

Plenty. One you have for life, the other just lasts a few years. One is
the basis for the passing of traits from one generation to the next.
Some jeans you change frequently. But what happens when you change a
gene's frequency? Essentially, evolution is a change in gene frequencies
within a population.

### Genes in Populations {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXMgaW4gUG9wdWxhdGlvbnM._17-xbt}

Darwin knew that heritable variations are needed for evolution to occur.
However, he knew nothing about Mendel’s laws of genetics. Mendel’s laws
were rediscovered in the early 1900s. Only then could scientists fully
understand the process of evolution. We now know that variations of
traits are heritable. These variations are determined by different
**alleles** . We also know that evolution is due to a change in alleles
over time. How long a time? That depends on the scale of evolution.

-   **Microevolution** occurs over a relatively short period of time
    within a population or species. The Grants observed this level of
    evolution in Darwin’s finches (see the "Biogeography" concept).
-   **Macroevolution** occurs over geologic time above the level of
    the species. The fossil record reflects this level of evolution. It
    results from microevolution taking place over many generations.

Remember that individuals do not evolve. Their **genes** do not change
over time. The unit of evolution is the population. A **population**
consists of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. In
terms of evolution, the population is assumed to be a relatively closed
group. This means that most mating takes place within the population.
The science that focuses on evolution within populations is **population
genetics** . It is a combination of evolutionary theory and Mendelian
genetics.

#### Gene Pool {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VuZSBQb29s_17-jrn}

The genetic makeup of an individual is the individual’s **genotype** . A
population consists of many genotypes. Altogether, they make up the
population’s gene pool. The **gene pool** consists of all the genes of
all the members of the population. For each gene, the gene pool includes
all the different alleles for the gene that exist in the population. For
a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of the
different alleles in the gene pool.

#### Allele Frequencies {#6.html#x-ck12-QWxsZWxlIEZyZXF1ZW5jaWVz_17-t1v}

**Allele frequency** is how often an allele occurs in a gene pool
relative to the other alleles for that gene. Look at the example in the
**Table** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YWxsZWxlcy1nZW5lLXBvb2w.) . The
population in the table has 100 members. In a sexually reproducing
species, each member of the population has two copies of each gene.
Therefore, the total number of copies of each gene in the gene pool is
200. The gene in the example exists in the gene pool in two forms,
alleles *A* and *a* . Knowing the genotypes of each population member,
we can count the number of alleles of each type in the gene pool. The
table shows how this is done.

  **Genotype**   **Number of Individuals in the Population with that Genotype**   **Number of Allele** ***A*** **Contributed to the Gene Pool by that Genotype**   **Number of Allele** ***a*** **Contributed to the Gene Pool by that Genotype**
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *AA*           50                                                               50 × 2 = 100                                                                     50 × 0 = 0
  *Aa*           40                                                               40 × 1 = 40                                                                      40 × 1 = 40
  *aa*           10                                                               10 × 0 = 0                                                                       10 × 2 = 20
  Totals         100                                                              140                                                                              60

Let the letter *p* stand for the frequency of allele *A* . Let the
letter *q* stand for the frequency of allele *a* . We can calculate *p*
and *q* as follows:

-   *p* = number of *A* alleles/total number of alleles = 140/200 = 0.7
-   *q* = number of *a* alleles/total number of alleles = 60/200 = 0.3
-   Notice that *p* + *q* = 1.

Evolution occurs in a population when allele frequencies change over
time. What causes allele frequencies to change? That question was
answered by Godfrey Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg in 1908 (see the
*Hardy-Weinberg Theorem* concept).

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-sky}

    or species. Macroevolution occurs over geologic time above the level

**Why is balance important?**

To these individuals, the importance of maintaining balance is obvious.
If balance, or equilibrium, is maintained within a population's genes,
can evolution occur? No. But maintaining this type of balance today is
difficult.

### The Hardy-Weinberg Theorem {#6.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEhhcmR5LVdlaW5iZXJnIFRoZW9yZW0._18-8he}

Godfrey Hardy was an English mathematician. Wilhelm Weinberg was a
German doctor. Each worked alone to come up with the founding principle
of population genetics. Today, that principle is called the
**Hardy-Weinberg theorem** . It shows that allele frequencies do not
change in a population if certain conditions are met. Such a population
is said to be in **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium** . The conditions for
equilibrium are:

1.  No new **mutations** are occurring. Therefore, no new alleles are
    being created.
2.  There is no **migration** . In other words, no one is moving into or
    out of the population.
3.  The population is very large.
4.  Mating is at random in the population. This means that individuals
    do not choose mates based on genotype.
5.  There is no natural selection. Thus, all members of the population
    have an equal chance of reproducing and passing their genes to the
    next generation.

When all these conditions are met, allele frequencies stay the same.
Genotype frequencies also remain constant. In addition, genotype
frequencies can be expressed in terms of allele frequencies, as the
**Table** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6aGFyZHktd2VpbmJlcmc.) shows.
For a further explanation of this theorem, see **Solving Hardy Weinberg
Problems** at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPkOAnK20kw](watch?v=xPkOAnK20kw) .

Hardy and Weinberg used mathematics to describe an equilibrium
population ( *p* = frequency of *A* , *q* = frequency of *a* , so *p* +
*q* = 1): *p* ^2^ + 2 *pq* + *q* ^2^ = 1. Using the genotype frequencies
shown in **Table** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6aGFyZHktd2VpbmJlcmc.)
, if *p* = 0.4, what is the frequency of the *AA* genotype?

  **Genotype**   **Genotype Frequency**
  -------------- ------------------------
  *AA*           *p* ^2^
  *Aa*           2 *pq*
  *aa*           *q* ^2^

**How do a population's genes change?**

Remember, without change, there cannot be evolution. Together, the
forces that change a population's gene frequencies are the driving
mechanisms behind evolution.

### Forces of Evolution {#6.html#x-ck12-Rm9yY2VzIG9mIEV2b2x1dGlvbg.._19-gpc}

The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are unlikely to be met in
real populations. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem also describes populations
in which allele frequencies are not changing. By definition, such
populations are not evolving. How does the theorem help us understand
evolution in the real world?

From the theorem, we can infer factors that cause allele frequencies to
change. These factors are the "forces of evolution." There are four such
forces: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection.
Natural selection will be discussed in the "Natural Selection" concept.

#### Mutation {#6.html#x-ck12-TXV0YXRpb24._19-ihz}

**Mutation** creates new genetic variation in a gene pool. It is how all
new alleles first arise. In sexually reproducing species, the mutations
that matter for evolution are those that occur in gametes. Only these
mutations can be passed to offspring. For any given gene, the chance of
a mutation occurring in a given gamete is very low. Thus, mutations
alone do not have much effect on allele frequencies. However, mutations
provide the genetic variation needed for other forces of evolution to
act.

#### Gene Flow {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VuZSBGbG93_19-mil}

**Gene flow** occurs when individuals move into or out of a population.
If the rate of migration is high, this can have a significant effect on
allele frequencies. The allele frequencies of both the population they
leave and the population they enter may change.

During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, many American servicemen
had children with Vietnamese women. Most of the servicemen returned to
the United States after the war. However, they left copies of their
genes behind in their offspring. In this way, they changed the allele
frequencies in the Vietnamese gene pool. Was the gene pool of the
American population also affected? Why or why not?

#### Genetic Drift {#6.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBEcmlmdA.._19-xvf}

**Genetic drift** is a random change in allele frequencies that occurs
in a small population. When a small number of parents produce just a few
offspring, allele frequencies in the offspring may differ, by chance,
from allele frequencies in the parents.

This is like tossing a coin. If you toss a coin just a few times, you
may, by chance, get more or less than the expected 50 percent heads or
tails. In a small population, you may also, by chance, get different
allele frequencies than expected in the next generation. In this way,
allele frequencies may drift over time.

There are two special conditions under which genetic drift occurs. They
are called bottleneck effect and founder effect.

1.  **Bottleneck effect** occurs when a population suddenly gets
    much smaller. This might happen because of a natural disaster such
    as a forest fire. By chance, allele frequencies of the survivors may
    be different from those of the original population.
2.  **Founder effect** occurs when a few individuals start, or found, a
    new population. By chance, allele frequencies of the founders may be
    different from allele frequencies of the population they left. An
    example is described in the **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTE1LUFtaXNoLUdlbmV0aWMtZGlzZWFzZQ..) .

### Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-ek6}

-   There are four forces of evolution: mutation, gene flow, genetic
    drift, and natural selection.

**What's fitness?**

Does this type of fitness have anything to do with natural selection?
Usually not. There are countless ways in which an organism can be more
"fit," or better adapted to its habitat. And we probably do not know
about most of these adaptations.

### Natural Selection {#6.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBTZWxlY3Rpb24._20-wla}

**Natural selection** occurs when there are differences in fitness among
members of a population. As a result, some individuals pass more genes
to the next generation. This causes allele frequencies to change.

#### Sickle Cell and Natural Selection {#6.html#x-ck12-U2lja2xlIENlbGwgYW5kIE5hdHVyYWwgU2VsZWN0aW9u_20-usa}

The example of sickle-cell anemia is described in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTE2LXNpY2tsZS1jZWxs) and **Table**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6c2lja2xlLWNlbGw.) . It shows how natural

**Figure 6.37**

</div>

  **Genotype**   **Phenotype**                                            **Fitness**
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------
  *AA*           100% normal hemoglobin                                   Somewhat reduced fitness because of no resistance to malaria
  *AS*           Enough normal hemoglobin to prevent sickle-cell anemia   Highest fitness because of resistance to malaria
  *SS*           100% abnormal hemoglobin, causing sickle-cell anemia     Greatly reduced fitness because of sickle-cell anemia

Here’s how natural selection can keep a harmful allele in a gene pool:

-   The allele ( *S* ) for sickle-cell anemia is a harmful
    autosomal recessive. It is caused by a mutation in the normal allele
    ( *A* ) for hemoglobin (a protein on red blood cells).
-   Malaria is a deadly tropical disease. It is common in many
    African populations.
-   Heterozygotes ( *AS* ) with the sickle-cell allele are resistant
    to malaria. Therefore, they are more likely to survive
    and reproduce. This keeps the *S* allele in the gene pool.

The sickle-cell example shows that fitness depends on phenotypes. It
also shows that fitness may depend on the environment. What do you think
might happen if malaria was eliminated in an African population with a
relatively high frequency of the *S* allele? How might the fitness of
the different genotypes change? How might this affect the frequency of
the *S* allele?

#### Natural Selection and Polygenic Traits {#6.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJhbCBTZWxlY3Rpb24gYW5kIFBvbHlnZW5pYyBUcmFpdHM._20-8bm}

Sickle-cell trait is controlled by a single gene. Natural selection for
polygenic traits is more complex, unless you just look at phenotypes.
Three ways that natural selection can affect phenotypes are shown in
**Figure** [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTE3LVNlbGVjdGlvbg..) . You
can also watch an animation comparing the three ways at the link below.
[http://bcs.whfreeman.com/thelifewire/content/chp23/2301s.swf](2301s.swf)
.

1.  **Stabilizing selection** occurs when phenotypes at both extremes of
    the phenotypic distribution are selected against. This narrows the
    range of variation. An example is human birth weight. Babies that
    are very large or very small at birth are less likely to survive.
    This keeps birth weight within a relatively narrow range.
2.  **Directional selection** occurs when one of two extreme phenotypes
    is selected for. This shifts the distribution toward that extreme.
    This is the type of natural selection that the Grants observed in
    the beak size of Galápagos finches.
3.  **Disruptive selection** occurs when phenotypes in the middle of the
    range are selected against. This results in two overlapping
    phenotypes, one at each end of the distribution. An example is
    **sexual dimorphism** . This refers to differences between the
    phenotypes of males and females of the same species. In humans, for
    example, males and females have different heights and body shapes.

**How can a river influence evolution?**

Imagine a group of small organisms, such as mice, that become separated
by a mighty river. This group has now become isolated, and formed two
separate groups. The groups are obviously no longer able to breed
together. Over many generations, each group will evolve separately,
eventually forming two completely new species of mice.

### Origin of Species {#6.html#x-ck12-T3JpZ2luIG9mIFNwZWNpZXM._21-ntc}

**Macroevolution** is evolution over geologic time above the level of
the species. One of the main topics in macroevolution is how new species
arise. The process by which a new species evolves is called
**speciation** . How does speciation occur? How does one species evolve
into two or more new species?

To understand how a new species forms, it’s important to review what a
species is. A **species** is a group of organisms that can breed and
produce fertile offspring together in nature. For a new species to
arise, some members of a species must become reproductively isolated
from the rest of the species. This means they can no longer interbreed
with other members of the species. How does this happen? Usually they
become geographically isolated first.

#### Allopatric Speciation {#6.html#x-ck12-QWxsb3BhdHJpYyBTcGVjaWF0aW9u_21-ujl}

Assume that some members of a species become geographically separated
from the rest of the species. If they remain separated long enough, they
may evolve genetic differences. If the differences prevent them from
interbreeding with members of the original species, they have evolved
into a new species. Speciation that occurs in this way is called
**allopatric speciation** . An example is described in the **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTE4LUFsbG9wYXRyaWMtU3BlY2lhdGlvbi1pbi1LYWliYWItU3F1aXJyZWw.)

</div>

#### Sympatric Speciation {#6.html#x-ck12-U3ltcGF0cmljIFNwZWNpYXRpb24._21-4hc}

Less often, a new species arises without geographic separation. This is
called **sympatric speciation** . The following example shows one way
this can occur.

1.  Hawthorn flies lay eggs in hawthorn trees (see **Figure**
    [below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTE5LUhhd3Rob3JuLUNvbXBpbGF0aW9u) ).
    The eggs hatch into larvae that feed on hawthorn fruits. Both the
    flies and trees are native to the U.S.
2.  Apple trees were introduced to the U.S. and often grow near
    hawthorn trees. Some hawthorn flies started to lay eggs in nearby
    apple trees. When the eggs hatched, the larvae fed on apples.
3.  Over time, the two fly populations—those that fed on hawthorn trees
    and those that preferred apple trees—evolved reproductive isolation.
    Now they are reproductively isolated because they breed at
    different times. Their breeding season matches the season when the
    apple or hawthorn fruits mature.
4.  Because they rarely interbreed, the two populations of flies are
    evolving other genetic differences. They appear to be in the process
    of becoming separate species.

**How can a predator, such as a wolf, influence evolution?**

Wolves hunt caribou, chasing them down to capture them. The slower
caribou are more likely to become lunch or dinner, leaving the faster
individuals to reproduce. The resulting faster offspring will be even
more difficult for the wolves to catch, and only the fastest wolves - or
perhaps the wolves who are genetically capable of developing methods to
hunt very fast prey - will get enough food to survive. This is
coevolution in action.

### Coevolution {#6.html#x-ck12-Q29ldm9sdXRpb24._22-xfp}

Evolution occurs in response to a change in the environment.
Environmental change often involves other species of organisms. In fact,
species in symbiotic relationships tend to evolve together. This is
called **coevolution** . As one species changes, the other species must
also change in order to adapt.

Coevolution occurs in flowering plants and the species that pollinate
them. The flower and bird in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEwLTIwLUZsb3dlci1jb2V2b2x1dGlvbg..) are a
good example. They have evolved matching structures.

</div>

In coevolution, relationships may be positive for one species or both,
or may be an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. Flowering
plants depend on insects for pollination, so have evolved colors,
shapes, scents, and even food supplies that are attractive to certain
insect species. Insects, in turn, have evolved mouthparts, senses, and
flight patterns that allow them to respond to and benefit from specific
floral “offerings,” shown in the **Figure**

</div>

The **endosymbiotic theory** describes a special form of co-evolution:
mitochondria and chloroplasts evolve within eukaryote cells, yet because
these organelles have their own DNA sequence, different from that of the
nucleus in the “host” cell, the organelle and host cell evolve in tandem
– each influences the evolution of the other.

**Fast or slow?**

Which is better, the direct route or the scenic route? Each has its
advantages, depending on the situation. And that describes evolution. It
can be fast or slow, depending on the situation.

### Timing of Macroevolution {#6.html#x-ck12-VGltaW5nIG9mIE1hY3JvZXZvbHV0aW9u_23-npa}

Is evolution slow and steady? Or does it occur in fits and starts? It
may depend on what else is going on, such as changes in climate and
geologic conditions.

-   When geologic and climatic conditions are stable, evolution may
    occur gradually. This is how Darwin thought evolution occurred. This
    model of the timing of evolution is called **gradualism** .
-   When geologic and climatic conditions are changing, evolution may
    occur more quickly. Thus, long periods of little change may be
    interrupted by bursts of rapid change. This model of the timing of
    evolution is called **punctuated equilibrium** . It is better
    supported by the fossil record than is gradualism. This model
    suggests that niches left open by sudden geologic and climatic
    changes may be rapidly filled by bursts of evolution.

Two theories of evolutionary change - gradualism vs. punctuated
equilibrium - are still debated. The former proposes continuous change,
while the latter suggests that species remain constant for long periods
of time and that change, when it occurs, is rapid.

**What are these? Are these organisms plants, fungi, protists, or
animals?**

This colony of tube sponges resembles the pipes of a musical instrument.
These sponges are actually animals, although they are the simplest
animals on Earth. Sponges are frequently used as shelter for small
crabs, shrimps, and other invertebrates.

### Major Trends in Animal Evolution {#6.html#x-ck12-TWFqb3IgVHJlbmRzIGluIEFuaW1hbCBFdm9sdXRpb24._24-lcp}

The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old. By 500
million years ago, most modern phyla of animals had evolved. **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTA2LWdlb2xvZ2ljLXRpbWUtc2NhbGU.) shows
when some of the major events in animal evolution took place.

#### Animal Origins {#6.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsIE9yaWdpbnM._24-x2z}

Who were the ancestors of the earliest animals? They may have been
marine protists that lived in colonies. Scientists think that cells of
some protist colonies became specialized for different jobs. After a
while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival. Thus,
the first multicellular animal evolved. Look at the cells in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMjYwMS0wNg..) . One type of sponge cell,
the **choanocyte** , looks a lot like the protist cell. How does this
support the hypothesis that animals evolved from protists?

#### Evolution of Invertebrates {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEludmVydGVicmF0ZXM._24-g3a}

Many important animal adaptations evolved in invertebrates. Without
these adaptations, vertebrates would not have been able to evolve. They
include:

-   Tissues, organs, and organ systems.
-   A symmetrical body.
-   A brain and sensory organs.
-   A fluid-filled body cavity.
-   A complete digestive system.
-   A body divided into segments.

#### Moving from Water to Land {#6.html#x-ck12-TW92aW5nIGZyb20gV2F0ZXIgdG8gTGFuZA.._24-cnx}

When you think of the first animals to colonize the land, you may think
of amphibians. It’s true that ancestors of amphibians were the first
vertebrates to move to land. However, the very first animals to go
ashore were invertebrates, most likely arthropods.

The move to land required new adaptations. For example, animals needed a
way to keep their body from drying out. They also needed a way to
support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water. One way
early arthropods solved these problems was by evolving an
**exoskeleton.** This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside
of the body. It supports the body and helps retain water. The ability to
breath oxygen without gills was another necessary adaptation. The video
"Walking with Monsters" is a depiction of the evolution of life from
water onto land:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gytrNU3iwvM](watch?v=gytrNU3iwvM)
(4:43).

#### Evolution of Chordates {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIENob3JkYXRlcw.._24-awa}

Another major step in animal evolution was the evolution of a notochord.
A **notochord** is a rigid rod that runs the length of the body. It
supports the body and gives it shape (see **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTA4LXR1bmljYXRl) ). It also provides a
place for muscles to anchor, and counterbalances them when they
contract. Animals with a notochord are called chordates. They also have
a hollow nerve cord that runs along the top of the body. Gill slits and
a tail are two other chordate features. Many modern chordates have some
of these structures only as embryos.

</div>

#### Evolution of Vertebrates {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFZlcnRlYnJhdGVz_24-mpe}

Vertebrates evolved from primitive chordates. This occurred about 550
million years ago. The earliest vertebrates may have been jawless fish,
like the **hagfish** in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTA5LWhhZ2Zpc2g.) . Vertebrates evolved a
backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage. They also
evolved a **cranium** , or bony skull, to enclose and protect the brain.

</div>

As early vertebrates evolved, they became more complex. Around 365
million years ago, they finally made the transition from water to land.
The first vertebrates to live on land were amphibians. They evolved from
lobe-finned fish. You can compare a lobe-finned fish and an amphibian in

periods of time. It could also use its fins to walk on land for short
distances. What similarities do you see between the lobe-finned fish and
the amphibian?

</div>

#### Evolution of Amniotes {#6.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEFtbmlvdGVz_24-9rc}

Amphibians were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life
on land. However, they still had to return to water to reproduce. That’s
because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on
land. The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes.
**Amniotes** are animals that produce eggs with internal membranes. The
membranes let gases but not water pass through. Therefore, in an
amniotic egg, an embryo can breathe without drying out. Amniotic eggs
were the first eggs that could be laid on land.

The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. They may have
looked like the animal in **Figure**
[below](#6.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTExLWVhcmx5LWFtbmlvdGU.) . Within a few
million years, two important amniote groups evolved: synapsids and
sauropsids. **Synapsids** evolved into mammals. The **sauropsids** gave
rise to reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds.

## Summary {#6.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-tev}

Evolution focuses on past life forms and how they turned into present
life forms. The history of life on Earth demonstrates how the first
cells formed, turned into simple life forms, and then became more
complex plants and animals. The studies of Charles Darwin have reshaped
and influenced all aspects of biology. The myriad evidence of evolution
demonstrates the importance of the theory of evolution by natural
selection. Lastly, the current focus on evolution demonstrates that
evolution is a continuous and ongoing process that continues today.

**What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources,
biomes and their populations, and all the species and their
relationships?**

You get ecology. Understanding ecology is in part understanding the
biology of our planet. And it can easily be argued that this is
especially important today. We literally hold the future of our planet
in our hands. The lessons in the *Ecology* chapter discuss ecology and
all the related aspects that comprise the ecosystem.

**What lives in the forest?**

Take a close look at this ecosystem. Obviously there are deer and many
types of plants. But there are organisms that live there that cannot be
seen in the picture. Many other animals, such as rabbits, mice, and
countless insects. There are also bacteria and fungi. Add in the
nonliving aspects of the area, such as the water, and you have an
ecosystem.

### The Ecosystem {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVjb3N5c3RlbQ..-anh}

**Ecology** is the study of how living things interact with each other
and with their environment. It is a major branch of biology, but has
areas of overlap with geography, geology, climatology, and other
sciences. The study of ecology begins with two fundamental concepts in
ecology: the ecosystem and their organisms.

**Organisms** are individual living things. Despite their tremendous
diversity, all organisms have the same basic needs: energy and matter.
These must be obtained from the environment. Therefore, organisms are
not closed systems. They depend on and are influenced by their
environment. The environment includes two types of factors: abiotic and
biotic.

1.  **Abiotic factors** are the nonliving aspects of the environment.
    They include factors such as sunlight, soil, temperature, and water.
2.  **Biotic factors** are the living aspects of the environment. They
    consist of other organisms, including members of the same and
    different species.

An **ecosystem** is a unit of nature and the focus of study in ecology.
It consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their
interactions. Ecosystems can vary in size. A lake could be considered an
ecosystem. So could a dead log on a forest floor. Both the lake and log
contain a variety of species that interact with each other and with
abiotic factors. Another example of an ecosystem is pictured in
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTAxLWRlc2VydC1lY29zeXN0ZW0.)
.

ecosystem](ck12_7_files/20150914104620113957.jpeg "An example of a desert ecosystem")

**Figure 7.1**

A desert ecosystem. What are some of the biotic and abiotic factors in
this desert ecosystem?

</div>

When it comes to energy, ecosystems are not closed. They need constant
inputs of energy. Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight. A small
minority get energy from chemical compounds. Unlike energy, matter is
not constantly added to ecosystems. Instead, it is recycled. Water and
elements such as carbon and nitrogen are used over and over again.

#### Niche {#7.html#x-ck12-TmljaGU.-yvr}

One of the most important concepts associated with the ecosystem is the
niche. A **niche** refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. It
includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and
abiotic factors of the environment. Two important aspects of a species’
niche are the food it eats and how the food is obtained. Look at
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTAyLWJpcmQtbmljaGVz) . It
shows pictures of birds that occupy different niches. Each species eats
a different type of food and obtains the food in a different way.

**Figure 7.2**

Bird Niches. Each of these species of birds has a beak that suits it for
its niche. For example, the long slender beak of the nectarivore allows
it to sip liquid nectar from flowers. The short sturdy beak of the
granivore allows it to crush hard, tough grains.

</div>

#### Habitat {#7.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdA..-hxi}

Another aspect of a species’ niche is its habitat. The **habitat** is
the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is
adapted. A habitat’s features are determined mainly by abiotic factors
such as temperature and rainfall. These factors also influence the
traits of the organisms that live there.

#### Competitive Exclusion Principle {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGV0aXRpdmUgRXhjbHVzaW9uIFByaW5jaXBsZQ..-myl}

A given habitat may contain many different species, but each species
must have a different niche. Two different species cannot occupy the
same niche in the same place for very long. This is known as the
**competitive exclusion principle** . If two species were to occupy the
same niche, what do you think would happen? They would compete with one
another for the same food and other resources in the environment.
Eventually, one species would be likely to outcompete and replace the
other.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-so2}

**What is happening inside each leaf and blade of grass?**

Photosynthesis. Maybe the most important biochemical reaction of Earth.
As sunlight shines down on this forest, the sunlight is being absorbed,
and the energy from that sunlight is being transformed into chemical
energy. That chemical energy is then distributed to all other living
organisms in the ecosystem.

### Flow of Energy {#7.html#x-ck12-RmxvdyBvZiBFbmVyZ3k._1-hbl}

To survive, ecosystems need a constant influx of energy. Energy enters
ecosystems in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Some organisms
use this energy to make food. Other organisms get energy by eating the
food.

#### Producers {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJvZHVjZXJz_1-g6a}

**Producers** are organisms that produce food for themselves and other
organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make
organic compounds. The stability of producers is vital to ecosystems
because all organisms need organic molecules. Producers are also called
**autotrophs** . There are two basic types of autotrophs:
photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs.

1.  **Photoautotrophs** use energy from sunlight to make food
    by photosynthesis. They include plants, algae, and certain bacteria
    (see **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTAzLXBob3RvYXV0b3Ryb3Bocw..) ).
2.  **Chemoautotrophs** use energy from chemical compounds to make food
    by chemosynthesis. They include some bacteria and also archaea.
    Archaea are microorganisms that resemble bacteria.

**Figure 7.3**

Different types of photoautotrophs are important in different
ecosystems.

</div>

#### Consumers {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29uc3VtZXJz_1-eoy}

Consumers are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. They
take in organic molecules by essentially “eating” other living things.
They include all animals and fungi. (Fungi don't really “eat”; they
absorb nutrients from other organisms.) They also include many bacteria
and even a few plants, such as the pitcher plant shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTA0LXBpdGNoZXItcGxhbnQ.) . Consumers are
also called heterotrophs. Heterotrophs are classified by what they eat:

-   **Herbivores** consume producers such as plants or algae. They are a
    necessary link between producers and other consumers. Examples
    include deer, rabbits, and mice.
-   **Carnivores** consume animals. Examples include lions, polar bears,
    hawks, frogs, salmon, and spiders. Carnivores that are unable to
    digest plants and must eat only animals are called
    obligate carnivores. Other carnivores can digest plants but do not
    commonly eat them.
-   **Omnivores** consume both plants and animals. They include humans,
    pigs, brown bears, gulls, crows, and some species of fish.

Pitcher Plant. Virtually all plants are producers. This pitcher plant is
an exception. It consumes insects. It traps them in a sticky substance

and release nutrients. Which type of consumer is a pitcher plant?

</div>

#### Decomposers {#7.html#x-ck12-RGVjb21wb3NlcnM._1-gt0}

When organisms die, they leave behind energy and matter in their
remains. **Decomposers** break down the remains and other wastes and
release simple inorganic molecules back to the environment. Producers
can then use the molecules to make new organic compounds. The stability
of decomposers is essential to every ecosystem. Decomposers are
classified by the type of organic matter they break down:

-   **Scavengers** consume the soft tissues of dead animals. Examples of
    scavengers include vultures, raccoons, and blowflies.
-   **Detritivores** consume **detritus** —the dead leaves, animal
    feces, and other organic debris that collects on the soil or at the
    bottom of a body of water. On land, detritivores include earthworms,
    millipedes, and dung beetles (see **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTA1LWR1bmctYmVldGxl) ). In water,
    detritivores include “bottom feeders” such as sea cucumbers
    and catfish.
-   **Saprotrophs** are the final step in decomposition. They feed on
    any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do
    their work. Saprotrophs include fungi and single-celled protozoa.
    Fungi are the only organisms that can decompose wood.

One of the most beloved and iconic native species within the old growth
redwood forests of California is the Pacific Banana Slug. These slimy
friends of the forest are the ultimate recyclers. Feeding on fallen
leaves, mushrooms or even dead animals, they play a pivotal role in

**Who eats whom?**

Describing the flow of energy within an ecosystem essentially answers
this question. To survive, one must eat. Why? To get energy. Food chains
and webs describe the transfer of energy within an ecosystem, from one
organism to another. In other words, they show who eats whom.

### Food Chains and Food Webs {#7.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBDaGFpbnMgYW5kIEZvb2QgV2Vicw.._2-t1l}

Food chains and food webs are diagrams that represent feeding
relationships. Essentially, they show who eats whom. In this way, they
model how energy and matter move through ecosystems.

#### Food Chains {#7.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBDaGFpbnM._2-7jh}

A **food chain** represents a single pathway by which energy and matter
flow through an ecosystem. An example is shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTA2LUZvb2QtY2hhaW4.) . Food chains are
generally simpler than what really happens in nature. Most organisms
consume—and are consumed by—more than one species.

**Why are pyramids important in ecology?**

The classic example of a pyramid is shown here. But the pyramid
structure can also represent the decrease in a measured substance from
the lowest level on up. In ecology, pyramids model the use of energy
from the producers through the ecosystem.

### Trophic Levels {#7.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGhpYyBMZXZlbHM._3-x1b}

The feeding positions in a food chain or web are called **trophic
levels** . The different trophic levels are defined in the **Table**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dHJvcGhpYy1sZXZlbHM.) . Examples are also
given in the table. All food chains and webs have at least two or three
trophic levels. Generally, there are a maximum of four trophic levels.

  **Trophic Level**                       **Where It Gets Food**         **Example**
  --------------------------------------- ------------------------------ ----------------------
  1st Trophic Level: Producer             Makes its own food             Plants make food
  2nd Trophic Level: Primary Consumer     Consumes producers             Mice eat plant seeds
  3rd Trophic Level: Secondary Consumer   Consumes primary consumers     Snakes eat mice
  4th Trophic Level: Tertiary Consumer    Consumes secondary consumers   Hawks eat snakes

Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Humans, for example,
are primary consumers when they eat plants such as vegetables. They are
secondary consumers when they eat cows. They are tertiary consumers when
they eat salmon.

#### Trophic Levels and Energy {#7.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGhpYyBMZXZlbHMgYW5kIEVuZXJneQ.._3-lbq}

Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic
levels. However, generally only about 10 percent of the energy at one
level is available to the next level. This is represented by the
**ecological pyramid** in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTA4LUVjb2wtUHlyYW1pZA..) . What happens
to the other 90 percent of energy? It is used for metabolic processes or
given off to the environment as heat. This loss of energy explains why
there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web.
Sometimes there may be a fifth trophic level, but usually there’s not
enough energy left to support any additional levels.

**Ecological Pyramid.** This pyramid shows how energy and biomass
decrease from lower to higher trophic levels. Assume that producers in
this pyramid have 1,000,000 kilocalories of energy. How much energy is
available to primary consumers?

</div>

Ecological pyramids can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass or
numbers within an ecosystem. Energy pyramids are discussed at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2nEMzk6\_E](watch?v=8T2nEMzk6_E)
(1:44).

#### Trophic Levels and Biomass {#7.html#x-ck12-VHJvcGhpYyBMZXZlbHMgYW5kIEJpb21hc3M._3-z6g}

With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer
organisms as well. Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic
levels, but their smaller numbers result in less biomass. **Biomass** is
the total mass of organisms at a trophic level. The decrease in biomass
from lower to higher levels is also represented by **Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTA4LUVjb2wtUHlyYW1pZA..) .

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-vxm}

-   The different feeding positions in a food chain or web are called
    trophic levels.
-   Generally, there are no more than four trophic levels because energy
    and biomass decrease from lower to higher levels.

**Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells?**

Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem.
Instead, matter, including water, is recycled. This recycling involves
specific interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors in an
ecosystem. Chances are, the water you drank this morning has been around
for millions of years, or more.

### The Water Cycle {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFdhdGVyIEN5Y2xl_4-dvz}

The chemical elements and water that are needed by organisms
continuously recycle in ecosystems. They pass through biotic and abiotic
components of the biosphere. That’s why their cycles are called
**biogeochemical cycles** . For example, a chemical might move from
organisms ( *bio* ) to the atmosphere or ocean ( *geo* ) and back to
organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of
time in different parts of a cycle.

-   Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a short period of
    time is called an **exchange pool** . For example, the atmosphere is
    an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (in the form of
    water vapor) for just a few days.
-   Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a long period of
    time is called a **reservoir** . The ocean is a reservoir for water.
    The deep ocean may hold water for thousands of years.

Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water
molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The **water cycle** is a
global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earth’s surface, as
shown in **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTA5LXdhdGVyLWN5Y2xl)
.

**Figure 7.10**

Like other biogeochemical cycles, there is no beginning or end to the
water cycle. It just keeps repeating.

</div>

During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas
(water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are
involved as water changes state in the water cycle.

See *Watercourses* at
[http://www.hippocampus.org/HippoCampus/Earth%20Science?loadLeftClass=Course&loadLeftId=153&loadTopicId=10689](Earth%20Science?loadLeftClass=Course&loadLeftId=153&loadTopicId=10689)

#### Evaporation, Sublimation, and Transpiration {#7.html#x-ck12-RXZhcG9yYXRpb24sIFN1YmxpbWF0aW9uLCBhbmQgVHJhbnNwaXJhdGlvbg.._4-wmo}

Water changes to a gas by three different processes:

1.  **Evaporation** occurs when water on the surface changes to
    water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules
    enough energy to escape into the atmosphere.
2.  **Sublimation** occurs when ice and snow change directly to
    water vapor. This also happens because of heat from the sun.
3.  **Transpiration** occurs when plants release water vapor through
    leaf pores called stomata (see **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTEwLUxlYWYtYW5kLVN0b21hdGE.) ).

Plant leaves have many tiny stomata. They release water vapor into the
air.

</div>

#### Condensation and Precipitation {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29uZGVuc2F0aW9uIGFuZCBQcmVjaXBpdGF0aW9u_4-ylv}

Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water
vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. **Condensation**
is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid
water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big
enough, they fall as **precipitation** —rain, snow, sleet, hail, or
freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this
water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen
precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice
can store frozen water for hundreds of years or longer.

#### Groundwater and Runoff {#7.html#x-ck12-R3JvdW5kd2F0ZXIgYW5kIFJ1bm9mZg.._4-cuk}

Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the
ground. This water is called **runoff** . It may eventually flow into a
body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land may soak into the
ground, becoming **groundwater** . Groundwater may seep out of the
ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some
groundwater may be taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper
underground to an **aquifer** . This is an underground layer of rock
that stores water, sometimes for thousands of years.

project to understand how global warming is affecting our fresh water
supply. And they're doing it by tracking individual raindrops in
Mendocino and north of Lake Tahoe. See

**How could releasing this much pollution into the atmosphere not be a
poor idea?**

Burning of fossil fuels, such as oil, releases carbon into the
atmosphere. This carbon must be cycled - removed from the atmosphere -
back into living organisms, or it stays in the atmosphere. Increased
carbon in the atmosphere contributes to the greenhouse effect on Earth.

### The Carbon Cycle {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENhcmJvbiBDeWNsZQ.._5-bru}

Flowing water can slowly dissolve carbon in sedimentary rock. Most of
this carbon ends up in the ocean. The deep ocean can store carbon for
thousands of years or more. Sedimentary rock and the ocean are major
reservoirs of stored carbon. Carbon is also stored for varying lengths
of time in the atmosphere, in living organisms, and as fossil fuel
deposits. These are all parts of the **carbon cycle** , which is shown
in **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTExLWNhcmJvbi1jeWNsZQ..) .

The Carbon Cycle. Carbon moves from one reservoir to another in the
carbon cycle. What role do organisms play in this cycle?

</div>

The carbon cycle is discussed in the following video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vwa6qtEih8](watch?v=0Vwa6qtEih8)
(1:56).

Why is recycling carbon important? Recall that carbon is the cornerstone
of organic compounds, the compounds necessary for life. But do organisms
make their own carbon? Do they have the genes that encode proteins
necessary to make carbon? No. In fact, there are no such genes. Carbon
must be recycled from other living organisms, from carbon in the
atmosphere, and from carbon in other parts of the biosphere.

#### Carbon in the Atmosphere {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uIGluIHRoZSBBdG1vc3BoZXJl_5-cgb}

Though carbon can be found in ocean water, rocks and sediment and other
parts of the biosphere, the atmosphere may be the most recognizable
reservoir of carbon. Carbon occurs in various forms in different parts
of the carbon cycle. Some of the different forms in which carbon appears
are described in **Table**

#### Carbon in Carbon Dioxide {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2FyYm9uIGluIENhcmJvbiBEaW94aWRl_5-9l4}

Carbon cycles quickly between organisms and the atmosphere. In the
atmosphere, carbon exists primarily as carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ). Carbon
dioxide cycles through the atmosphere by several different processes,
including those listed below.

-   Living organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of **cellular
    respiration** .
-   **Photosynthesis** removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
    uses it to make organic compounds.
-   Carbon dioxide is given off when dead organisms and other organic
    materials decompose.
-   Burning organic material, such as fossil fuels, releases
    carbon dioxide.
-   Carbon cycles far more slowly through geological processes such as
    **sedimentation** . Carbon may be stored in sedimentary rock for
    millions of years.
-   When volcanoes erupt, they give off carbon dioxide that is stored in
    the mantle.
-   Carbon dioxide is released when limestone is heated during the
    production of cement.
-   Ocean water releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
    when water temperature rises.
-   Carbon dioxide is also removed when ocean water cools and dissolves
    more carbon dioxide from the air.

Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years.
Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also
increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities
reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in
photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which
releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.

**Alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupins, mesquite, carob, soy,
and peanuts. What are these?**

Legumes. Legume plants have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, due
to a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with bacteria found in root
nodules of these plants.

### The Nitrogen Cycle {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE5pdHJvZ2VuIEN5Y2xl_6-vzb}

Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth’s atmosphere. It’s also an
important part of living things. Nitrogen is found in proteins, nucleic
acids, and chlorophyll. The **nitrogen cycle** moves nitrogen through
the abiotic and biotic parts of ecosystems. **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTEyLU5pdHJvZ2VuLWN5Y2xl) shows how
nitrogen cycles through a terrestrial ecosystem. Nitrogen passes through
a similar cycle in aquatic ecosystems.

Nitrogen Cycle in a Terrestrial Ecosystem. Nitrogen cycles between the
atmosphere and living things.

</div>

Even though nitrogen gas makes up most of Earth's atmosphere, plants
cannot use this nitrogen gas to make organic compounds for themselves
and other organisms. The two nitrogen atoms in a molecule of nitrogen
gas are held together by a very stable triple bond. This bond must be
broken for the nitrogen to be used. The nitrogen gas must be changed to
a form called nitrates, which plants can absorb through their roots. The
process of changing nitrogen gas to nitrates is called **nitrogen
fixation** . It is carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria
live in soil and roots of legumes, such as peas.

When plants and other organisms die, decomposers break down their
remains. In the process, they release nitrogen in the form of ammonium
ions. This process is called **ammonification.** Nitrifying bacteria
change the ammonium ions into nitrites and nitrates. Some of the
nitrates are used by plants. The process of converting ammonium ions to
nitrites or nitrates is called **nitrification.** Still other bacteria,
called denitrifying bacteria, convert some of the nitrates in soil back
into nitrogen gas in a process called **denitrification.** The process
is the opposite of nitrogen fixation. Denitrification returns nitrogen
gas back to the atmosphere, where it can continue the nitrogen cycle.

See *The Nitrogen Cycle: An Aquatic Perspective* at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdY4I-EaqJA](watch?v=pdY4I-EaqJA) (5:08)
for a summary of this cycle. The cycle is also summarized at

(2:04).

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-ot5}

-   The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen back and forth between the
    atmosphere and organisms.
-   Bacteria change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to nitrogen
    compounds that plants can absorb.

**What do temperature, wind and rain have in common?**

They are all part of climate, the statistical summary of temperature,
humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, other meteorological
measurements in a given region over long periods. In other words, is it
dry or wet, hot or cold, or humid? And it is these abiotic factors that
help determine the nature of a biome.

### Terrestrial Biomes {#7.html#x-ck12-VGVycmVzdHJpYWwgQmlvbWVz_7-0e9}

If you look at the two pictures in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTEzLWRlc2VydC1yYWluZm9yZXN0LWNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..)
, you will see very few similarities. The picture on the left shows a
desert in Africa. The picture on the right shows a rainforest in
Australia. The desert doesn’t have any visible plants, whereas the
rainforest is densely packed with trees. What explains these
differences?

**Terrestrial biomes** include all the land areas on Earth where
organisms live. The distinguishing features of terrestrial biomes are
determined mainly by climate. Terrestrial biomes include tundras,
temperate forests and grasslands, chaparral, temperate and tropical
deserts, and tropical forests and grasslands.

#### Terrestrial Biomes and Climate {#7.html#x-ck12-VGVycmVzdHJpYWwgQmlvbWVz_7IGFuZCBDbGltYXRl-b9w}

**Climate** is the average weather in an area over a long period of
time. **Weather** refers to the conditions of the atmosphere from day to
day. Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and
moisture.

Temperature falls from the equator to the poles. Therefore, major
temperature zones are based on **latitude** . They include tropical,
temperate, and arctic zones (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTE0LXRlbXBlcmF0dXJlLXpvbmVz) ). However,
other factors besides latitude may also influence temperature. For
example, land near the ocean may have cooler summers and warmer winters
than land farther inland. This is because water gains and loses heat
more slowly than does land, and the water temperature influences the
temperature on the coast. Temperature also falls from lower to higher
altitudes. That’s why tropical zone mountain tops may be capped with
snow.

live in?

</div>

In terms of moisture, climates can be classified as arid (dry),
semi-arid, humid (wet), or semi-humid. The amount of moisture depends on
both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation increases moisture.
Evaporation decreases moisture.

-   The global pattern of precipitation is influenced by movements of
    air masses. For example, there is a global belt of dry air masses
    and low precipitation at about 30° N and 30° S latitude.
-   Precipitation is also influenced by temperature. Warm air can hold
    more moisture than cold air, so tropical areas receive more rainfall
    than other parts of the world.
-   Nearness to the ocean and mountain ranges may also influence the
    amount of precipitation an area receives. This is explained in
    **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTE1LXByZWNpcC1vY2Vhbi1tb3VudGFpbnM.) .
-   Evaporation of moisture is greatest where it is hot and sunny.
    Therefore, cold climates with low precipitation may not be as dry as
    warm climates with the same amount of precipitation.
-   Moist air from the ocean rises up over the mountain range.
-   As the air rises, it cools and its water vapor condenses.
    Precipitation falls on the windward side of the mountain range.
-   The air is dry when it reaches the leeward side of the mountain
    range, so there is little precipitation there. This creates a “rain
    shadow.”

#### Climate and Plant Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZSBhbmQgUGxhbnQgR3Jvd3Ro_7-hse}

Plants are the major producers in terrestrial biomes. They have five
basic needs: air, warmth, sunlight, water, and nutrients. How well these
needs are met in a given location depends on the growing season and soil
quality, both of which are determined mainly by climate.

-   The **growing season** is the period of time each year when it is
    warm and wet enough for plants to grow. The growing season may last
    all year in a hot, wet climate but just a few months in a cooler or
    drier climate.
-   Plants grow best in soil that contains plenty of nutrients and
    organic matter. Both are added to soil when plant litter and dead
    organisms decompose. Decomposition occurs too slowly in cold
    climates and too quickly in hot, wet climates for nutrients and
    organic matter to accumulate. Temperate climates usually have the
    best soil for plant growth.

#### Climate and Biodiversity {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZSBhbmQgQmlvZGl2ZXJzaXR5_7-eit}

Because climate determines plant growth, it also influences the number
and variety of other organisms in a terrestrial biome. **Biodiversity**
generally increases from the poles to the equator. It is also usually
greater in more humid climates. This is apparent from the desert and
rainforest biomes pictured in **Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTEzLWRlc2VydC1yYWluZm9yZXN0LWNvbXBvc2l0ZQ..)
.

#### Climate and Adaptations {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF0ZSBhbmQgQWRhcHRhdGlvbnM._7-kcy}

Organisms evolve adaptations that help them survive in the climate of
the biome where they live. For example, in biomes with arid climates,
plants may have special tissues for storing water (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTE2LWFsb2UtYmFycmVsLWNhY3R1cw..) ). The
desert animals pictured in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTE3LURlc2VydC1hbmltYWxz) also have
adaptations for a dry climate.

</div>

In biomes with cold climates, plants may adapt by becoming dormant
during the coldest part of the year. **Dormancy** is a state in which a
plant slows down cellular activities and may shed its leaves. Animals
also adapt to cold temperatures. One way is with insulation in the form
of fur and fat. This is how the polar bears in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTE4LXBvbGFyLWJlYXJz) stay warm.

temperature. Instead, they have about the same temperature as their
surroundings.)

**Do aquatic ecosystems need sunlight?**

Of course. The sunlight - in part - allows the diversity of life seen in
this ecosystem. If the available sunlight was less, could this ecosystem
still thrive? Maybe, but the ecosystem would probably be very different.
Sunlight, of course, is necessary for photosynthesis, which brings
energy into an ecosystem. So, the availability of that sunlight has a
direct impact on the productivity and biodiversity of aquatic
ecosystems.

### Aquatic Biomes {#7.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBCaW9tZXM._9-qz5}

Terrestrial organisms are generally limited by temperature and moisture.
Therefore, terrestrial biomes are defined in terms of these abiotic
factors. Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of
temperature or moisture. Instead, their main limiting factors are the
availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and
nutrients in the water. These factors vary from place to place in a body
of water and are used to define **aquatic biomes** .

#### Aquatic Biomes and Sunlight {#7.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBCaW9tZXMgYW5kIFN1bmxpZ2h0_9-k6u}

In large bodies of standing water, including the ocean and lakes, the
water can be divided into zones based on the amount of sunlight it
receives:

1.  The **photic zone** extends to a maximum depth of 200 meters
    (656 feet) below the surface of the water. This is where enough
    sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. Algae and other
    photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs.
2.  The **aphotic zone** is water deeper than 200 meters. This is where
    too little sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. As a
    result, food must be made by chemosynthesis or else drift down from
    the water above.

These and other aquatic zones in the ocean are identified in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTIxLWFxdWF0aWMtem9uZXM.) .

<div id="7.html#x-ck12-MWE5ZGE2ODk2YTQ2YTFjOWJjNzk4ZTkxOTg5ZGMwY2I.-g7r"

**Figure 7.21**

The ocean is divided into many different zones, depending on distance
from shore and depth of water.

</div>

#### Aquatic Biomes and Dissolved Substances {#7.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBCaW9tZXMgYW5kIERpc3NvbHZlZCBTdWJzdGFuY2Vz_9-4vr}

Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved
oxygen and nutrients it contains:

1.  Water near the surface of lakes and the ocean usually has more
    dissolved oxygen than does deeper water. This is because surface
    water absorbs oxygen from the air above it.
2.  Water near shore generally has more dissolved nutrients than water
    farther from shore. This is because most nutrients enter the water
    from land. They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that
    empty into a body of water.
3.  Water near the bottom of lakes and the ocean may contain more
    nutrients than water closer to the surface. When aquatic organisms
    die, they sink to the bottom. Decomposers near the bottom of the
    water break down the dead organisms and release their nutrients back
    into the water.

#### Marine Biomes {#7.html#x-ck12-TWFyaW5lIEJpb21lcw.._9-dg8}

Anglerfish live in the ocean. Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called
**marine biomes** . Organisms that live in marine biomes must be adapted
to the salt in the water. For example, many have organs for excreting
excess salt. Two ocean zones are particularly challenging to marine
organisms: the intertidal zone and the deep ocean.

The **intertidal zone** is the narrow strip along the coastline that is
covered by water at high tide and exposed to air at low tide (see
**Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTIzLUxvdy10aWRlLXdpdGgtdGV4dA..) ).
There are plenty of nutrients and sunlight in the intertidal zone.
However, the water is constantly moving in and out, and the temperature
keeps changing. These conditions require adaptations in the organisms
that live there, such as the barnacles in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTI0LWJhcm5hY2xlcw..) .

Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand extreme
water pressure, very cold water, and complete darkness. However, even
here, thriving communities of living things can be found. Organisms
cluster around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. The vents release
hot water containing chemicals that would be toxic to most other living
things. The producers among them are single-celled chemoautotrophs. They
make food using energy stored in the chemicals.

#### Monitoring Marine Protected Areas {#7.html#x-ck12-TW9uaXRvcmluZyBNYXJpbmUgUHJvdGVjdGVkIEFyZWFz_9-hux}

Is overfishing an important issue? What would happen if fish populations
dwindled? Marine Protected Areas are no-fishing zones that have recently
been established up and down the California coast, in the hope of
allowing fish to breed, grow large, and replenish state waters.
Scientists monitor these areas to determine if this process is working.

**What may be the most biologically diverse type of ecosystem?**

These are wetland marshes in Delaware. Notice the abundance of
vegetation mixed with the water. And of course, where there are plants,
there are animals. Wetlands are considered the most biologically diverse
of all ecosystems. Plant life found in wetlands includes mangrove, water
lilies, cattails, black spruce, cypress, and many others. Animal life
includes many different amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects, and
mammals.

### Freshwater Biomes {#7.html#x-ck12-RnJlc2h3YXRlciBCaW9tZXM._10-t7m}

**Freshwater biomes** have water that contains little or no salt. They
include standing and running freshwater biomes. Standing freshwater
biomes include ponds and lakes. Lakes are generally bigger and deeper
than ponds. Some of the water in lakes is in the aphotic zone, where
there is too little sunlight for photosynthesis. Plankton and plants,
such as the duckweed in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTI1LUZyZXNod2F0ZXItcHJvZHVjZXJzLXdpdGgtdGV4dA..)
, are the primary producers in standing freshwater biomes.

**Figure 7.24**

The pond on the left has a thick mat of duckweed plants. They cover the
surface of the water and use sunlight for photosynthesis. The cattails
on the right grow along a stream bed. They have tough, slender leaves
that can withstand moving water.

</div>

Running freshwater biomes include streams and rivers. Rivers are usually
larger than streams. Streams may start with runoff or water seeping out
of a spring. The water runs downhill and joins other running water to
become a stream. A stream may flow into a river that empties into a lake
or the ocean. Running water is better able to dissolve oxygen and
nutrients than standing water. However, the moving water is a challenge
to many living things. Algae and plants, such as the cattails in
**Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTI1LUZyZXNod2F0ZXItcHJvZHVjZXJzLXdpdGgtdGV4dA..)
, are the primary producers in running water biomes.

#### Wetlands {#7.html#x-ck12-V2V0bGFuZHM._10-myc}

A **wetland** is an area that is saturated with water or covered by
water for at least one season of the year. The water may be freshwater
or salt water. Wetlands are extremely important biomes for several
reasons:

-   They store excess water from floods.
-   They slow down runoff and help prevent erosion.
-   They remove excess nutrients from runoff before it empties into
    rivers or lakes.
-   They provide a unique habitat that certain communities of plants
    need to survive.
-   They provide a safe, lush habitat for many species of animals, so
    they have high biodiversity.

#### KQED: Restoring Wetlands {#7.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogUmVzdG9yaW5nIFdldGxhbmRz_10-xcz}

More than 100,000 acres of wetlands are being restored in the Northern
California Bay Area, but how exactly do we know what to restore them to?
Historical ecologists are recreating San Francisco Bay wetlands that
existed decades ago. To learn more, see
[http://science.kqed.org/quest/video/wetlands-time-machine/]() .

For more than 100 years, south San Francisco Bay has been a center for
industrial salt production. Now federal and state biologists are working
to restore the ponds to healthy wetlands for fish and other wildlife.
Salt marshes are rich habitats that provide shelter and food for many
species, some of which are endangered or threatened. See

#### KQED: San Francisco Bay: A Unique Estuary {#7.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogU2FuIEZyYW5jaXNjbyBCYXk6IEEgVW5pcXVlIEVzdHVhcnk._10-dxp}

An **estuary** is a partly enclosed coastal body of water with one or
more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to
the ocean. Estuaries can be thought of as the most biologically
productive regions on Earth, with very high biodiversity. Estuaries are
zones where land and sea come together, and where fresh and salt water
meet.

The San Francisco Bay is one of the great estuaries of the world. See

**What is this? Plant or animal?**

It is actually the Yellow Christmas tree worm. These animals are
colorful, and can be red, orange, yellow, blue, and white. The Christmas
tree worm lives on tropical coral reefs throughout the world. The
Christmas tree worm's plumes are used for feeding and respiration. These
worms use their plumes to catch plankton and other small particles
passing in the water. Cilia then pass the food to the worm's mouth.

### Aquatic Organisms {#7.html#x-ck12-QXF1YXRpYyBPcmdhbmlzbXM._11-out}

Aquatic organisms generally fall into three broad groups: plankton,
nekton, and benthos. They vary in how they move and where they live.

1.  **Plankton** are tiny aquatic organisms that cannot move on
    their own. They live in the photic zone. They include phytoplankton
    and zooplankton. **Phytoplankton** are bacteria and algae that use
    sunlight to make food. **Zooplankton** are tiny animals that feed
    on phytoplankton. See *NASA - In The Zone* at
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB1FADETAyg](watch?v=lB1FADETAyg)
    for additional information about phytoplankton.
2.  **Nekton** are aquatic animals that can move on their own by
    “swimming” through the water. They may live in the photic or
    aphotic zone. They feed on plankton or other nekton. Examples of
    nekton include fish and shrimp.
3.  **Benthos** are aquatic organisms that crawl in sediments at the
    bottom of a body of water. Many are decomposers. Benthos include
    sponges, clams, and anglerfish like the one in **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTExLTIyLWFuZ2xlcmZpc2g.) . How has this
    fish adapted to a life in the dark?

worm to attract prey. In the darkness, only the rod-like worm is
visible.

#### KQED: Studying Aquatic Animals {#7.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogU3R1ZHlpbmcgQXF1YXRpYyBBbmltYWxz_11-iyz}

Oceans cover more than 70 percent of our planet, yet they are some of
the least explored regions on Earth. Who better to unlock the mysteries
of the ocean than marine animals themselves? Marine scientists have been
tagging and tracking sharks, leatherback turtles, and other sea life to
learn more about marine ecosystems. Through the Tagging of Pacific
Predators program (TOPP), scientists hope to assess and explain the
migration routes, ecosystems, and diversity of our oceans’ species.

Beginning in 2000, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, Stanford University, and the University of California,
Santa Cruz combined to form TOPP. As part of TOPP, researchers attach
satellite tags to elephant seals, white sharks, giant leatherback
turtles, bluefin tuna, swordfish, and other marine animals. The tags
collect information, such as how deep each animal dives, the levels of
ambient light (to help determine an animal’s location), and interior and
exterior body temperature. Some tags also collect information about the
temperature, salinity, and depth of the water surrounding an animal to
help scientists identify ocean currents. The tags send the data to a
satellite, which in turn sends the data the scientists. They use this
information to create maps of migration patterns and discover new
information about different marine ecosystems. The information collected
by TOPP offers rare insights into the lives of marine animals. Without
TOPP, that information would otherwise remain unknown. With TOPP,
scientists are developing a working knowledge of the particular
migration routes animals take, as well as the locations of popular
breeding grounds and the environmental dangers faced by different
species. TOPP has shed light on how we can better protect the
leatherback turtle and other endangered species.

**What may be the most common way different species interact?**

Biomes as different as deserts and wetlands share something very
important. All biomes have populations of interacting species. Species
interact in the same basic ways in all biomes. For example, all biomes
have some species that prey on others for food.

### Predation {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGF0aW9u_12-rdo}

**Predation** is a relationship in which members of one species (the
**predator** ) consume members of another species (the **prey** ). The
lionesses and zebra in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTAxLXByZWRhdG9ycy1hbmQtcHJleQ..) are
classic examples of predators and prey. In addition to the lionesses,
there is another predator in this figure. Can you spot it? The other
predator is the zebra. Like the lionesses, it consumes prey species, in
this case species of grass. However, unlike the lionesses, the zebra
does not kill its prey. Predator-prey relationships such as these
account for most energy transfers in food chains and food webs.

Predators and Their Prey. These lionesses feed on the carcass of a

</div>

#### Predation and Population {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJlZGF0aW9u_12IGFuZCBQb3B1bGF0aW9u-c36}

A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both
species in balance. This is shown by the graph in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTAyLXBvcHVsYXRpb24tZHluYW1pY3M.) . As
the prey population increases, there is more food for predators. So,
after a slight lag, the predator population increases as well. As the
number of predators increases, more prey are captured. As a result, the
prey population starts to decrease. What happens to the predator
population then?

**Figure 7.27**

Predator-Prey Population Dynamics. As the prey population increases, why
does the predator population also increase?

</div>

In the predator-prey example, one factor limits the growth of the other
factor. As the prey population deceases, the predator population is
begins to decrease as well. The prey population is a limiting factor. A
**limiting factor** limits the growth or development of an organism,
population, or process.

#### Keystone Species {#7.html#x-ck12-S2V5c3RvbmUgU3BlY2llcw.._12-fk7}

Some predator species are known as keystone species. A **keystone
species** is one that plays an especially important role in its
community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the
populations of many other species in the community. For example, some
sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea
stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural
predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel
and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn,
would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community
would be destroyed.

#### Adaptations to Predation {#7.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnMgdG8gUHJlZGF0aW9u_12-szy}

Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve
through natural selection. Predator adaptations help them capture prey.
Prey adaptations help them avoid predators. A common adaptation in both
predator and prey is **camouflage** . Several examples are shown in
**Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTAzLWNhbW91ZmxhZ2U.) .
Camouflage in prey helps them hide from predators. Camouflage in
predators helps them sneak up on prey.

**Does there have to be a winner?**

When animals compete? Yes. Animals, or other organisms, will compete
when both want the same thing. One must "lose" so the winner can have
the resource. But competition doesn't necessarily involve physical
altercations.

### Competition {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGV0aXRpb24._13-wtu}

**Competition** is a relationship between organisms that strive for the
same resources in the same place. The resources might be food, water, or
space. There are two different types of competition:

1.  **Intraspecific competition** occurs between members of the
    same species. For example, two male birds of the same species might
    compete for mates in the same area. This type of competition is a
    basic factor in natural selection. It leads to the evolution of
    better adaptations within a species.
2.  **Interspecific competition** occurs between members of
    different species. For example, predators of different species might
    compete for the same prey.

#### Interspecific Competition and Extinction {#7.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJzcGVjaWZpYyBDb21wZXRpdGlvbiBhbmQgRXh0aW5jdGlvbg.._13-wp1}

Interspecific competition often leads to **extinction** . The species
that is less well adapted may get fewer of the resources that both
species need. As a result, members of that species are less likely to
survive, and the species may go extinct.

#### Interspecific Competition and Specialization {#7.html#x-ck12-SW50ZXJzcGVjaWZpYyBDb21wZXRpdGlvbiBhbmQgU3BlY2lhbGl6YXRpb24._13-djt}

Instead of extinction, interspecific competition may lead to greater
specialization. **Specialization** occurs when competing species evolve
different adaptations. For example, they may evolve adaptations that
allow them to use different food sources. **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTA0LWFub2xlLWxpemFyZHM.) describes an
example.

**Do interactions between species always result in harm?**

A commensal shrimp sits on another sea organism, a sea slug. As a
commensal shrimp, it neither brings a benefit nor has a negative effect
on its host.

### Symbiotic Relationships {#7.html#x-ck12-U3ltYmlvdGljIFJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHM._14-7vd}

**Symbiosis** is a close relationship between two species in which at
least one species benefits. For the other species, the relationship may
be positive, negative, or neutral. There are three basic types of
symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.

#### Mutualism {#7.html#x-ck12-TXV0dWFsaXNt_14-sn4}

**Mutualism** is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit.
An example of mutualism involves goby fish and shrimp (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTA1LXNocmltcC1nb2J5) ). The nearly blind
shrimp and the fish spend most of their time together. The shrimp
maintains a burrow in the sand in which both the fish and shrimp live.
When a predator comes near, the fish touches the shrimp with its tail as
a warning. Then, both fish and shrimp retreat to the burrow until the
predator is gone. From their relationship, the shrimp gets a warning of
approaching danger. The fish gets a safe retreat and a place to lay its
eggs.

**Figure 7.30**

The multicolored shrimp in the front and the green goby fish behind it

</div>

#### Commensalism {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29tbWVuc2FsaXNt_14-sao}

**Commensalism** is a symbiotic relationship in which one species
benefits while the other species is not affected. One species typically
uses the other for a purpose other than food. For example, mites attach
themselves to larger flying insects to get a “free ride.” Hermit crabs
use the shells of dead snails for homes.

#### Parasitism {#7.html#x-ck12-UGFyYXNpdGlzbQ.._14-d8m}

**Parasitism** is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the
**parasite** ) benefits while the other species (the **host** ) is
harmed. Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some
stage of their life. Most species are also hosts to one or more
parasites.

Some parasites live on the surface of their host. Others live inside
their host. They may enter the host through a break in the skin or in
food or water. For example, roundworms are parasites of mammals,
including humans, cats, and dogs (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTA2LXJvdW5kd29ybXM.) ). The worms
produce huge numbers of eggs, which are passed in the host’s feces to
the environment. Other individuals may be infected by swallowing the
eggs in contaminated food or water.

</div>

Some parasites kill their host, but most do not. It’s easy to see why.
If a parasite kills its host, the parasite is also likely to die.
Instead, parasites usually cause relatively minor damage to their host.

**Can a plant really grow in hardened lava?**

It can if it is very hardy and tenacious. And that is how succession
starts. It begins with a plant that must be able to grow on new land
with minimal soil or nutrients.

### Ecological Succession {#7.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9naWNhbCBTdWNjZXNzaW9u_15-rip}

Communities are not usually static. The numbers and types of species
that live in them generally change over time. This is called
**ecological succession** . Important cases of succession are primary
and secondary succession.

#### Primary Succession {#7.html#x-ck12-UHJpbWFyeSBTdWNjZXNzaW9u_15-8cr}

**Primary succession** occurs in an area that has never before been
colonized. Generally, the area is nothing but bare rock. This type of
environment may come about when

-   lava flows from a volcano and hardens into rock.
-   a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock.
-   a landslide uncovers an area of bare rock.

The first species to colonize a disturbed area such as this are called
**pioneer species** (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTA3LXByaW1hcnktc3VjY2Vzc2lvbg..) ). They
change the environment and pave the way for other species to come into
the area. Pioneer species are likely to include bacteria and lichens
that can live on bare rock. Along with wind and water, they help weather
the rock and form soil. Once soil begins to form, plants can move in. At
first, the plants include grasses and other species that can grow in
thin, poor soil. As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to
the soil. This improves the soil and helps it hold water. The improved
soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area.

Primary Succession. New land from a volcanic eruption is slowly being
colonized by a pioneer species.

</div>

#### Secondary Succession {#7.html#x-ck12-U2Vjb25kYXJ5IFN1Y2Nlc3Npb24._15-pxb}

**Secondary succession** occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was
disturbed. The disturbance could be a fire, flood, or human action such
as farming. This type of succession is faster because the soil is
already in place. In this case, the pioneer species are plants such as
grasses, birch trees, and fireweed. Organic matter from the pioneer
species improves the soil. This lets other plants move into the area. An
example of this type of succession is shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTA4LXNlY29uZGFyeS1zdWNjZXNzaW9u) .

#### Climax Communities {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2xpbWF4IENvbW11bml0aWVz_15-igw}

Many early ecologists thought that a community always goes through the
same series of stages during succession. They also assumed that
succession always ends with a final stable stage. They called this stage
the **climax community** . Today, most ecologists no longer hold these
views. They believe that continued change is normal in most ecosystems.
They think that most communities are disturbed too often to become
climax communities.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-guo}

-   Ecological succession is the process in which a community changes
    through time.
-   Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before

**Is this any way to live?**

It is if you're a penguin. This population of penguins is made of all
the individuals of the same species of penguins who live together. They
seem to exist in a very crowded - or densely populated - environment,
and in a random configuration.

### Population Size, Density, and Distribution {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBTaXplLCBEZW5zaXR5LCBhbmQgRGlzdHJpYnV0aW9u_16-9pj}

Communities are made up of populations of different species. In biology,
a **population** is a group of organisms of the same species that live
in the same area. The population is the unit of natural selection and
evolution. How large a population is and how fast it is growing are
often used as measures of its health.

**Population size** is the number of individuals in a population. For
example, a population of insects might consist of 100 individual
insects, or many more. Population size influences the chances of a
species surviving or going extinct. Generally, very small populations
are at greatest risk of extinction. However, the size of a population
may be less important than its density.

#### Population Density {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBEZW5zaXR5_16-ed8}

**Population density** is the average number of individuals in a
population per unit of area or volume. For example, a population of 100
insects that live in an area of 100 square meters has a density of 1
insect per square meter. If the same population lives in an area of only
1 square meter, what is its density? Which population is more crowded?
How might crowding affect the health of a population?

#### Population Distribution {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBEaXN0cmlidXRpb24._16-mda}

Population density just represents the average number of individuals per
unit of area or volume. Often, individuals in a population are not
spread out evenly. Instead, they may live in clumps or some other
pattern (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTA5LXBvcHVsYXRpb24tZGVuc2l0eQ..) ). The
pattern may reflect characteristics of the species or its environment.
**Population distribution** describes how the individuals are
distributed, or spread throughout their habitat.

**Young vs. old. Does it matter?**

When it comes to populations, yes it does. The age structure (and the
sex structure) of a population influences population growth. Can you
explain why?

### Population Structure {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBTdHJ1Y3R1cmU._17-pv5}

**Population growth** is the change in the size of the population over
time. An important factor in population growth is **age-sex structure**
. This is the number of individuals of each sex and age in the
population. The age-sex structure influences population growth. This is
because younger people are more likely to reproduce, while older people
have higher rates of dying.

#### Population Pyramids {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBQeXJhbWlkcw.._17-7gv}

Age-sex structure is represented by a **population pyramid** . This is a
bar graph, like the one **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTEwLXBvcHVsYXRpb24tcHlyYW1pZA..) . In
this example, the bars become narrower from younger to older ages. Can
you explain why?

Survivorship curves reflect death rates at different ages.

</div>

The three types of curves shown in the figure actually represent
different strategies species use to adapt to their environment:

-   Type I: Parents produce relatively few offspring and provide them
    with a lot of care. As a result, most of the offspring survive to
    adulthood so they can reproduce. This pattern is typical of large
    animals, including humans.
-   Type II: Parents produce moderate numbers of offspring and provide
    some parental care. Deaths occur more uniformly throughout life.
    This pattern occurs in some birds and many asexual species.
-   Type III: Parents produce many offspring but provide them with
    little or no care. As a result, relatively few offspring survive
    to adulthood. This pattern is typical of plants, invertebrates, and
    many species of fish.

See [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkAnO8VjCz0](watch?v=xkAnO8VjCz0)
for an overview of survivorship curves.

The Type I strategy occurs more often in stable environments. The Type
III strategy is more likely in unstable environments. Can you explain
why?

**What would old luggage have to do with population growth?**

Moving into an area, or immigration, is a key factor in the growth of
populations. Shown above is actual vintage luggage left by some of the
millions of immigrants who came through Ellis Island and into the United
States.

### Population Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBHcm93dGg._18-vrb}

Populations gain individuals through births and immigration. They lose
individuals through deaths and emigration. These factors together
determine how fast a population grows.

#### Population Growth Rate {#7.html#x-ck12-UG9wdWxhdGlvbiBHcm93dGggUmF0ZQ.._18-gvl}

**Population growth rate** ( *r* ) is how fast a population changes in
size over time. A positive growth rate means a population is increasing.
A negative growth rate means it is decreasing. The two main factors
affecting population growth are the birth rate ( *b* ) and death rate (
*d* ). Population growth may also be affected by people coming into the
population from somewhere else ( **immigration** , *i* ) or leaving the
population for another area ( **emigration** , *e* ). The formula for
population growth takes all these factors into account.

*r* = ( *b* + *i* ) - ( *d* + *e* )

-   *r* = population growth rate
-   *b* = birth rate
-   *i* = immigration rate
-   *d* = death rate
-   *e* = emigration rate

(49:38).

#### Dispersal {#7.html#x-ck12-RGlzcGVyc2Fs_18-qns}

Other types of movements may also affect population size and growth. For
example, many species have some means of **dispersal** . This refers to
offspring moving away from their parents. This prevents the offspring
from competing with the parents for resources such as light or water.
For example, dandelion seeds have “parachutes.” They allow the wind to
carry the seeds far from the parents (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTEyLXNlZWQtZGlzcGVyc2Fs) ).

</div>

#### Migration {#7.html#x-ck12-TWlncmF0aW9u_18-r0g}

Migration is another type of movement that changes population size.
**Migration** is the regular movement of individuals or populations each
year during certain seasons. The purpose of migration usually is to find
food, mates, or other resources. For example, many northern hemisphere
birds migrate thousands of miles south each fall. They go to areas where
the weather is warmer and more resources are available (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTEzLXN3YWluc29ucy1oYXdrcw..) ). Then
they return north in the spring to nest. Some animals, such as elk,
migrate vertically. They go up the sides of mountains in spring as snow
melts. They go back down the mountain sides in fall as snow returns.

**What starts out very small and has the potential to grow considerably
larger?**

Trees, of course. But also populations. Give a population everything it
needs to survive, and the growth of that population will be tremendous.

### Patterns of Population Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-UGF0dGVybnMgb2YgUG9wdWxhdGlvbiBHcm93dGg._19-xur}

Populations may show different patterns of growth. The growth pattern
depends partly on the conditions under which a population lives.

#### Exponential Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-RXhwb25lbnRpYWwgR3Jvd3Ro_19-0zi}

Under ideal conditions, populations of most species can grow at
exponential rates. Curve A in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.)
represents **exponential growth** . The population starts out growing
slowly. As population size increases, the growth rate also increases.
The larger the population becomes, the faster it grows.

**Figure 7.39**

Exponential and Logistic Growth. Curve A shows exponential growth. Curve
B shows logistic growth.

</div>

#### Logistic Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-TG9naXN0aWMgR3Jvd3Ro_19-oro}

Most populations do not live under ideal conditions. Therefore, most do
not grow exponentially. Certainly, no population can keep growing
exponentially for very long. Many factors may limit growth. Often, the
factors are density dependent (known as **density-dependent factors** ).
These are factors that are influential when the population becomes too
large and crowded. For example, the population may start to run out of
food or be poisoned by its own wastes. As a result, population growth
slows and population size levels off. Curve B in **Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.)
represents this pattern of growth, which is called **logistic growth** .

At what population size does growth start to slow in the logistic model
of growth? That depends on the population’s carrying capacity (see
**Figure**
[above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.)
). The **carrying capacity** (K) is the largest population size that can
be supported in an area without harming the environment. Population
growth hits a ceiling at that size in the logistic growth model.

#### *K* -Selected and *r* -Selected Species {#7.html#x-ck12-cnBxZmJiajJtYw.._19-alp}

Species can be divided into two basic types when it comes to how their
populations grow.

-   Species that live in stable environments are likely to be ***K***
    **-selected** . Their population growth is controlled by
    density-dependent factors. Population size is generally at or near
    the carrying capacity. These species are represented by curve B in
    **Figure**
    [above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.) .
-   Species that live in unstable environments are likely to be ***r***
    **-selected** . Their potential population growth is rapid. For
    example, they have large numbers of offspring. However, individuals
    are likely to die young. Thus, population size is usually well below
    the carrying capacity. These species are represented by the lower
    part of curve A in **Figure**
    [above](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE0LWV4cG9uZW50aWFsLWFuZC1sb2dpc3RpYy1ncm93dGg.) .
    ( *r* is the population growth rate. See the "Population
    Growth" concept.)

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-hst}

-   Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially.
-   The growth rate increases as the population gets larger.
-   Most populations do not live under ideal conditions and grow
    logistically instead.
-   Density-dependent factors slow population growth as population size
    nears the carrying capacity.

**How do humans adapt to their environment?**

It could be said that the human population does not have to adapt to its
environment, but forces the environment to change to suit us. We can
live practically anywhere we want, eat all types of food, and build all
types of housing. Because of all of these "adaptations," our population
has grown, after a slow start, considerably fast.

### The Human Population {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEh1bWFuIFBvcHVsYXRpb24._20-u3i}

Humans have been called the most successful "weed species" Earth has
ever seen. Like weeds, human populations are fast growing. They also
disperse rapidly. They have colonized habitats from pole to pole.
Overall, the human population has had a pattern of exponential growth,
as shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE1LWh1bWFuLXBvcHVsYXRpb24tZ3Jvd3Ro) .
The population increased very slowly at first. As it increased in size,
so did its rate of growth.

</div>

### Early Population Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgUG9wdWxhdGlvbiBHcm93dGg._20-vth}

***Homo sapiens*** arose about 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans
lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. They first
left Africa about 40,000 years ago. They soon moved throughout Europe,
Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, they had reached the Americas.
During this long period, birth and death rates were both fairly high. As
a result, population growth was slow.

Humans invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a
bigger, more dependable food supply. It also let them settle down in
villages and cities for the first time. The death rate increased because
of diseases associated with domestic animals and crowded living
conditions. The birth rate increased because there was more food and
settled life offered other advantages. The combined effect was continued
slow population growth.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-m5z}

-   Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters
    and gatherers. Both birth and death rates were fairly high. As a
    result, human population growth was very slow.
-   The invention of agriculture increased both birth and death rates.
    The population continued to grow slowly.

**Do populations continuously grow?**

Not necessarily. The growth of a population depends on a number of
issues. Obviously, the average age of the individuals of that population
is important. But other factors, such as the local economy, also play a
role.

### Demographic Transition {#7.html#x-ck12-RGVtb2dyYXBoaWMgVHJhbnNpdGlvbg.._21-wiz}

Major changes in the human population first began during the 1700s in
Europe and North America. First death rates fell, followed somewhat
later by birth rates.

#### Death Rates Fall {#7.html#x-ck12-RGVhdGggUmF0ZXMgRmFsbA.._21-zax}

Several advances in science and technology led to lower death rates in
18 ^th^ century Europe and North America:

-   New scientific knowledge of the causes of disease led to improved
    water supplies, sewers, and personal hygiene.
-   Better farming techniques and machines increased the food supply.
-   The Industrial Revolution of the 1800s led to new sources of energy,
    such as coal and electricity. This increased the efficiency of the
    new agricultural machines. It also led to train transport, which
    improved the distribution of food.

For all these reasons, death rates fell, especially in children. This
allowed many more children to survive to adulthood, so birth rates
increased. As the gap between birth and death rates widened, the human
population grew faster.

#### Birth Rates Fall {#7.html#x-ck12-QmlydGggUmF0ZXMgRmFsbA.._21-86h}

It wasn’t long before birth rates started to fall as well in Europe and
North America. People started having fewer children because large
families were no longer beneficial for several reasons.

-   As child death rates fell and machines did more work, farming
    families no longer needed to have as many children to work in
    the fields.
-   Laws were passed that required children to go to school. Therefore,
    they could no longer work and contribute to their own support. They
    became a drain on the family’s income.

Eventually, birth rates fell to match death rates. As a result,
population growth slowed to nearly zero.

#### Stages of the Demographic Transition {#7.html#x-ck12-U3RhZ2VzIG9mIHRoZSBEZW1vZ3JhcGhpYyBUcmFuc2l0aW9u_21-p9j}

These changes in population that occurred in Europe and North America
have been called the **demographic transition** . The transition can be
summarized in the following four stages, which are illustrated in
**Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE2LXN0YWdlcy1vZi1kZW1vZ3JhcGhpYy10cmFuc2l0aW9u)
:

-   Stage 1—High birth and death rates lead to slow population growth.
-   Stage 2—The death rate falls but the birth rate remains high,
    leading to faster population growth.
-   Stage 3—The birth rate starts to fall, so population growth starts
    to slow.
-   Stage 4—The birth rate reaches the same low level as the death rate,
    so population growth slows to zero.

-   Major changes in the human population first began during the 1700s.
    This occurred in Europe and North America.
-   First, death rates fell while birth rates remained high. This led to
    rapid population growth.
-   Later, birth rates also fell. As a result, population growth slowed.

**Should the population of the planet by characterized by individual
country, or as one general population?**

How many people is too many? Is there a limit? Is there a carrying
capacity for humans? These are important questions that do not have an
easy answer. But as our population continues to grow, these questions
and others should be discussed.

### Recent Population Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-UmVjZW50IFBvcHVsYXRpb24gR3Jvd3Ro_22-2qi}

At one time, scientists predicted that all human populations would pass
through the same **demographic transition** as Europe and North America.
Now, they are not so sure. Death rates have fallen throughout the world.
No country today remains in Stage 1 of the transition. However, birth
rates are still high in many poor countries. These populations seem to
be stuck in Stage 2. An example is the African country of Angola. Its
population pyramid for 2005 is shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE3LXBvcC1weXJhbWlkLWFuZ29sYQ..) . The
wide base of the pyramid base reflects the high birth rate of this
population.

Many other countries have shifted to Stage 3 of the transition. Birth
rates have started to fall. As a result, population growth is slowing.
An example is Mexico. Its population pyramid for 1998 is shown in
**Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE4LXBvcC1weXJhbWlkLW1leGljbw..) . It
reflects a recent fall in the birth rate.

Most developed nations have entered Stage 4. Sweden is an example (see
**Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTE5LXBvcC1weXJhbWlkLXN3ZWRlbg..) ). The
birth rate has been low for many years in Sweden. Therefore, the rate of
population growth is near zero.

In some countries, birth rates have fallen even lower than death rates.
As result, their population growth rates are negative. In other words,
the populations are shrinking in size. These populations have top-heavy
population pyramids, like the one for Italy shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTIwLXBvcC1weXJhbWlkLWl0YWx5) . This is a
new stage of the demographic transition, referred to as Stage 5. You
might think that a negative growth rate would be a good thing. In fact,
it may cause problems. For example, growth-dependent industries decline.
Supporting the large aging population is also a burden for the shrinking
younger population of workers.

### Future Population Growth {#7.html#x-ck12-RnV0dXJlIFBvcHVsYXRpb24gR3Jvd3Ro_22-ckn}

During the month of October 2011, the world's population surpassed 7
billion people. It took just 12 years for the population to increase by
a billion people. At this rate, there may be well over 9 billion people
by 2050, and easily 10 billion people by 2100. This raises many
questions for both people and the planet. These issues are discussed at
[http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/17/opinion/sachs-global-population/index.html](index.html)
.

The human population is now growing by more than 200,000 people a day.
The human population may well be close to its carrying capacity. It has
already harmed the environment. An even larger human population may
cause severe environmental problems. This could lead to outbreaks of
disease, starvation, and global conflict. There are three potential
solutions:

1.  Use technology to make better use of resources to support
    more people.
2.  Change behaviors to reduce human numbers and how much
    humans consume.
3.  Distribute resources more fairly among all the world’s people.

Which solution would you choose?

literally shoulder to shoulder" - Steven Hawking**

On June 30, 2011, Time.com published *Census Update: What the World Will
Look Like in 2050* at
[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2080404,00.html](0,8599,2080404,00.html)
. According to the U.S Census Bureau, in 2050, there will be 9.4 billion
people:

-   India will be the most populous nation, surpassing China sometime
    around 2025.
-   The U.S. will remain the third most populous nation, with a
    population of 423 million (up from 308 million in 2010).
-   Declining birth rates in Japan and Russia will cause them to fall
    from their current positions as the 9th and 10th most populous
    nations, respectively, to 16th and 17th.
-   Nigeria will have a population of 402 million, up from 166
    million people.
-   Ethiopia's population will likely triple, from 91 million to 278
    million, making the East African nation one of the top 10 most
    populous countries in the world.

So what does all this mean?

-   The African continent is expected to experience significant
    population growth in the coming decades, which could compound
    existing food supply problems in some African nations.
-   Immigration and differing birth rates among races will change the
    ethnic composition of the U.S.
-   Population booms in Africa and India, the decline of Russia, and the
    expected plateau of China will all change the makeup of the
    estimated 9.4 billion people who will call Earth home in 2050.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-zi3}

-   Other countries have completed similar demographic transitions.
    However, some countries seem stalled at early stages. They have high
    birth rates and rapidly growing populations.
-   The total human population may have to stop growing eventually. Even
    if we reduce our use of resources and distribute them more fairly,
    at some point the carrying capacity will be reached.

**What is biodiversity?**

How many species exist? We don't really know for sure. But all those
species together, from the smallest bacteria, the deadliest protist, the
most bizarre fungi, the prettiest plant, and the biggest mammal, compile
the diversity of life, or biodiversity.

### What Is Biodiversity? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBCaW9kaXZlcnNpdHk__23-c3y}

**Biodiversity** refers to the variety of life and its processes,
including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among
them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur. Scientists
have identified about 1.9 million species alive today. They are divided
into the six kingdoms of life shown in **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTIxLWJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eQ..) . Scientists
are still discovering new species. Thus, they do not know for sure how
many species really exist today. Most estimates range from 5 to 30
million species.

#### Cogs and Wheels {#7.html#x-ck12-Q29ncyBhbmQgV2hlZWxz_23-g3a}

***“The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the
pieces.”*** --attributed to Aldo Leopold, but probably a shortened
version of: ***“To save every cog and wheel is the first precaution of
intelligent tinkering.”*** **- Aldo Leopold,** ***Round River: from the
Journals of Aldo Leopold*** **, 1953**

What are the “cogs” and “wheels” of life?

Although the concept of biodiversity did not become a vital component of
biology and political science until nearly 40 years after Aldo Leopold’s
death in 1948, Leopold – often considered the father of modern ecology -
would have likely found the term an appropriate description of his “cogs
and wheels.” Literally, biodiversity is the many different kinds (
*diversity* ) of life ( *bio-* ). Biologists, however, always alert to
levels of organization, have identified three measures of life’s
variation. **Species diversity** best fits the literal translation: the
number of different species in a particular ecosystem or on Earth. A
second measure recognizes variation within a species: differences among
individuals or populations make up **genetic diversity** . Finally, as
Leopold clearly understood, the “cogs and wheels” include not only life
but also the land, sea, and air that support life. **Ecosystem
diversity** describes the many types of functional units formed by
living communities interacting with their environments. Although all
three levels of diversity are important, the term biodiversity usually
refers to species diversity.

**Why is biodiversity important?**

Think about how many species exist. Most likely well over 5 million. Now
think about how much information about those species we do not yet
understand. We do not know what we can learn from them.

### Why Is Biodiversity Important? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2h5IElzIEJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eSBJbXBvcnRhbnQ__24-pon}

Human beings benefit in many ways from **biodiversity** . Biodiversity
has direct economic benefits. It also provides services to entire
ecosystems.

#### Economic Benefits of Biodiversity {#7.html#x-ck12-RWNvbm9taWMgQmVuZWZpdHMgb2YgQmlvZGl2ZXJzaXR5_24-9sf}

The diversity of species provides humans with a wide range of economic
benefits:

-   Wild plants and animals maintain a valuable pool of **genetic
    variation** . This is important because domestic species are
    genetically uniform. This puts them at great risk of dying out due
    to disease.
-   Other organisms provide humans with many different products. Timber,
    fibers, adhesives, dyes, and rubber are just a few.
-   Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment. When the
    peregrine falcon nearly went extinct, for example, it warned us of
    the dangers of DDT.
-   More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from
    wild species. Only a fraction of species have yet been studied for
    their medical potential.
-   Other living things provide inspiration for engineering
    and technology. For example, the car design in **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTIyLWJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eS1iZW5lZml0cy1odW1hbnM.)

#### Ecosystem Services of Biodiversity {#7.html#x-ck12-RWNvc3lzdGVtIFNlcnZpY2VzIG9mIEJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eQ.._24-epy}

Biodiversity generally increases the productivity and stability of
**ecosystems** . It helps ensure that at least some species will survive
environmental change. It also provides many other ecosystem services.
For example:

-   Plants and algae maintain the atmosphere. During photosynthesis,
    they add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
-   Plants help prevent soil erosion. They also improve soil quality
    when they decompose.
-   Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes. They also return
    nutrients to the soil.
-   Bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants. Other
    bacteria recycle the nitrogen from organic wastes and remains of
    dead organisms.
-   Insects and birds pollinate flowering plants, including crop plants.
-   Natural predators control insect pests. They reduce the need for
    expensive pesticides, which may harm people and other living things.

**This is one of the most powerful birds in the world. Could it go
extinct?**

The Philippine Eagle, also known as the Monkey-eating Eagle, is among
the rarest, largest, and most powerful birds in the world. It is
critically endangered, mainly due to massive loss of habitat due to
deforestation in most of its range. Killing a Philippine Eagle is
punishable under Philippine law by twelve years in jail and heavy fines.

### Human Actions and the Sixth Mass Extinction {#7.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4gQWN0aW9ucyBhbmQgdGhlIFNpeHRoIE1hc3MgRXh0aW5jdGlvbg.._25-lxz}

Over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth have gone
extinct. Five mass extinctions are recorded in the fossil record. They
were caused by major geologic and climatic events. Evidence shows that a
**sixth mass extinction** is occurring now. Unlike previous mass
extinctions, the sixth extinction is due to human actions.

Some scientists consider the sixth extinction to have begun with early
hominids during the Pleistocene. They are blamed for over-killing big
mammals such as mammoths. Since then, human actions have had an ever
greater impact on other species. The present rate of extinction is
between 100 and 100,000 species per year. In 100 years, we could lose
more than half of Earth’s remaining species.

#### Causes of Extinction {#7.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIEV4dGluY3Rpb24._25-rhu}

The single biggest cause of extinction today is **habitat loss** .
Agriculture, forestry, mining, and urbanization have disturbed or
destroyed more than half of Earth’s land area. In the U.S., for example,
more than 99 percent of tall-grass prairies have been lost. Other causes
of extinction today include:

-   **Exotic species** introduced by humans into new habitats. They may
    carry disease, prey on native species, and disrupt food webs. Often,
    they can out-compete native species because they lack
    local predators. An example is described in **Figure**
    [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTIzLWJyb3duLXRyZWUtc25ha2U.) .
-   Over-harvesting of fish, trees, and other organisms. This threatens
    their survival and the survival of species that depend on them.
-   Global climate change, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels.
    This is raising Earth’s air and ocean temperatures. It is also
    raising sea levels. These changes threaten many species.
-   Pollution, which adds chemicals, heat, and noise to the environment
    beyond its capacity to absorb them. This causes widespread harm
    to organisms.
-   Human overpopulation, which is crowding out other species. It also
    makes all the other causes of extinction worse.

#### Effects of Extinction {#7.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBFeHRpbmN0aW9u_25-bov}

The results of a study released in the summer of 2011 have shown that
the decline in the numbers of large predators like sharks, lions and
wolves is disrupting Earth's ecosystem in all kinds of unusual ways. The
study, conducted by scientists from 22 different institutions in six
countries, confirmed the sixth mass extinction. The study states that
this mass extinction differs from previous ones because it is entirely
driven by human activity through changes in land use, climate,
pollution, hunting, fishing and poaching. The effects of the loss of
these large predators can be seen in the oceans and on land.

-   Fewer cougars in the western US state of Utah led to an explosion of
    the deer population. The deer ate more vegetation, which altered the
    path of local streams and lowered overall biodiversity.
-   In Africa, where lions and leopards are being lost to poachers,
    there is a surge in the number of olive baboons, who are
    transferring intestinal parasites to humans living nearby.
-   In the oceans, industrial whaling led a change in the diets of
    killer whales, who eat more sea lions, seals, and otters and have
    dramatically lowered the population counts of those species.

The study concludes that the loss of big predators has likely driven

#### How You Can Help Protect Biodiversity {#7.html#x-ck12-SG93IFlvdSBDYW4gSGVscCBQcm90ZWN0IEJpb2RpdmVyc2l0eQ.._25-81z}

There are many steps you can take to help protect biodiversity. For
example:

-   Consume wisely. Reduce your consumption wherever possible. Re-use or
    recycle rather than throw out and buy new. When you do buy new,
    choose products that are energy efficient and durable.
-   Avoid plastics. Plastics are made from petroleum and produce
    toxic waste.
-   Go organic. Organically grown food is better for your health. It
    also protects the environment from pesticides and excessive
    nutrients in fertilizers.
-   Save energy. Unplug electronic equipment and turn off lights when
    not in use. Take mass transit instead of driving.

and the issues facing these animals.

#### Lost Salmon {#7.html#x-ck12-TG9zdCBTYWxtb24._25-ztr}

Why is the salmon population of Northern California so important? Salmon
do not only provide food for humans, but also supply necessary nutrients
for their ecosystems. Because of a sharp decline in their numbers, in
part due to human interference, the entire salmon fishing season off
California and Oregon was canceled in both 2008 and 2009. The species in
the most danger of extinction is the California coho salmon. Explore the
important role salmon play in their native ecosystems and methods to
increase their numbers at

**Renewable or nonrenewable, what's the difference?**

That's like asking the difference between having an endless supply and
having a limited supply. Will this planet eventually run out of oil?
Probably. So oil is a nonrenewable resource.

### Renewable and Nonrenewable Resources {#7.html#x-ck12-UmVuZXdhYmxlIGFuZCBOb25yZW5ld2FibGUgUmVzb3VyY2Vz_26-kky}

A **natural resource** is something supplied by nature that helps
support life. When you think of natural resources, you may think of
minerals and fossil fuels. However, ecosystems and the services they
provide are also natural resources. **Biodiversity** is a natural
resource as well.

#### Renewable Resources {#7.html#x-ck12-UmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcw.._26-8fx}

**Renewable resources** can be replenished by natural processes as
quickly as humans use them. Examples include sunlight and wind. They are
in no danger of being used up (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTI0LXdpbmQtdHVyYmluZXM.) ). Metals and
other minerals are renewable too. They are not destroyed when they are
used and can be recycled.

Wind is a renewable resource. Wind turbines like this one harness just a
tiny fraction of wind energy.

</div>

Living things are considered to be renewable. This is because they can
reproduce to replace themselves. However, they can be over-used or
misused to the point of extinction. To be truly renewable, they must be
used sustainably. **Sustainable use** is the use of resources in a way
that meets the needs of the present and also preserves the resources for
future generations.

#### Nonrenewable Resources {#7.html#x-ck12-Tm9ucmVuZXdhYmxlIFJlc291cmNlcw.._26-uiz}

**Nonrenewable resources** are natural resources that exist in fixed
amounts and can be used up. Examples include fossil fuels such as
petroleum, coal, and natural gas. These fuels formed from the remains of
plants over hundreds of millions of years. We are using them up far
faster than they could ever be replaced. At current rates of use,
petroleum will be used up in just a few decades and coal in less than
300 years. Nuclear power is also considered to be a nonrenewable
resource because it uses up uranium, which will sooner or later run out.
It also produces harmful wastes that are difficult to dispose of safely.

**Could this land be used for agriculture?**

Probably not. The quality of soil is very important in determining what
can grow in a particular area. Good soil is not so easy to come by. Soil
should be considered another resource that we, as a population, must
strive to protect.

### Soil and Water Resources {#7.html#x-ck12-U29pbCBhbmQgV2F0ZXIgUmVzb3VyY2Vz_27-s63}

Theoretically, soil and water are renewable resources. However, they may
be ruined by careless human actions.

#### Soil {#7.html#x-ck12-U29pbA.._27-5vw}

**Soil** is a mixture of eroded rock, minerals, partly decomposed
organic matter, and other materials. It is essential for plant growth,
so it is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil is important for
other reasons as well. For example, it removes toxins from water and
breaks down wastes.

Although renewable, soil takes a very long time to form—up to hundreds
of millions of years. So, for human purposes, soil is a nonrenewable
resource. It is also constantly depleted of nutrients through careless
use, and eroded by wind and water. For example, misuse of soil caused a
huge amount of it to simply blow away in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl
(see **Figure** [below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTI1LWR1c3QtYm93bA..) ).
Soil must be used wisely to preserve it for the future. Conservation
practices include contour plowing and terracing. Both reduce soil
erosion. Soil also must be protected from toxic wastes.

The Dust Bowl occurred between 1933 and 1939 in Oklahoma and other
southwestern U.S. states. Plowing had exposed prairie soil. Drought
turned the soil to dust. Intense dust storms blew away vast quantities
of the soil. Much of the soil blew all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.

</div>

#### Water {#7.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXI._27-wsg}

Water is essential for all life on Earth. For human use, water must be
fresh. Of all the water on Earth, only 1 percent is fresh, liquid water.
Most of the rest is either salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers
and ice caps.

Although water is constantly recycled through the **water cycle** , it
is in danger. Over-use and pollution of freshwater threaten the limited
supply that people depend on. Already, more than 1 billion people
worldwide do not have adequate freshwater. With the rapidly growing
human population, the water shortage is likely to get worse.

#### KQED: Are We in Danger of Running Out of Water? {#7.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogQXJlIFdlIGluIERhbmdlciBvZiBSdW5uaW5nIE91dCBvZiBXYXRlcj8._27-r2v}

#### Too Much of a Good Thing {#7.html#x-ck12-VG9vIE11Y2ggb2YgYSBHb29kIFRoaW5n_27-dp5}

Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is
runoff. **Runoff** picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from
agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals
to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause
excessive growth of algae, creating **algal blooms** (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTI2LWFsZ2FlLWJsb29t) ). The algae use up
oxygen in the water so that other aquatic organisms cannot survive. This
has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating **dead zones** ,
where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. A very large dead
zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico. Measures that can help prevent these
problems include cutting down on fertilizer use. Preserving wetlands
also helps because wetlands filter runoff water.

**Why is the atmosphere important?**

Well, it contains all of the air that we breathe. The atmosphere also
has other roles and functions, so when we interfere with the atmosphere,
we interfere with some important biological processes. And this can have
consequences.

### The Atmosphere {#7.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEF0bW9zcGhlcmU._28-xhz}

The **atmosphere** plays an important part in maintaining Earth’s
freshwater supply. It is part of the water cycle. It refills lakes and
rivers with precipitation. The atmosphere also provides organisms with
gases needed for life. It contains oxygen for cellular respiration and
carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.

**Figure 7.55**

Air pollution comes from many sources, including waste expelled into the
atmosphere by numerous factories.

</div>

Earth’s atmosphere is vast. However, it has been seriously polluted by
human activities. **Air pollution** consists of chemical substances and
particles released into the atmosphere, mainly by human actions. The
major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels.
Power plants, motor vehicles, and home furnaces all burn fossil fuels
and contribute to the problem (see **Table**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6UG9sbHV0YW50LVByb2JsZW1z) ). Ranching and
using chemicals such as fertilizers also cause air pollution. Erosion of
soil in farm fields and construction sites adds dust particles to the
air as well. Fumes from building materials, furniture, carpets, and
paint add toxic chemicals to indoor air.

  Pollutant                          Example/Major Source                     Problem
  ---------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  Sulfur oxides (SO ~x~ )            Coal-fired power plants                  Acid Rain
  Nitrogen oxides (NO ~x~ )          Motor vehicle exhaust                    Acid Rain
  Carbon monoxide (CO)               Motor vehicle exhaust                    Poisoning
  Carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ )           All fossil fuel burning                  Global Warming
  Particulate matter (smoke, dust)   Wood and coal burning                    Respiratory disease, Global Dimming

  Ground-level ozone                 Motor vehicle exhaust                    Respiratory problems; eye irritation

In humans, air pollution causes respiratory and cardiovascular problems.
In fact, more people die each year from air pollution than automobile
accidents. Air pollution also affects ecosystems worldwide by causing
acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming. Ways to reduce air
pollution from fossil fuels include switching to nonpolluting energy
sources (such as solar energy) and using less energy. What are some ways
you could use less energy?

#### Acid Rain {#7.html#x-ck12-QWNpZCBSYWlu_28-bkk}

All life relies on a relatively narrow range of pH, or acidity. That’s
because protein structure and function are very sensitive to pH. Air
pollution can cause precipitation to become acidic. Nitrogen and sulfur
oxides, mainly from motor vehicle exhaust and coal burning, create acids
when they combine with water in the air. The acids lower the pH of
precipitation, forming **acid rain** . If acid rain falls on the ground,
it may damage soil and soil organisms. If it falls on plants, it may
kill them (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTI3LWFjaWQtcmFpbg..) ). If it falls into
lakes, it lowers the pH of the water and kills aquatic organisms.

#### Ozone Depletion {#7.html#x-ck12-T3pvbmUgRGVwbGV0aW9u_28-mlx}

There are two types of **ozone** . You can think of them as bad ozone
and good ozone. Both are affected by air pollution.

-   Bad ozone forms near the ground when sunlight reacts with pollutants
    in the air. Ground-level ozone is harmful to the respiratory systems
    of humans and other animals.
-   Good ozone forms in a thin layer high up in the atmosphere, between
    15 and 35 kilometers above Earth’s surface. This ozone layer shields
    Earth from most of the sun’s harmful UV radiation. It plays an
    important role in preventing mutations in the DNA of organisms.

Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air
pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are
released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone
has created an **ozone hole** over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results
in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this
increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen
cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of
the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has
slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._28-aqw}

-   Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released
    into the air, mainly by human actions.
-   The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of
    fossil fuels.
-   Indoor air can also be polluted.
-   Air pollution causes acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming.

**Is the Earth really fragile?**

Maybe not the planet, but how about the ecosystems? It may soon be hard
to argue that global climate change does not exist. Climate change can
definitely be seen in numerous ecosystems. So what will we do about it?

### Global Climate Change {#7.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIENsaW1hdGUgQ2hhbmdl_29-isl}

Another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change.
Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase
the natural greenhouse effect. This raises the temperature of Earth’s
surface.

See the NASA site *Global Climate Change - Vital Signs of the Planet* at
[http://climate.nasa.gov](climate.nasa.gov) for a thorough overview of
this topic.

#### What Is the Greenhouse Effect? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyB0aGUgR3JlZW5ob3VzZSBFZmZlY3Q__29-zhm}

The **greenhouse effect** is a natural feature of Earth’s atmosphere. It
occurs when gases in the atmosphere radiate the sun’s heat back down to
Earth’s surface (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTI4LWdyZWVuaG91c2UtZWZmZWN0) ).
Otherwise, the heat would escape into space. Without the greenhouse
effect, Earth’s surface temperature would be far cooler than it is. In
fact, it would be too cold to support life as we know it.

#### Global Warming {#7.html#x-ck12-R2xvYmFsIFdhcm1pbmc._29-53m}

**Global warming** refers to a recent increase in Earth’s average
surface temperature (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTI5LXRlbXBlcmF0dXJlLXJpc2U.) ). During
the past century, the temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F).
That may not seem like much. But consider that just 10°C is the
difference between an ice-free and an ice-covered Earth.

Most scientists agree that global warming is caused by more carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere (see **Figure**
[below](#7.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEyLTMwLUF0bW9zcGhlcmljLWNhcmJvbi1kaW94aWRl)
). This increases the greenhouse effect. There is more carbon dioxide
mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. Destroying forests is
another cause. With fewer forests, less carbon dioxide is removed from
the atmosphere by photosynthesis.

#### Effects of Climate Change {#7.html#x-ck12-RWZmZWN0cyBvZiBDbGltYXRlIENoYW5nZQ.._29-vuq}

How has global warming affected Earth and its life? Some of its effects
include:

-   Decline in cold-adapted species such as polar bears.
-   Melting of glaciers and rising sea levels.
-   Coastal flooding and shoreline erosion.
-   Heat-related human health problems.
-   More droughts and water shortages.
-   Changing patterns of precipitation.
-   Increasing severity of storms.
-   Major crop losses.

These two videos discuss some of the consequences from changes in
ecosystems:

#### KQED: Climate Watch: California at the Tipping Point {#7.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogQ2xpbWF0ZSBXYXRjaDogQ2FsaWZvcm5pYSBhdCB0aGUgVGlwcGluZyBQb2ludA.._29-gme}

The world's climate is changing and California is now being affected in
both dramatic and subtle ways. In 2008, scientists determined that
California’s temperatures increased by more than 2.1°F during the last
century. What’s more, the data showed that human activity has played a
significant role in that climate change. "What's just 2 degrees?" you
may wonder. But, as the science shows, just 2 degrees is extremely
significant.

What does all this temperature change mean? For starters, declining
mountain snowpack and prolonged drought conditions could pose a threat
to limited water supplies. Heat waves are projected to be longer,
bringing increased danger from wildfires and heat-related deaths. Rising
sea levels due to temperature shifts jeopardize life in coastal areas,
both for human communities and the plants and animals that rely on
intertidal and rich wetland ecosystems. Also, more precipitation is
expected to fall as rain rather than snow, thereby increasing the risk
of floods. And, as heat increases the formation of smog, poor air
quality could get even worse.

Climate change may also profoundly affect the economy in California and
elsewhere. Shorter ski seasons and damage to the marine ecosystem mean a
reduction in tourism. Water shortages mean issues with the commercial
and recreational fishing industry, and higher temperatures will affect
crop growth and quality, weakening the agricultural industry, to name
just a few of the economic issues associated with climate change.

#### KQED: Acidic Seas {#7.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogQWNpZGljIFNlYXM._29-fgl}

Melting glaciers, rising temperatures and droughts are all impacts of
global warming. But how does global warming actually affect the oceans?
The sea, it turns out, absorbs carbon dioxide emissions. The ocean acts
like a giant sponge, absorbing carbon dioxide emissions from the air.
And as we add more and more carbon dioxide to air by burning fossil
fuels, the ocean is absorbing it. On one level, it's done us a big
favor. Scientists say that we would be experiencing much more extreme
climate change were it not for the ocean's ability to remove the
heat-trapping gas. However, these emissions are causing the oceans to
become more acidic. Changing pH levels threaten entire marine food webs,
from coral reefs to salmon. See
[http://www.kqed.org/quest/radio/acidic-seas](acidic-seas) for
additional information.

#### What Can Be Done? {#7.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBDYW4gQmUgRG9uZT8._29-uia}

Efforts to reduce future global warming mainly involve energy use. We
need to use less energy, for example, by driving more fuel-efficient
cars. We also need to switch to energy sources that produce less carbon
dioxide, such as solar and wind energy. At the same time, we can
increase the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from air. We can
stop destroying forests and plant new ones.

### Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-umw}

-   Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels
    increase the natural greenhouse effect. This is raising the
    temperature of Earth’s surface, and is called global warming.

## Summary {#7.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-d4r}

Ecology discusses ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the
populations and the non-living aspects of the habitat. Whereas nutrients
and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in
just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem
are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems,
from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer
species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the
abiotic factors of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also
determine the stability of the system. Recent surges in the human
population have raised many important issues.

**What's the smallest living organism?**

Is it a virus? Or a bacterium? Are viruses living? We could not exist
without bacteria. Could we exist without viruses? These, and other
questions will be addressed through the *Prokaryotes and Viruses*

**What are the most numerous organisms on the planet?**

Bacteria. And all it takes is one to quickly grow, under just the right
conditions, into millions and billions. Luckily, we know how to control
bacteria when necessary. But bacteria do serve many important purposes.
In fact, we could not survive without them.

### Evolution of Prokaryotes {#8.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFByb2thcnlvdGVz-qbj}

No doubt you’ve had a sore throat before, and you’ve probably eaten
cheese or yogurt. If so, then you’ve encountered the fascinating world
of prokaryotes. **Prokaryotes** are single-celled organisms that lack a
nucleus. They also lack other membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes are
tiny and sometimes bothersome, but they are the most numerous organisms
on Earth. Without them, the world would be a very different place.
Prokaryotes are the simplest organisms. The first cells and organisms to
evolve would be classified as prokaryotic.

An overview of bacteria can be seen at

Prokaryotes are currently placed in two domains. A **domain** is the
highest **taxon** , just above the **kingdom** . The prokaryote domains
are **Bacteria** and **Archaea** (see **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTAxLWRvbWFpbnMtbGlmZQ..) ). The third
domain is **Eukarya** . It includes all eukaryotes. Unlike prokaryotes,
eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.

**Figure 8.1**

The Three Domains of Life. All living things are grouped in three
domains. The domains Bacteria and Archaea consist of prokaryotes. The
Eukarya domain consists of eukaryotes.

</div>

It’s not clear how the three domains are related. Archaea were once
thought to be offshoots of Bacteria that were adapted to extreme
environments. For their part, Bacteria were considered to be ancestors
of Eukarya. Scientists now know that Archaea share several traits with
Eukarya that Bacteria do not share (see **Table**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YmFjdGVyaWEtYXJjaGFlYS1ldWthcnlh) ). How
can this be explained? One hypothesis is that Eukarya arose when an
Archaean cell fused with a Bacterial cell. The two cells became the
nucleus and cytoplasm of a new Eukaryan cell. How well does this
hypothesis fit the evidence in **Table**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YmFjdGVyaWEtYXJjaGFlYS1ldWthcnlh) ?

**With so many different bacteria, how are they all classified?**

By shape? By size? By some other criteria? As you can imagine,
classifying bacteria is probably not an easy task. Bacteria are
classified by their traits, some of which have to do with their shape,
others with the cell wall, and even additional traits.

### The Prokaryotic Domains {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFByb2thcnlvdGljIERvbWFpbnM._1-bvf}

#### Domain Bacteria {#8.html#x-ck12-RG9tYWluIEJhY3Rlcmlh_1-msn}

Bacteria are the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth.
They live in almost all environments. They are found in the ocean, the
soil, and the intestines of animals. They are even found in rocks deep
below Earth’s surface. Any surface that has not been sterilized is
likely to be covered with bacteria. The total number of bacteria in the
world is amazing. It’s estimated to be 5 × 10 ^30^ , or five million
trillion. You have more bacteria in and on your body than you have body
cells!

Bacteria called **cyanobacteria** are very important. They are bluish
green in color (see **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTAyLWN5YW5vYmFjdGVyaWEtYmxvb20.) )
because they contain chlorophyll (but not chloroplasts, of course). They
make food through photosynthesis and release oxygen into the air. These
bacteria were probably responsible for adding oxygen to the air on early
Earth. This changed the planet’s atmosphere. It also changed the
direction of evolution. Ancient cyanobacteria also may have evolved into
the chloroplasts of plant cells.

</div>

Thousands of species of bacteria have been discovered, and many more are
thought to exist. The known species can be classified on the basis of
various traits. One classification is based on differences in their cell
walls and outer membranes. It groups bacteria into **Gram-positive** and
**Gram-negative** bacteria, as described in **Figure**

#### Domain Archaea {#8.html#x-ck12-RG9tYWluIEFyY2hhZWE._1-qpj}

Scientists still know relatively little about Archaea. This is partly
because they are hard to grow in the lab. Many live inside the bodies of
animals, including humans. However, none are known for certain to cause
disease.

Archaea were first discovered in extreme environments. For example, some
were found in hot springs. Others were found around deep sea vents. Such
Archaea are called **extremophiles** , or “lovers of extremes.”
**Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTA0LUV4dHJlbW9waGlsZS1BcmNoYWU.)
describes three different types of Archaean extremophiles. The places
where some of them live are thought to be similar to the environment on
ancient Earth. This suggests that they may have evolved very early in
Earth’s history.

the most abundant types of organisms on the planet. Archaea are also
thought to play important roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. For
these reasons, Archaea are now recognized as a major aspect of life on
Earth.

**Does the shape matter?**

It does if you're a bacterium. Prokaryotic cells are distinguished by
their shape. And as you can imagine, shape may have something to do with
mobility.

### Prokaryote Structure {#8.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90ZSBTdHJ1Y3R1cmU._2-mim}

Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Although
they are tiny, prokaryotic cells can be distinguished by their shapes.
The most common shapes are helices, spheres, and rods (see **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTA1LVByb2thcnlvdGljLWNlbGwtc2hhcGVz) ).

#### Plasma Membrane and Cell Wall {#8.html#x-ck12-UGxhc21hIE1lbWJyYW5lIGFuZCBDZWxsIFdhbGw._2-ebj}

Like other cells, prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane (see
**Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTA2LVByb2thcnlvdGljLUNlbGw.)
). It controls what enters and leaves the cell. It is also the site of
many metabolic reactions. For example, cellular respiration and
photosynthesis take place in the plasma membrane.

Most prokaryotes also have a cell wall. It lies just outside the plasma
membrane. It gives strength and rigidity to the cell. Bacteria and
Archaea differ in the makeup of their cell wall. The cell wall of
Bacteria contains **peptidoglycan** , composed of sugars and amino
acids. The cell wall of most Archaea lacks peptidoglycan.

diagram. The structure called a mesosome was once thought to be an

preparation. This is a good example of how scientific knowledge is
revised as more evidence becomes available. Can you identify each of the
labeled structures?

</div>

#### Cytoplasm and Cell Structures {#8.html#x-ck12-Q3l0b3BsYXNtIGFuZCBDZWxsIFN0cnVjdHVyZXM._2-mus}

Inside the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells is the cytoplasm. It
contains several structures, including ribosomes, a cytoskeleton, and
genetic material. Ribosomes are sites where proteins are made. The
cytoskeleton helps the cell keep its shape. The genetic material is
usually a single loop of DNA. There may also be small, circular pieces
of DNA, called **plasmids** . (see **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTA3LVByb2thcnlvdGljLUROQQ..) ). The
cytoplasm may contain microcompartments as well. These are tiny
structures enclosed by proteins. They contain enzymes and are involved
in metabolic processes.

because the cell lacks a nucleus.

</div>

#### Extracellular Structures {#8.html#x-ck12-RXh0cmFjZWxsdWxhciBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVz_2-aho}

Many prokaryotes have an extra layer, called a capsule, outside the cell
wall. The **capsule** protects the cell from chemicals and from drying
out. It also allows the cell to stick to surfaces and to other cells.
Because of this, many prokaryotes can form biofilms, like the one shown
in **Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTA4LWJpb2ZpbG0.) . A
**biofilm** is a colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface such
as a rock or a host’s tissues. The sticky plaque that collects on your
teeth between brushings is a biofilm. It consists of millions of
bacteria.

Most prokaryotes also have long, thin protein structures called
**flagella** (singular, **flagellum** ). They extend from the plasma
membrane. Flagella help prokaryotes move. They spin around a fixed base,
causing the cell to roll and tumble. As shown in **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTA5LWZsYWdlbGxhLXZhcmlhdGlvbnM.) ,
prokaryotes may have one or more flagella.

#### Endospores {#8.html#x-ck12-RW5kb3Nwb3Jlcw.._2-gav}

Many organisms form spores for reproduction. Some prokaryotes form
spores for survival. Called **endospores** , they form inside
prokaryotic cells when they are under stress. The stress could be UV
radiation, high temperatures, or harsh chemicals. Endospores enclose the
DNA and help it survive under conditions that may kill the cell.
Endospores are commonly found in soil and water. They may survive for
long periods of time.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-csj}

**What do bacteria need to grow?**

Like most everything else, they need food. Given the right conditions,
bacteria can grow from just a few cells to millions or billions
overnight.

### Prokaryote Metabolism {#8.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90ZSBNZXRhYm9saXNt_3-pbe}

Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet
these needs in a variety of ways. In fact, prokaryotes have just about
every possible type of **metabolism** . They may get energy from light
(photo) or chemical compounds (chemo). They may get carbon from carbon
dioxide ( **autotroph** ) or other living things ( **heterotroph** ).
Most prokaryotes are **chemoheterotrophs** . They depend on other
organisms for both energy and carbon. Many break down organic wastes and
the remains of dead organisms. They play vital roles as decomposers and
help recycle carbon and nitrogen. **Photoautotrophs** are important
producers. They are especially important in aquatic ecosystems.

#### Classification of Prokaryotes Based on Metabolism {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgUHJva2FyeW90ZXMgQmFzZWQgb24gTWV0YWJvbGlzbQ.._3-q0n}

Two major nutritional needs can be used to group prokaryotes. These are
(1) carbon metabolism, their source of carbon for building organic
molecules within the cells, and (2) energy metabolism, their source of
energy used for growth.

In terms of carbon metabolism, prokaryotes are classified as either
heterotrophic or autotrophic:

-   Heterotrophic organisms use organic compounds, usually from other
    organisms, as carbon sources.
-   Autotrophic organisms use carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) as their only
    source or their main source of carbon. Many autotrophic bacteria are
    photosynthetic, and get their carbon from the carbon dioxide in
    the atmosphere.

Energy metabolism in prokaryotes is classified as one of the following:

-   Phototrophic organisms capture light energy from the sun and convert
    it into chemical energy inside their cells.
-   Chemotrophic organisms break down either organic or inorganic
    molecules to supply energy for the cell. Some chemotrophic organisms
    can also use their organic energy-supplying molecules as a carbon
    supply, which would make them chemoheterotrophs.
-   **Photoheterotrophs** are organisms that capture light energy to
    convert to chemical energy in the cells, but they get carbon from
    organic sources (other organisms). Examples are purple non-sulfur
    bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria and heliobacteria.
-   Chemoheterotrophs are organisms that get their energy source and
    carbon source from organic sources. Chemoheterotrophs must consume
    organic building blocks that they are unable to make themselves.
    Most get their energy from organic molecules such as sugars. This
    nutritional mode is very common among eukaryotes, including humans.
-   Photoautotrophs are cells that capture light energy, and use carbon
    dioxide as their carbon source. There are many photoautotrophic
    prokaryotes, which include cyanobacteria. Photoautotrophic
    prokaryotes use similar compounds to those of plants to trap
    light energy.
-   **Chemoautotrophs** are cells that break down inorganic molecules to
    supply energy for the cell, and use carbon dioxide as a
    carbon source. Chemoautotrophs include prokaryotes that break down
    hydrogen sulfide (H ~2~ S the “rotten egg” smelling gas), and
    ammonia (NH ~4~ ). *Nitrosomonas* , a species of soil bacterium,
    oxidizes NH ~4~ ^+^ to nitrite (NO ~2~ ^-^ ). This reaction releases
    energy that the bacteria use. Many chemoautotrophs also live in
    extreme environments such as deep sea vents.

This flowchart helps to determine if a species is an autotroph or a
heterotroph, a phototroph or a chemotroph. For example, “Obtain carbon
elsewhere?” asks if the source of carbon is another organism. If the
answer is “yes”, the organism is heterotrophic. If the answer is “no,”
the organisms is autotrophic.

**Where do you find lots of bacteria?**

Practically all surfaces. Bacteria can live and grow in practically any
environment. It is this ability that has made bacteria the most numerous
species on the planet.

### Prokaryote Habitats {#8.html#x-ck12-UHJva2FyeW90ZSBIYWJpdGF0cw.._4-xkr}

Prokaryotes have a wide range of metabolisms, and this determines where
they live. They live in a particular habitat because they are able to
“eat” whatever is around them. For example, there are bacteria and
archaea that break down hydrogen sulfide to produce ATP. Hydrogen
sulfide is the gas that gives rotten eggs and sewage their distinctive
smell. It is poisonous to animals, but some prokaryotes depend on it for
life.

Organisms that are **obligate aerobes** need oxygen to live. That is,
they use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor while making ATP (see
the “Cellular Respiration” concept). Humans are obligate aerobes, and so
are *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria. *M. tuberculosis* causes
tuberculosis (TB). Obligate aerobes are found only in places with
molecular oxygen.

An **anaerobic** organism is any organism that does not need oxygen for
growth and even dies in its presence. **Obligate anaerobes** will die
when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen. *Clostridium perfringens*
bacteria, which are commonly found in soil around the world, are
obligate anaerobes. Infection of a wound by *C. perfringens* bacteria
causes the disease gas gangrene. Obligate anaerobes use molecules other
than oxygen as terminal electron acceptors.

**Facultative anaerobic** organisms, which are usually prokaryotic, make
ATP by aerobic respiration, if oxygen is present, but can also survive
without oxygen. In the absence of oxygen they switch to the process of
fermentation to make ATP. **Fermentation** is a type of heterotrophic
metabolism that uses organic carbon instead of oxygen as a terminal
electron acceptor. Examples of facultative anaerobic bacteria are the
*Staphylococci* , *Escherichia coli* , *Corynebacterium* , and
*Listeria* species. Many bacteria that cause human diseases are
facultative anaerobic organisms.

#### Temperature {#8.html#x-ck12-VGVtcGVyYXR1cmU._4-th1}

Like most organisms, prokaryotes live and grow best within certain
temperature ranges. Prokaryotes can be classified by their temperature
preferences, as shown in the **Table**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cHJva2FyeW90ZS10ZW1w) . Which type of
prokaryote would you expect to find inside the human body?

**Thermophiles** live at relatively high temperatures, above 45°C
(113°F). Thermophiles are found in geothermally heated regions of the
Earth, such as hot springs like the Morning Glory pool in Yellowstone
National Park (see **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMS0yMGE.) ), and deep sea
hydrothermal vents. Some thermophiles live in decaying plant matter such
as peat bogs and compost. Many thermophiles are archaea. Extreme
thermophiles (or **hyperthermophiles** ), live in temperatures hotter
than 80°C (176°F).

**Psychrophiles** grow and reproduce in cold temperatures. The optimal
growth temperature of some psychrophiles is 15°C or lower; they cannot
grow in temperatures above 20°C. The environments that psychrophiles
inhabit are found all over Earth. Psychrophiles live in such places as
permafrost soils, deep-ocean waters, Arctic and Antarctic glaciers and
snowfields.

**Mesophiles** grow best in moderate temperature, typically between 25°C
and 40°C (77°F and 104°F). Mesophiles are often found living in or on
the bodies of humans or other animals. The optimal growth temperature of
many pathogenic mesophiles is 37°C (98°F), the normal human body
temperature. Mesophilic organisms have important uses in food
preparation, including cheese, yogurt, beer and wine.

  Type of Prokaryote   Preferred Temperature   Where It Might Be Found
  -------------------- ----------------------- -------------------------
  Thermophile          above 45°C (113°F)      in compost
  Mesophile            about 37°C (98°F)       inside animals
  Psychrophile         below 20°C (68°F)       in the deep ocean

The Morning Glory pool of Yellowstone National Park in the United States
is a geothermal pool whose waters are heated to high temperatures by
magma deep underground. Hyperthermophilic organisms, such as members of
the archaeal genus *Sulfolobus* can live at temperatures between
60°C-80°C and a pH of 3.

**How do bacteria reproduce?**

Essentially, they grow and divide. Show here is an example of
Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* , or MRSA, bacteria.
Notice how one bacterium is dividing into two.

### Reproduction in Prokaryotes {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIGluIFByb2thcnlvdGVz_5-mjv}

Unlike multicellular organisms, increases in the size of prokaryotes
(cell growth) and their reproduction by cell division are tightly
linked. Prokaryotes grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through
**binary fission.** For a discussion of exponential growth and bacteria
see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3MI0ZX5WRc](watch?v=-3MI0ZX5WRc)
(10:43).

#### Binary Fission {#8.html#x-ck12-QmluYXJ5IEZpc3Npb24._5-liy}

Binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction. It occurs when a
parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells. This can result in
very rapid population growth. For example, under ideal conditions,
bacterial populations can double every 20 minutes. Such rapid population
growth is an adaptation to an unstable environment. Can you explain why?

cell wall, respectively. The DNA inside the bacterium is copied and the
daughter cells receive an exact copy of the parent DNA. Fission involves
a cytoskeletal protein FtsZ that forms a ring at the site of cell
division.

</div>

#### Genetic Transfer {#8.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXRpYyBUcmFuc2Zlcg.._5-dxc}

In asexual reproduction, all the offspring are exactly the same. This is
the biggest drawback of this type of reproduction. Why? Lack of genetic
variation increases the risk of extinction. Without variety, there may
be no organisms that can survive a major change in the environment.

Prokaryotes have a different way to increase genetic variation. It’s
called **genetic transfer** or **bacterial conjugation** . It can occur
in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their
environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually
plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMS0yMmE.) , the donor cell makes a
structure called an **F pilus** , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one
cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic
material, usually a **plasmid** , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic
transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to
create bacterial cells that carry new genes.

**Can you guess what organisms are pictured here?**

Are they fat green worms on a red leaf? Here’s a clue: There are more
organisms like these than any other on Earth. Here’s another clue: Each
organism consists of a single cell without a nucleus.

The organisms are bacteria called *Salmonella* . If the word Salmonella
rings a bell, that’s probably because *Salmonella* causes human diseases
such as food poisoning. Many other types of bacteria also cause human
diseases. But not all bacteria are harmful to people. In fact, we could
not survive without many of the trillions of bacteria that live in or on
the human body.

### Bacteria and Humans {#8.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWEgYW5kIEh1bWFucw.._6-hcd}

Bacteria and humans have many important relationships. Bacteria make our
lives easier in a number of ways. In fact, we could not survive without
them. On the other hand, bacteria can also make us sick.

#### Benefits of Bacteria {#8.html#x-ck12-QmVuZWZpdHMgb2YgQmFjdGVyaWE._6-rfe}

Bacteria provide vital ecosystem services. They are important
decomposers. They are also needed for the carbon and nitrogen cycles.
There are billions of bacteria inside the human intestines. They help
digest food, make vitamins, and play other important roles. Humans also
use bacteria in many other ways, including:

-   Creating products, such as ethanol and enzymes.
-   Making drugs, such as antibiotics and vaccines.
-   Making biogas, such as methane.
-   Cleaning up oil spills and toxic wastes.
-   Killing plant pests.
-   Transferring normal genes to human cells in gene therapy.
-   Fermenting foods (see **Figure**
    [below](#8.html#x-ck12-YmlvLTEzLTExLUZlcm1lbnRlZC1Gb29kcw..) ).

#### Bacteria and Disease {#8.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWEgYW5kIERpc2Vhc2U._6-xpu}

You have ten times as many bacteria as human cells in your body. Most of
these bacteria are harmless. However, bacteria can also cause disease.
Examples of bacterial diseases include tetanus, syphilis, and food
poisoning. Bacteria may spread directly from one person to another. For
example, they can spread through touching, coughing, or sneezing. They
may also spread via food, water, or objects.

Another way bacteria and other pathogens can spread is by vectors. A
**vector** is an organism that spreads pathogens from host to host.
Insects are the most common vectors of human diseases. **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTEyLUJhY3RlcmlhbC1EaXNlYXNlLVZlY3RvcnM.)
shows two examples.

Bacterial Disease Vectors. Ticks spread bacteria that cause Lyme
disease. Deerflies spread bacteria that cause tularemia.

</div>

Humans have literally walked into some new bacterial diseases. When
people come into contact with wild populations, they may become part of
natural cycles of disease transmission. Consider Lyme disease. It’s
caused by bacteria that normally infect small, wild mammals, such as
mice. A tick bites a mouse and picks up the bacteria. The tick may then
bite a human who invades the natural habitat. Through the bite, the
bacteria are transmitted to the human host.

#### Controlling Bacteria {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbGxpbmcgQmFjdGVyaWE._6-xba}

Bacteria in food or water usually can be killed by heating it to a high
temperature (generally, at least 71°C, or 160°F). Bacteria on many
surfaces can be killed with chlorine bleach or other disinfectants.
Bacterial infections in people can be treated with **antibiotic drugs**
. For example, if you ever had “strep” throat, you were probably treated
with an antibiotic.

Antibiotics have saved many lives. However, misuse and over-use of the
drugs have led to **antibiotic resistance** in bacteria. **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTEzLWV2b2x1dGlvbi1vZi1hbml0YmlvdGljLXJlc2lzdGFuY2UtaW4tYmFjdGVyaWE.)
shows how antibiotic resistance evolves. Some strains of bacteria are
now resistant to most common antibiotics. These infections are very
difficult to treat.

**This virus looks alive, but is it?**

Notice the big virus. He (or she) looks very angry. But actually viruses
cannot be a "he" or a "she" - or big either. In fact, viruses are the
smallest things. Much smaller than most prokaryotes. We also cannot say
that viruses are the smallest living things or organisms, as viruses do
not meet the definition of living or of an organism.

### Characteristics of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFZpcnVzZXM._7-jso}

Which of the three domains of life do viruses belong to? None. Why?
Viruses are usually considered to be nonliving. Viruses do not meet most
of the criteria of life. They are not even made of cells.

An overview of viruses can be seen at

A **virus** is a sub-microscopic particle that can infect living cells.
Viruses are much smaller than prokaryotes, ranging in size from about
20–300 nanometers (nm), though some can be larger. Prokaryotes are
typically 0.5–5.0 micrometres (µm) in length. For example, if a virus
was about the size of three soccer balls lying side-by-side, then a
prokaryote would be about the size of soccer field.

An individual virus is called a **virion.** It is a tiny particle much
smaller than a prokaryotic cell. Because viruses do not consist of
cells, they also lack cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and other
cell organelles. Without these structures, they are unable to make
proteins or even reproduce on their own. Instead, they must depend on a
host cell to synthesize their proteins and to make copies of themselves.
Although viruses are not classified as living things, they share two
important traits with living things. They have genetic material, and
they can evolve. This is why the classification of viruses has been
controversial. It calls into question just what it means to be alive.
What do you think? How would you classify viruses?

The study of viruses is known as **virology** and people who study
viruses are known as **virologists** . Viruses infect and live inside
the cells of living organisms. When viruses infect the cells of their
host, they may cause disease. For example, viruses cause AIDS (Acquired
immune deficiency syndrome), influenza (flu), chicken pox, and the
common cold. Therapy is sometimes difficult for viral diseases.
Antibiotics have no effect on viruses and only a few antiviral drugs are
available for some diseases. One of the best ways to prevent viral
diseases is with a **vaccine** , which produces **immunity** . But
vaccines are available for only a few diseases.

Mimivirus, shown in the **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMS0wMQ..) , is the largest known
virus, with a diameter of 400 nm. Protein filaments measuring 100 nm
stick out from the surface of the virus, which increases the diameter of
the virus to about 600 nm. This is bigger than a small bacterial cell.
The virus appears hexagonal under an electron microscope; the viral
shape is icosahedral (having 20 faces or sides).

**Figure 8.17**

The largest known virus, called mimivirus, is so large that scientists
first mistook it for a bacterium. It was first discovered in amoeba, in
1992, and was identified as a virus in 2003. Scientists believe that
mimivirus may cause certain types of pneumonia in humans. The core
contains DNA, with the majority of the DNA in genes, and only 10% DNA of
unknown function ("junk" DNA).

</div>

#### Replication {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24._7-sr8}

Viruses can replicate only by infecting a host cell. They cannot
reproduce on their own. Viruses are not cells; they are a strand of
genetic material within a protective protein coat called a **capsid** .
They infect a wide variety of organisms, including both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes. Once inside the cell, they use the cell’s ATP, ribosomes,
enzymes, and other cellular parts to replicate.

#### Habitats {#8.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdHM._7-qmj}

Viruses can be found almost anywhere there is life, including living
within prokaryotes. A **phage** is a virus that infects prokaryotes.
Phages are estimated to be the most widely distributed and diverse
entities in the biosphere, even more numerous than prokaryotic
organisms. Phages can be found everywhere their hosts are found, such as
in soil, in the intestine of animals, or seawater. Up to 10 ^9^ virions
have been found in a milliliter of seawater, and up to 70 percent of
marine bacteria may be infected by phages. They are also found in
drinking water and in some foods, including fermented vegetables and
meats, where they control the growth of bacteria.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-n5t}

-   Viruses are tiny particles, smaller than prokaryotic cells.
-   Viruses are not cells and cannot replicate without help, but they
    have nucleic acids and can evolve.

**Is this a cell or a virus?**

It is actually a representation of the HIV virus, the virus that causes
AIDS. All the little “knobs” on the outside of the virus help to give
the virus structure. And it is this structure that must be identified by
a vaccine.

### Structure of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIFZpcnVzZXM._8-vfl}

Viruses vary in their structure. A virus particle consists of DNA or RNA
within a protective protein coat called a **capsid.** The shape of the
capsid may vary from one type of virus to another. The capsid is made
from the proteins that are encoded by viral genes within their genome.

The shape of the capsid serves as one basis for classification of
viruses. The capsid of the virus shown in **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMS0wMg..) is icosahedral. Virally
coded proteins will self-assemble to form a capsid. Some viruses have an
envelope of phospholipids and proteins. The envelope is made from
portions of the host’s cell membrane. It surrounds the capsid and helps
protect the virus from the host’s immune system. The envelope may also
have receptor molecules that can bind with host cells. They make it
easier for the virus to infect the cells.

**Figure 8.18**

of the virus. The envelope which surrounds the capsid is typically made
from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins).
Not all viruses have a viral envelope.

</div>

#### Helical Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-SGVsaWNhbCBWaXJ1c2Vz_8-qfd}

**Helical capsids** are made up of a single type of protein subunit
stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure. The helix may
have a hollow center, which makes it look like a hollow tube. This
arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions. These virions
can be anything from short and very rigid, to long and very flexible.
The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is an example of a helical
virus, as seen in the **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMS0wMw..) .

#### Icosahedral Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-SWNvc2FoZWRyYWwgVmlydXNlcw.._8-wng}

**Icosahedral capsid** symmetry gives viruses a spherical appearance at
low magnification, but the protein subunits are actually arranged in a
regular geometrical pattern, similar to a soccer ball; they are not
truly spherical. An icosahedral shape is the most efficient way of
creating a hardy structure from multiple copies of a single protein.
This shape is used because it can be built from a single basic unit
protein which is used over and over again. This saves space in the viral
genome.

shape made up of 20 equilateral triangles. Viral structures are built of
repeated identical protein subunits, making the icosahedron the easiest
shape to assemble using these subunits.

</div>

#### Complex Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGxleCBWaXJ1c2Vz_8-uar}

**Complex viruses** possess a capsid which is neither purely helical,
nor purely icosahedral, and which may have extra structures such as
protein tails or a complex outer wall. Viral protein subunits will
self-assemble into a capsid, but the complex viruses DNA also codes for
proteins which help in building the viral capsid. Many phage viruses are
complex-shaped; they have an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail.
The tail may have a base plate with protein tail fibers. Some complex
viruses do not have tail fibers.

#### Enveloped Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-RW52ZWxvcGVkIFZpcnVzZXM._8-nnt}

Some viruses are able to surround (envelop) themselves in a portion of
the cell membrane of their host. The virus can use either the outer
membrane of the host cell, or an internal membrane such as the nuclear
membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. In this way the virus gains an outer
lipid bilayer known as a **viral envelope** . This membrane is studded
with proteins coded for by both the viral genome and the host genome.
However, the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present come
entirely from the host cell. The influenza virus, HIV, and the varicella
zoster virus ( **Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMS0wNg..) )
are enveloped viruses.

</div>

The viral envelope can give a virus some advantages over other
capsid-only viruses. For example, they have better protection from the
host's immune system, enzymes and certain chemicals. The proteins in the
envelope can include glycoproteins, which act as receptor molecules.
These receptor molecules allow host cells to recognize and bind the
virions, which may result in easier uptake of the virion into the cell.
Most enveloped viruses depend on their envelopes to infect cells.
However, because the envelope contains lipids, it makes the virus more
susceptible to inactivation by environmental agents, such as detergents
that disrupt lipids.

**How are viruses classified?**

In part by their shape. This picture represents a bacteriophage, a virus
that infects bacteria. Notice the distinctive shape. This virus has a
complex shape.

### Classification of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgVmlydXNlcw.._9-bqr}

Like the classification systems for cellular organisms, virus
classification is the subject of ongoing debate. This is largely due to
the nature of viruses, which are not living organisms by the classic
definition, but neither are they necessarily non-living. Therefore,
viruses do not fit neatly into the biological classification system of
cellular organisms, as plants and animals do.

Virus classification is based mainly on characteristics of the viral
particles, including the **capsid** shape, the type of nucleic acid (DNA
or RNA, double stranded (ds) or single stranded (ss)) within the capsid,
the process of replication, their host organisms, or the type of disease
they cause. The **Table** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dmlydXNlcw..)
lists characteristics such as capsid shape, presence of an envelope, and
the diseases the viruses can cause.

**Can you "discover" something without actually seeing it?**

Well, yes you can, and that's precisely how viruses were discovered.
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria, so special microscopes are
needed to see them, but the existence of viruses was known prior to the
development of these special microscopes.

### Discovery and Origin of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-RGlzY292ZXJ5IGFuZCBPcmlnaW4gb2YgVmlydXNlcw.._10-dm2}

Viruses are so small that they can be seen only with an electron
microscope. Before electron microscopes were invented, scientists knew
viruses must exist. How did they know? They had demonstrated that
particles smaller than bacteria cause disease.

#### Discovery of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-RGlzY292ZXJ5IG9mIFZpcnVzZXM._10-ruw}

Researchers used special filters to remove bacteria from tissues that
were infected. If bacteria were causing the infection, the filtered
tissues should no longer be able to make other organisms sick. However,
the filtered tissues remained infective. This meant that something even
smaller than bacteria was causing the infection.

Scientists did not actually see viruses for the first time until the
1930s. That’s when the **electron microscope** was invented. In 1915,
English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered **bacteriophage** ,
the viruses that attack bacteria. He noticed tiny clear spots within
bacterial colonies, and hypothesized that something was killing the
bacteria. The **tobacco mosaic virus** shown in **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTE1LXRvYmFjY28tbW9zYWljLXZpcnVz) was the
first one to be seen.

#### Origin of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-T3JpZ2luIG9mIFZpcnVzZXM._10-ees}

Where did viruses come from? How did the first viruses arise? The
answers to these questions are not known for certain. Several hypotheses
have been proposed. The two main hypotheses are stated below. Both may
be valid and explain the origin of different viruses.

-   Small viruses started as runaway pieces of nucleic acid that
    originally came from living cells such as bacteria.
-   Large viruses were once parasitic cells inside bigger host cells.
    Over time, genes needed to survive and reproduce outside host cells
    were lost.

**Notice the viruses sitting on the bacteria?**

Why is the virus sitting here? Remember, viruses are not living. So how
do they replicate?

### Replication of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24gb2YgVmlydXNlcw.._11-yta}

Populations of viruses do not grow through cell division because they
are not cells. Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host
cell to produce new copies of themselves. After infecting a host cell, a
virion uses the cell’s ribosomes, enzymes, ATP, and other components to
replicate. Viruses vary in how they do this. For example:

-   Some RNA viruses are translated directly into viral proteins in
    ribosomes of the host cell. The host ribosomes treat the viral RNA
    as though it were the host’s own mRNA.
-   Some DNA viruses are first transcribed in the host cell into
    viral mRNA. Then the viral mRNA is translated by host cell ribosomes
    into viral proteins.

In either case, the newly made viral proteins assemble to form new
virions. The virions may then direct the production of an enzyme that
breaks down the host cell wall. This allows the virions to burst out of
the cell. The host cell is destroyed in the process. The newly released
virus particles are free to infect other cells of the host.

#### Replication of RNA Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24gb2YgUk5BIFZpcnVzZXM._11-hb8}

An **RNA virus** is a virus that has RNA as its genetic material. Their
nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA, but may be double-stranded
RNA. Important human pathogenic RNA viruses include the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, Influenza virus, and Hepatitis C
virus. Animal RNA viruses can be placed into different groups depending
on their type of replication.

-   Some RNA viruses have their genome used directly as if it were mRNA.
    The viral RNA is translated directly into new viral proteins after
    infection by the virus.
-   Some RNA viruses carry enzymes which allow their RNA genome to act
    as a template for the host cell to a form viral mRNA.
-   **Retroviruses** use DNA intermediates to replicate. **Reverse
    transcriptase** , a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself,
    converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is
    copied to produce a double stranded molecule of viral DNA. This
    viral DNA is then transcribed and translated by the host machinery,
    directing the formation of new virions. Normal transcription
    involves the synthesis of RNA from DNA; hence, reverse transcription
    is the *reverse* of this process. This is an exception to the
    central dogma of molecular biology.

#### Replication of DNA Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-UmVwbGljYXRpb24gb2YgRE5BIFZpcnVzZXM._11-2eq}

A **DNA virus** is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and
replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The nucleic acid is
usually double-stranded DNA but may also be single-stranded DNA. The DNA
of DNA viruses is transcribed into mRNA by the host cell. The viral mRNA
is then translated into viral proteins. These viral proteins then
assemble to form new viral particles.

#### Reverse-Transcribing Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-UmV2ZXJzZS1UcmFuc2NyaWJpbmcgVmlydXNlcw.._11-16a}

A **reverse-transcribing virus** is any virus which replicates using
reverse transcription, the formation of DNA from an RNA template. Some
reverse-transcribing viruses have genomes made of single-stranded RNA
and use a DNA intermediate to replicate. Others in this group have
genomes that have double-stranded DNA and use an RNA intermediate during
genome replication. The retroviruses, as mentioned above, are included
in this group, of which HIV is a member. Some double-stranded DNA
viruses replicate using reverse transcriptase. The hepatitis B virus is
one of these viruses.

#### Bacteriophages {#8.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaW9waGFnZXM._11-fdy}

**Bacteriophages** are viruses that infect bacteria. They bind to
surface receptor molecules of the bacterial cell and then their genome
enters the cell. The protein coat does not enter the bacteria. Within a
short amount of time, in some cases, just minutes, bacterial polymerase
starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to
become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins which help
assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral
enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane. With some phages,
just over twenty minutes after the phage infects the bacterium, over
three hundred phages can be assembled and released from the host.

    metabolism to produce new copies of itself.

**Viral or bacterial?**

Doesn't look like fun. The flu is caused by an influenza virus. And
usually a slightly different virus every season.

### Viruses and Human Disease {#8.html#x-ck12-VmlydXNlcyBhbmQgSHVtYW4gRGlzZWFzZQ.._12-slj}

Viruses cause many human diseases. In addition to the flu and HIV,
viruses cause rabies, measles, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, polio,
cold sores and other diseases (see **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTE2LWNvbGQtc29yZQ..) ). Viral diseases
range from mild to fatal. One way viruses cause disease is by causing
host cells to burst open and die. Viruses may also cause disease without
killing host cells. They may cause illness by disrupting homeostasis in
host cells.

</div>

Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body. This is called
**latency** . For example, the virus that causes chicken pox may infect
a young child and cause the short-term disease chicken pox. Then the
virus may remain latent in nerve cells within the body for decades. The
virus may re-emerge later in life as the disease called shingles. In
shingles, the virus causes painful skin rashes with blisters (see
**Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTEzLTE3LXNoaW5nbGVz) ).

Some viruses can cause cancer. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV)
causes cancer of the cervix in females. Hepatitis B virus causes cancer
of the liver. A viral cancer is likely to develop only after a person
has been infected with a virus for many years.

#### The Flu {#8.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZsdQ.._12-hik}

**Influenza,** or flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by
influenza viruses. Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal
epidemics. An **epidemic** is an outbreak of a disease within a
population of people during a specific time. Every year in the United
States, about 200,000 people are hospitalized and 36,000 people die from
the flu. Flu pandemics can kill millions of people. A **pandemic** is an
epidemic that spreads through human populations across a large region
(for example a continent), or even worldwide. Three influenza pandemics
occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with
each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new strain
of the virus. Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by
disinfectants and detergents.

#### Emerging Viral Diseases {#8.html#x-ck12-RW1lcmdpbmcgVmlyYWwgRGlzZWFzZXM._12-qzw}

Modern modes of transportation allow more people and products to travel
around the world at a faster pace. They also open the airways to the
transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors. One example of
this occurring is **West Nile Virus** , which scientists believe was
introduced to the United States by an infected air traveler. With the
use of air travel, people are able to go to foreign lands, contract a
disease and not have any symptoms of illness until they get home,
possibly exposing others to the disease along the way. See *Virus
Crisis* at
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91b3MCAlYSI](watch?v=91b3MCAlYSI) for
additional information.

Often, new diseases result from the spread of an existing disease from
animals to humans. A disease that can be spread from animals to humans
is called a **zoonosis** . When a disease breaks out, scientists called
**epidemiologists** investigate the outbreak, looking for its cause.
Epidemiologists are like detectives trying to solve a crime. The
information epidemiologists learn is important to understand the
pathogen, and help prevent future outbreaks of disease.

A deadly strain of avian flu virus named H5N1 has posed the greatest
risk for a new influenza pandemic since it first killed humans in Asia
in the 1990s. The virus is passed from infected birds to humans.
Fortunately, the virus has not mutated to a form that spreads easily
between people.

Several lethal viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever have been
discovered, two of which are shown in the **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMy0xMw..) . Ebola outbreaks have been
limited mainly to remote areas of the world. However, they have gained
extensive media attention because of the high mortality rate—23 percent
to 90 percent—depending on the strain. The primary hosts of the viruses
are thought to be apes in west central Africa, but the virus has also
been isolated from bats in the same region.

</div>

People get exposed to new and rare zoonoses when they move into new
areas and encounter wild animals. For example, severe acute respiratory
syndrome ( **SARS** ) is a respiratory disease which is caused by the
SARS coronavirus. An outbreak in China in 2003 was linked to the
handling and consumption of wild civet cats sold as food in a market. In
2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in
Chinese bats. It is likely that the virus spread from bats to civets,
and then to humans.

##### Ebola {#8.html#x-ck12-RWJvbGE._12-pcy}

Ebola is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with a strain of
Ebola virus. The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history,
affecting multiple countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Sierra
Leone and Liberia. Ebola is spread through direct contact with blood and
body fluids of a person infected by and already showing symptoms of
Ebola. Ebola is not spread through the air, water, food, or mosquitoes.
See *Ebola virus disease* at
[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/]() for additional
information.

### Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-987}

**Why is the shape of the virus important?**

The AIDS virus. One of the most troublesome viruses known. Why? Notice
the intricate anatomy of the virus, both inside and outside. It is the
constant changing of those outside markers that make producing a vaccine
against this virus difficult.

### HIV {#8.html#x-ck12-SElW_13-r26}

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( **HIV** ) is the virus that causes
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( **AIDS** ). Most researchers
believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th
century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with
infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal
secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a
**pandemic** , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now
living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed
more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For
further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention) web site at
[http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/]() .

HIV is the retrovirus that destroys the immune system. HIV primarily
infects helper T cells (specifically CD4 ^+^ T cells), macrophages, and
dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 ^+^ T cells
because the virus directly kills infected cells and the infected T cells
are also attacked by the immune system. The infection of a CD4 cell is
shown in the **Figure** [below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMy0xMg..) .
When CD4 ^+^ T cell numbers decline below a certain critical level,
cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes more prone to
opportunistic infections. HIV infections will be discussed further in
the immune system concepts.

If left untreated, most HIV-infected individuals will develop AIDS. AIDS
is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the damage to
the immune system by HIV. Because the immune systems of people with AIDS
are so weak, bacteria and viruses that do not normally cause disease in
healthy people can easily cause disease in an AIDS patient.
Opportunistic infections associated with AIDS include:

-   **Pneumocystis pneumonia** : a form of pneumonia caused by a fungus.
-   Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the *Mycobacterium
    tuberculosis* bacteria.
-   Lung infections caused by Mycobacterium other than
    tuberculosis (MOTT).
-   **Kaposi's sarcoma** : a type of cancer that is caused by Kaposi's
    sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

</div>

#### An HIV Infection {#8.html#x-ck12-QW4gSElWIEluZmVjdGlvbg.._13-qna}

An HIV infection of a CD4 cell can be summarized as follows:

1.  First, the viral particle attaches to the CD4 receptor and other
    associated receptors on the cell membrane. The viral envelope then
    fuses with the cell membrane, and the viral capsid moves into
    the cell.
2.  Once the viral capsid enters the cell, reverse transcriptase frees
    the single-stranded RNA from the viral proteins and copies it into a
    complementary strand of DNA. This process of reverse transcription
    is error-prone and it is during this step that mutations may occur.
    Such mutations may cause drug resistance.
3.  The reverse transcriptase then makes a complementary DNA strand to
    form a double-stranded viral DNA (vDNA).
4.  The vDNA is then moved into the cell nucleus. The integration of the
    viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another
    viral enzyme called **integrase** . This integrated viral DNA may
    then lie dormant, during the latent stage of the HIV infection.
    Clinical latency for HIV can vary between two weeks and 20 years.
5.  To actively produce viruses, certain cellular transcription factors
    need to be present. These transcription factors are plentiful in
    activated T cells. This means that those cells most likely to be
    killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection. The virus DNA
    is transcribed to mRNA which then leads to new virus protein and
    genome production.
6.  Viral particles are assembled inside the cell and then exit the cell
    by budding. The virus gets its viral envelope from the cell’s
    plasma membrane. The cycle begins again when the new particles
    infect another cell.

HIV infection is treated with a cocktail of several antiretroviral
drugs. The **antiretroviral drugs** prevent the virus from replicating
and destroying more T cells, thus preventing the patients from
developing AIDS. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can dramatically
increase the life expectancy of people with HIV.

**What's the best part of going to the doctor?**

Most people don't like having a shot at the doctor's office. But these
are necessary. They protect you from some very dangerous viruses.

### Control of Viruses {#8.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbCBvZiBWaXJ1c2Vz_14-6of}

People have been able to control the spread of viruses even before they
knew they existed. In 1717, Mary Montagu, the wife of an English
ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, observed local women inoculating their
children against smallpox, a contagious viral disease that was often
deadly. **Inoculation** involves introducing a small amount of virus
into a person’s body to allow their body to build up immunity to the
virus. This early smallpox inoculation involved putting smallpox crusts
into the nostril of a healthy person.

#### Vaccines {#8.html#x-ck12-VmFjY2luZXM._14-lep}

Because viruses use the machinery of a host cell to reproduce and stay
within them, they are difficult to get rid of without killing the host
cell. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the
discovery of viruses. A **vaccine** is a mixture of antigenic material
and other immune stimulants that will produce immunity to a certain
pathogen or disease. The term "vaccine" comes from Edward Jenner's use
of cowpox ( *vacca* means cow in Latin), to immunize people against
smallpox.

The material in the vaccine can either be weakened forms of a living
pathogen or virus, dead pathogens (or inactivated viruses), purified
material such as viral proteins, or genetically engineered pieces of a
pathogen. The material in the vaccine will cause the body to mount an
immune response, so the person will develop **immunity** to the disease.
Smallpox was the first disease people tried to prevent by purposely
inoculating themselves with other types of infections such as cowpox.
**Vaccination** is an effective way of preventing viral infections.
Vaccinations can be given in schools, shown in the **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMy0xNQ..) , health clinics, and even
at home. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity
(illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as
polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Genetically engineered vaccines are
produced through recombinant DNA technology. Most new vaccines are
produced with this technology.

A worldwide vaccination campaign by the World Health Organization led to
the eradication of smallpox in 1979. Smallpox is a contagious disease
unique to humans and is caused by two *Variola* viruses. The eradication
of smallpox was possible because humans are the only carriers of the
virus. To this day, smallpox is the only human infectious disease to
have been completely eradicated from nature. Scientists are hoping to
eradicate polio next.

#### Antiviral Drugs {#8.html#x-ck12-QW50aXZpcmFsIERydWdz_14-lwq}

While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by
vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral
drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development.
**Antiviral drugs** are medications used specifically for treating the
symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was
**interferon** , a substance that is naturally produced by certain
immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years
the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral
therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS
epidemic.

Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses.
They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to
treat infections. Most of the antiviral drugs now available are designed
to help deal with HIV and herpes viruses. Antivirals are also available
for the influenza viruses and the Hepatitis B and C viruses, which can
cause liver cancer.

Antiviral drugs are often imitation DNA building blocks which viruses
incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life cycle of the
virus is then halted because the newly synthesized DNA is inactive.
Similar to antibiotics, antivirals are subject to drug resistance as the
pathogens evolve to survive exposure to the treatment. HIV evades the
immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the
proteins on the surface of the virion. Researchers are now working to
extend the range of antivirals to other families of **pathogens** .

**Can viruses be helpful, or just harmful?**

Viruses are extensively used in research and medicine to both understand
basic biology and to improve human health. Imagine having a tool that is
able to inject its DNA into a host cell. The possibilities of using such
a tool are endless. That tool would be a virus.

### Viruses in Research {#8.html#x-ck12-VmlydXNlcyBpbiBSZXNlYXJjaA.._15-r8q}

Viruses are an extremely important tool in the study of molecular and
cellular biology. Since viruses infect cells by moving their genetic
material into the host cell's nucleus, they are helpful in the
investigation of the functions of cells. For example, the use of viruses
in research has helped our understanding of the basics of molecular
genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing,
translation, protein transport, and immunology.

#### Viruses and Medicine {#8.html#x-ck12-VmlydXNlcyBhbmQgTWVkaWNpbmU._15-cat}

Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells
that they are studying. A **viral vector** is a tool commonly used by
molecular biologists to place genetic material into cells. To be a
useful viral vector, the virus is modified so that it will not cause
disease, and it will infect only certain types of cells. **Phages** are
often used as vectors to genetically modify bacteria.

In a similar fashion, **viral therapy** uses viruses to genetically
modify diseased cells and tissues. Viral therapy shows promise as a
method of **gene therapy** and in the treatment of cancer. Gene therapy
is the insertion of genes into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a
disease. In the case of a genetic disease, the defective gene is
replaced with a working gene. Although the technology is still new, it
has been used with some success.

Scientists have focused on gene therapy for diseases caused by
single-gene defects, such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, muscular
dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. In gene therapy, the correct version
of the gene is introduced to human cells by using a viral vector such as
the adenovirus shown in the **Figure**
[below](#8.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMTkwMy0xNg..) .

Phages have been used for over 60 years as an alternative to antibiotics
in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They are seen as a hope
against multi-drug-resistant strains of many bacteria because they can
infect and kill these “superbugs”. However, in the case of MRSA
(Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* ), a phage infecting the
bacterium produces a toxin that makes the bacterium more virulent and
difficult to contain.

Viruses that infect cancer cells are being studied for their use in
cancer treatments. **Oncolytic viruses** are viruses that lyse and kill
cancer cells. Some researchers are hoping to treat some cancers with
these viruses.

## Summary {#8.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-xjm}

Prokaryotes and Viruses discusses prokaryotes and viruses. Prokaryotes
are the smallest living organisms, and viruses, by the definition of
"living," are not actually alive. Both can be harmful, but we need
bacteria to survive, and the uniqueness of viruses has made them a very
useful tool to improve the human condition.

**Would you eat this mushroom?**

Now that's an interesting mushroom! In fact, fungi can be some of the
most colorful species. And protists can be some of the most interesting.
These two kingdoms which have some of the most diverse members are the
first two eukaryotic kingdoms we discuss in the *Protists and Fungi*
chapter.

This quintessential toadstool, the fly agaric or fly Amanita, is a
poisonous and psychoactive fungus. It has a large white-gilled,
white-spotted, usually deep red mushroom, and it is one of the most
recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture. You should not
eat it.

**Prokaryote or eukaryote?**

This organism consists of a single cell with several flagella. Is it a
prokaryote, such as a bacterium? Actually, it’s larger than a
prokaryotic cell, and it also has a nucleus. Therefore, this organism
belongs to the domain Eukarya, the domain that includes humans. This
particular eukaryote is one of the smallest, simplest organisms in the
domain, called a protist. It’s scientific name is *Giardia lamblia.* As
a human parasite, it can make us sick.

### Kingdom Protista {#9.html#x-ck12-S2luZ2RvbSBQcm90aXN0YQ..-eij}

Protists are a group of all the eukaryotes that are not fungi, animals,
or plants. As a result, it is a very diverse group of organisms. The
eukaryotes that make up this kingdom, Kingdom **Protista** , do not have
much in common besides a relatively simple organization. Protists can
look very different from each other. Some are tiny and unicellular, like
an **amoeba** , and some are large and multicellular, like **seaweed** .
However, multicellular protists do not have highly specialized tissues
or organs. This simple cellular-level organization distinguishes
protists from other eukaryotes, such as fungi, animals, and plants.
There are thought to be between 60,000 and 200,000 protist species, and
many have yet to be identified. Protists live in almost any environment
that contains liquid water. Many protists, such as the **algae** , are
photosynthetic and are vital primary producers in ecosystems. Other
protists are responsible for a range of serious human diseases, such as
**malaria** and sleeping sickness.

The term protista was first used by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. Protists were
traditionally placed into one of several groups based on similarities to
a plant, animal, or fungus: the animal-like **protozoa** , the
plant-like **protophyta** (mostly algae), and the fungus-like **slime
molds** and **water molds** . These traditional subdivisions, which were
largely based on non-scientific characteristics, have been replaced by
classifications based on **phylogenetics** (evolutionary relatedness
among organisms). However, the older terms are still used as informal
names to describe the general characteristics of various protists.

**What's the difference between a bacterium and a simple protist?**

Were simple protists the first eukaryotic organisms to evolve? Probably.
A protist is a eukaryote, so each cell has a nucleus. Otherwise, simple
protists, like the Paramecium and amoeba, can be fairly similar to
bacteria.

### Evolution of Protists {#9.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFByb3Rpc3Rz_1-bij}

Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they
must have evolved from prokaryotic cells. How did this happen? The
**endosymbiotic theory** provides the most widely-accepted explanation.
That’s because it is well supported by evidence.

#### The First Eukaryotic Cells {#9.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEZpcnN0IEV1a2FyeW90aWMgQ2VsbHM._1-ffu}

According to the endosymbiotic theory, the first eukaryotic cells
evolved from a **symbiotic relationship** between two or more
prokaryotic cells. Smaller prokaryotic cells were engulfed by (or
invaded) larger prokaryotic cells. The small cells (now called
**endosymbionts** ) benefited from the relationship by getting a safe
home and nutrients. The large cells (now called **hosts** ) benefited by
getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the
endosymbionts. Eventually, the endosymbionts evolved into **organelles**
of the host cells. After that, neither could live without the other.

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTAyLWVuZG9zeW1iaW90aWMtdGhlb3J5) , some
of the endosymbionts were aerobic bacteria. They were specialized to
break down chemicals and release energy. They evolved into the
mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Some of the small cells were
cyanobacteria. They were specialized for photosynthesis. They evolved
into the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells.

Endosymbiotic theory explains how eukaryotic cells arose.

</div>

#### Evidence for the Endosymbiotic Theory {#9.html#x-ck12-RXZpZGVuY2UgZm9yIHRoZSBFbmRvc3ltYmlvdGljIFRoZW9yeQ.._1-qty}

Many pieces of evidence support the endosymbiotic theory. For example:

-   Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA that is different from the
    DNA found in the cell nucleus. Instead, it is similar to the
    circular DNA of bacteria.
-   Mitochondria and chloroplasts are surrounded by their own plasma
    membranes, which are similar to bacterial membranes.
-   New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process
    similar to **binary fission** . Bacteria also reproduce through
    binary fission.
-   The internal structure and biochemistry of chloroplasts is very
    similar to that of cyanobacteria.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-s4o}

-   Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes.
-   Protists most likely evolved from prokaryotic cells, as explained by
    the endosymbiotic theory. This theory is well-supported by evidence.

**Sexual or asexual reproduction for protists?**

Notice how the Paramecium is dividing into two cells. This, obviously,
is a form of asexual reproduction. But, remember that protists are an
extremely diverse kingdom, and some protists can also reproduce
sexually.

### Characteristics of Protists {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFByb3Rpc3Rz_2-ejo}

Like all other eukaryotes, protists have a nucleus containing their DNA.
They also have other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria and
the endoplasmic reticulum. Most protists are single-celled. Some are
multicellular. Because the protist kingdom is so diverse, their ways of
getting food and reproducing vary widely.

#### Protist Habitats {#9.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGlzdCBIYWJpdGF0cw.._2-fgj}

Most protists are aquatic organisms. They need a moist environment to
survive. They are found mainly in damp soil, marshes, puddles, lakes,
and the ocean. Some protists are free-living organisms. Others are
involved in **symbiotic** relationships. They live in or on other
organisms, including humans.

#### Motility of Protists {#9.html#x-ck12-TW90aWxpdHkgb2YgUHJvdGlzdHM._2-ck6}

Most protists have **motility** . This is the ability to move. Protists
have three types of appendages for movement. As shown in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTAzLXByb3Rpc3QtbW90aWxpdHk.) , they may
have **flagella, cilia** , or **pseudopods** (“false feet”). There may
be one or more whip-like flagella. Cilia are similar to flagella, except
they are shorter and there are more of them. They may completely cover
the surface of the protist cell. Pseudopods are temporary, foot-like
extensions of the cytoplasm.

Protists use cilia, pseudopods, or flagella to move.

</div>

#### Protist Reproduction {#9.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGlzdCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._2-ofr}

Protists have complex life cycles. Many have both asexual and sexual
reproduction. An example is a protist called *Spirogyra* , a type of
algae, shown **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTA0LXNwaXJvZ3lyYQ..) . It usually exists
as haploid cells that reproduce by binary fission. In a stressful
environment, such as one that is very dry, *Spirogyra* may produce tough
spores that can withstand harsh conditions. **Spores** are reproductive
cells produced by protists and various other organisms. If two protist
spores are close together, they can fuse to form a diploid zygote. This
is a type of sexual reproduction. The zygote then undergoes meiosis,
producing haploid cells that repeat the cycle.

*Spirogyra* is a genus of algae with a complex life cycle. Each organism
consists of rectangular cells connected end-to-end in long filaments.

</div>

#### Protist Nutrition {#9.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGlzdCBOdXRyaXRpb24._2-hau}

Protists get food in one of three ways. They may ingest, absorb, or make
their own organic molecules.

-   Ingestive protists ingest, or engulf, bacteria and other
    small particles. They extend their cell wall and cell membrane
    around the food item, forming a food **vacuole** . Then enzymes
    digest the food in the vacuole.
-   Absorptive protists absorb food molecules across their
    cell membranes. This occurs by **diffusion** . These protists are
    important decomposers.
-   Photosynthetic protists use light energy to make food. They are
    major producers in aquatic ecosystems.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-ehe}

-   Protists have nuclear membranes around their DNA. They also have
    other membrane-bound organelles.
-   Many protists live in aquatic habitats, and most are motile, or able
    to move.
-   Protists have complex life cycles that may include both sexual and
    asexual reproduction.
-   Protists get food through ingestion, absorption, or photosynthesis.

**What's like an animal, but not an animal?**

An animal-like protist, or a protozoa. These protists have the ability
to move, usually with some sort of cilia or flagella, and must obtain
their energy from other sources. But obviously, they are much simpler
than animals.

### Animal-Like Protists: Protozoa {#9.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsLUxpa2UgUHJvdGlzdHM6IFByb3Rvem9h_3-54d}

Animal-like protists are commonly called **protozoa** (singular,
protozoan). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. They are animal-like
because they are heterotrophs, and are capable of moving. Although
protozoa are not animals, they are thought to be the ancestors of
animals.

#### Ecology of Protozoa {#9.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBQcm90b3pvYQ.._3-e7p}

Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As
consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are
predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as
bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations
under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still
others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also
parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the
protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are
also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects
and worms.

#### Classification of Protozoa {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgUHJvdG96b2E._3-sqb}

Protozoa can be classified on the basis of how they move. As shown in
**Table** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cHJvdG96b2EtbW92ZW1lbnQ.) ,
protozoa move in three different ways. Only sporozoa cannot move. Note
that this classification is based only on differences in movement. It
does not represent phylogenetic relationships.

**Many people, if not most, believe seaweed to be a plant. Is it?**

Seaweed is actually a plant-like protist, which are also known as algae.
The green color is due to what pigment? Algae, like plants, obtain their
energy through photosynthesis.

### Plant-Like Protists: Algae {#9.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQtTGlrZSBQcm90aXN0czogQWxnYWU._4-xgv}

Plant-like protists are called **algae** (singular, alga). They are a
large and diverse group. Some algae, the **diatoms** , are
single-celled. Others, such as **seaweed** , are multicellular (see
**Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTA1LWRpYXRvbXMtc2Vhd2VlZC1jb21wb3NpdGU.)
).

**Figure 9.5**

Diatoms are single-celled algae. Other forms of algae are multicellular.

</div>

Why are algae considered plant-like? The main reason is that they
contain **chloroplasts** and produce food through **photosynthesis** .
However, they lack many other structures of true plants. For example,
algae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. Some algae also differ from
plants in being motile. They may move with pseudopods or flagella.
Although not plants themselves, algae were probably the ancestors of
plants.

#### Ecology of Algae {#9.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBBbGdhZQ.._4-qlz}

Algae play significant roles as producers in aquatic ecosystems.
Microscopic forms live suspended in the water column. They are the main
component of **phytoplankton** . As such, they contribute to the food
base of most marine ecosystems.

Multicellular seaweeds called **kelp** may grow as large as trees. They
are the food base of ecosystems called **kelp forests** (see **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTA2LWtlbHAtZm9yZXN0) ). Kelp forests are
found throughout the ocean in temperate and arctic climates. They are
highly productive ecosystems.

</div>

#### Classification of Algae {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQWxnYWU._4-2so}

Types of algae include red and green algae, and **euglenids** , and
**dinoflagellates** (see **Table**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dHlwZXMtb2YtYWxnYWU.) for examples).
Scientists think that red and green algae evolved from endosymbiotic
relationships with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts have two membranes
because the cell membranes of the cyanobacteria became additional plasma
membranes of the chloroplasts. Scientists think that euglenids and
dinoflagellates evolved later, from endosymbiotic relationships with
green and red algae. This is why their chloroplasts have three
membranes. Differences in the types of chlorophyll in the four types of
algae also support the hypothesized evolutionary relationships.

#### Reproduction of Algae {#9.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIG9mIEFsZ2Fl_4-xqc}

Algae have varied life cycles. Two examples are shown in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTA3LWFsZ2FsLWxpZmUtY3ljbGVz) . Both
cycles include phases of asexual reproduction (haploid, *n* ) and sexual
reproduction (diploid, *2n* ). Why go to so much trouble to reproduce?
Asexual reproduction is fast, but it doesn’t create new genetic
variation. Sexual reproduction is more complicated and risky, but it
creates new gene combinations. Each strategy may work better under
different conditions. Rapid population growth (asexual reproduction) is
adaptive when conditions are favorable. Genetic variation (sexual
reproduction) helps ensure that some organisms will survive if the
environment changes.

**What grows just about anywhere there is decaying material?**

Mold. This slime mold, shown growing on dead wood, is a fungus-like
protist. Though this mold does not have a mouth, essentially it is still
“eating” this decaying material.

### Fungus-Like Protists: Molds {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ3VzLUxpa2UgUHJvdGlzdHM6IE1vbGRz_5-b35}

Fungus-like protists are **molds** . They are absorptive feeders on
decaying organic matter. They resemble fungi, and they reproduce with
**spores** as fungi do. However, in other ways, they are quite different
from fungi and more like other protists. For example, they have cell
walls made of **cellulose** , whereas fungi have cell walls made of
chitin. Like other protists, they have complicated life cycles with both
asexual and sexual reproduction. They are motile during some stages of
their life cycle. Two major types of fungus-like protists are slime
molds and water molds.

#### Slime Molds {#9.html#x-ck12-U2xpbWUgTW9sZHM._5-r1r}

**Slime molds** are fungus-like protists commonly found on rotting logs
and compost. They move very slowly in search of decaying matter to eat.
When food is scarce, individual cells swarm together to form a blob-like
mass, like the “dog vomit” slime mold in the **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTA4LXNsaW1lLW1vbGQ.) . The mass glides
along on its own secretions, engulfing decaying organic matter as it
moves over it.

</div>

There are two types of slime molds when it comes to how they swarm:
acellular and cellular.

-   When acellular slime molds swarm, they fuse together to form a
    single cell with many nuclei.
-   When cellular slime molds swarm, they remain as distinct cells.

Cellular slime molds are used as model organisms in molecular biology
and genetics. They may be the key to how multicellular organisms
evolved. Can you explain why?

#### Water Molds {#9.html#x-ck12-V2F0ZXIgTW9sZHM._5-c7x}

**Water molds** are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many
are plant pathogens that destroy crops. They infect plants such as
grapes, lettuce, corn, and potatoes. Some water molds are parasites of
fish and other aquatic organisms.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-5qp}

**Can such little creatures make you sick?**

They sure can. Not all of them, but some of them. And without proper
medical treatment, the person may never recover.

### Protists and Human Disease {#9.html#x-ck12-UHJvdGlzdHMgYW5kIEh1bWFuIERpc2Vhc2U._6-kt5}

Most protist diseases in humans are caused by animal-like protists, or
**protozoa** . Protozoa make us sick when they become human
**parasites** . Three examples of parasitic protozoa are described
below.

#### *Trypanosoma* Protozoa {#9.html#x-ck12-Ym90dHlqZzZtYw.._6-hyb}

Members of the genus *Trypanosoma* are flagellate protozoa that cause
**sleeping sickness** , which is common in Africa. They also cause
**Chagas disease** , which is common in South America. The parasites are
spread by insect vectors. The vector for Chagas disease is shown in
**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTIzLXZlY3Rvci1mb3ItQ2hhZ2Fz)
. *Trypanosoma* parasites enter a person’s blood when the vector bites.
Then they spread to other tissues and organs. The diseases may be fatal
without medical treatment.

**Figure 9.9**

Vector for Chagas Disease. In Chagas disease, the Trypanosoma parasite
is spread by an insect commonly called the “kissing bug.” A bite from
this bug could be the kiss of death.

</div>

The discovery of Chagas disease is unique in the history of medicine.
That’s because a single researcher—a Brazilian physician named Carlos
Chagas—single-handedly identified and explained the new infectious
disease. In the early 1900s, Chagas did careful lab and field studies.
He determined the pathogen, vector, host, symptoms, and mode of
transmission of the disease that is now named for him.

#### *Giardia* Protozoa {#9.html#x-ck12-dDZkbXd4YXkyZg.._6-ik6}

*Giardia* are flagellate protozoa that cause **giardiasis** . The
parasites enter the body through food or water that has been
contaminated by feces of infected people or animals. The protozoa attach
to the lining of the host’s small intestine, where they prevent the host
from fully absorbing nutrients. They may also cause diarrhea, abdominal
pain, and fever. A picture of a *Giardia* protozoan opens this concept.

#### *Plasmodium* Protozoa {#9.html#x-ck12-aXhrdWFxNGR3dg.._6-ovw}

*Plasmodium* protozoa cause **malaria** . The parasites are spread by a
mosquito vector. Parasites enter a host’s blood through the bite of an
infected mosquito. The parasites infect the host’s red blood cells,
causing symptoms such as fever, joint pain, anemia, and fatigue.

Malaria is common in tropical and subtropical climates throughout the
world (see **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTI0LW1hbGFyaWEtbWFw) ). In fact, malaria
is one of the most common infectious diseases on the planet. Malaria is
also a very serious disease. It kills several million people each year,
most of them children. A vaccine to malaria is a possibility. See

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._6-325}

-   Most protist diseases in humans are caused by protozoa. Protozoa
    make humans sick when they become human parasites.
-   *Trypanosoma* protozoa cause Chagas disease and sleeping sickness.
-   *Giardia* protozoa cause giardiasis, and *Plasmodium* protozoa
    cause malaria.

**What exactly is a fungus?**

They're not animals or plants, and definitely not protists. So they
cannot photosynthesize or eat. And they are much more than mushrooms.

### Characteristics of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEZ1bmdp_7-tia}

Do you see the organisms growing on the bread in the **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTEwLWJyZWFkLW1vbGQ.) ? They belong to
the Kingdom **Fungi** . **Molds** growing on foods are some of the most
common fungi in our everyday lives. These organisms may seem useless,
gross, and costly. But fungi play very important roles in almost every
terrestrial ecosystem on Earth.

Fungi (singular, fungus) are a kingdom in the domain Eukarya. The fungi
kingdom may contain more than a million species, but fewer than 100,000
have been identified. As shown in the **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTExLWZ1bmdpLWV4YW1wbGVz) , fungi include
mushrooms and yeasts in addition to molds.

**Figure 9.12**

Several examples of fungi are pictured here.

</div>

Most fungi are multicellular, but some exist as single cells.
Single-celled fungi are known as **yeasts.** Fungi spend most of their
life cycle in the haploid state. They form diploid cells only during
sexual reproduction. Like the cells of protists and plants, the cells of
fungi have cell walls. But fungi are unique in having cell walls made of
chitin instead of cellulose. **Chitin** is a tough carbohydrate that
also makes up the exoskeleton (outer skeleton) of insects and related
organisms.

#### Habitats of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-SGFiaXRhdHMgb2YgRnVuZ2k._7-fua}

Fungi are found all around the world, and grow in a wide range of
habitats, including deserts. Most grow in terrestrial environments, but
several species live only in aquatic habitats. Most fungi live in soil
or dead matter, and in symbiotic relationships with plants, animals, or
other fungi. Fungi, along with bacteria that are found in soil, are the
primary decomposers of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems. The
decomposition of dead organisms returns nutrient to the soil, and the
environment.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-dha}

**Is the structure important?**

Of course. Though mushrooms may be the most common type of fungus, fungi
also include rusts, smuts, puffballs, truffles, morels, molds, and
yeasts, as well as many less well-known organisms. And, except for yeast
cells, they all have similar structures, which are usually hidden deep
within their food source.

### Structure of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIEZ1bmdp_8-pnk}

Except for yeasts, which grow as single cells, most fungi grow as
thread-like filaments, like those shown in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTEyLXBlbmNpbGxpdW0taHlwaGFl) . The
filaments are called **hyphae** (singular, hypha). Each hypha consists
of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae
make up the body of a fungus, which is called a **mycelium** (plural,
mycelia).

The hyphae of most fungi are divided into cells by internal walls called
**septa** (singular, septum). Septa usually have little pores that are
large enough to allow ribosomes, mitochondria and sometimes nuclei to
flow among cells. Hyphae that are divided into cells are called
**septate hyphae** . However, the hyphae of some fungi are not separated
by septa. Hyphae without septae are called **coenocytic hyphae** .
Coenocytic hyphae are big, multinucleated cells.

A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact,
one of the largest living organisms on Earth is the mycelium of a single
fungus. A small part of a similar fungus is pictured in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTEzLWh1bW9uZ291cy1mdW5ndXM.) . The giant
fungus covers 8.9 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) in an Oregon
forest. That’s about the size of a small city. The fungus didn’t grow
that large overnight. It’s estimated to be 2,400 years old, and it’s
still growing!

#### Fruiting Bodies {#9.html#x-ck12-RnJ1aXRpbmcgQm9kaWVz_8-hph}

Some fungi become noticeable only when producing spores (fruiting),
either as mushrooms or molds. For example, you can see the fruiting
bodies of the *Armillaria* fungus in the **Figure**
[above](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTEzLWh1bW9uZ291cy1mdW5ndXM.) , but the
large “body” of the fungus, the mycelium, is hidden underground. This
fruiting body, known as the **sporocarp** , is a multicellular structure
on which spore-producing structures form. The fruiting body is part of
the sexual phase of a fungal life cycle. The rest of the life cycle is
characterized by the growth of mycelia.

#### Dimorphic Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-RGltb3JwaGljIEZ1bmdp_8-fxe}

Some fungi take on different shapes, depending on their environmental
conditions. These fungi are called **dimorphic fungi** , because they
have “two forms.” For example, the fungus *Histoplasma capsulatum* ,
which causes the disease histoplasmosis, is thermally dimorphic; it has
two forms that are dependent on temperature. In temperatures of about
25°C, it grows as a brownish mycelium, and looks like a mass of threads.
At body temperature (37°C in humans), it grows as single, round yeast
cells.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-7tk}

**So what do fungi "eat"?**

Just about anything. From dead plants to rotting fruit. Shown here are
fungi sprouting from dead material in the woods. Fungi perform an
essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have
fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange.

### Nutrition {#9.html#x-ck12-TnV0cml0aW9u_9-ezm}

Fungi get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from the
environment. Fungi are **heterotrophic** : they rely solely on carbon
obtained from other organisms for their metabolism and nutrition. Fungi
have evolved in a way that allows many of them to use a large variety of
organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as
nitrate, ammonia, acetate, or ethanol. Their mode of nutrition defines
the role of fungi in their environment.

Fungi obtain nutrients in three different ways:

1.  They decompose dead organic matter. A **saprotroph** is an organism
    that obtains its nutrients from non-living organic matter, usually
    dead and decaying plant or animal matter, by absorbing soluble
    organic compounds. Saprotrophic fungi play very important roles as
    recyclers in ecosystem energy flow and biogeochemical cycles.
    Saprophytic fungi, such as shiitake ( *Lentinula edodes* ) and
    oyster mushrooms ( *Pleurotus ostreatus* ), decompose dead plant and
    animal tissue by releasing enzymes from hyphal tips. In this way
    they recycle organic materials back into the
    surrounding environment. Because of these abilities, fungi are the
    primary decomposers in forests (see **Figure**
    [below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE4LWZvcmVzdC1kZWNvbXBvc2Vycw..) ).
2.  They feed on living hosts. As **parasites** , fungi live in or on
    other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic
    fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes
    illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall
    that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between
    organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits
    from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed.
3.  They live mutualistically with other organisms. Mutualistic fungi
    live harmlessly with other living organisms. Recall that mutualism
    is an interaction between individuals of two different species, in
    which both individuals benefit.

Both parasitism and mutualism are classified as symbiotic relationships,
but they are discussed separately here because of the different effect
on the host.

</div>

Fungal hyphae are adapted to efficient absorption of nutrients from
their environments, because hyphae have high surface area-to-volume
ratios. These adaptations are also complemented by the release of
**hydrolytic enzymes** that break down large organic molecules such as
polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids into smaller molecules. These
molecules are then absorbed as nutrients into the fungal cells. One
enzyme that is secreted by fungi is **cellulase** , which breaks down
the polysaccharide **cellulose** . Cellulose is a major component of
plant cell walls. In some cases, fungi have developed specialized
structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts, which penetrate into
the host cells for nutrient uptake by the fungus.

mycelia. The branching mycelia have a high surface-area-to-volume ratio
which allows for efficient absorption of nutrients. Some fungi digest
nutrients by releasing enzymes into the environment.

</div>

#### Mycorrhiza {#9.html#x-ck12-TXljb3JyaGl6YQ.._9-1ux}

A **mycorrhiza** (Greek for "fungus roots") is a symbiotic association
between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association,
the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing
directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This
association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct
access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The
mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root
system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient
absorption from the soil.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._9-86h}

    organic compounds from the environment.

**How do fungi reproduce? Sexually or asexually?**

How about both? That would suggest that fungi can produce both diploid
and haploid cells, which they can. Shown above are fungi mycelia and
haploid spores. Spores allow fungi to reproduce through unfavorable
conditions.

### Reproduction of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9uIG9mIEZ1bmdp_10-vpg}

The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually. This
allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment. They can spread
quickly through asexual reproduction when conditions are stable. They
can increase their genetic variation through sexual reproduction when
conditions are changing and variation may help them survive.

#### Asexual Reproduction {#9.html#x-ck12-QXNleHVhbCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._10-pij}

Almost all fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores. A fungal
**spore** is a haploid cell produced by mitosis from a haploid parent
cell. It is genetically identical to the parent cell. Fungal spores can
develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized.

Spores may be dispersed by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Some
fungi even have “cannons” that “shoot” the spores far from the parent
organism. This helps to ensure that the offspring will not have to
compete with the parent for space or other resources. You are probably
familiar with puffballs, like the one in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE0LXB1ZmZiYWxscw..) . They release a
cloud of spores when knocked or stepped on. Wherever the spores happen
to land, they do not germinate until conditions are favorable for
growth. Then they develop into new **hyphae** .

**Figure 9.17**

Puffballs release spores when disturbed.

</div>

Yeasts do not produce spores. Instead, they reproduce asexually by
budding. **Budding** is the pinching off of an offspring from the parent
cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent. Budding
in yeast is pictured in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE1LWJ1ZGRpbmc.) .

#### Sexual Reproduction {#9.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._10-faw}

Sexual reproduction also occurs in virtually all fungi. This involves
mating between two haploid hyphae. During mating, two haploid parent
cells fuse, forming a diploid spore called a **zygospore** . The
zygospore is genetically different from the parents. After the zygospore
germinates, it can undergo meiosis, forming haploid cells that develop
into new hyphae.

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-ath}

-   The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually.
    This allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment.
-   Yeast reproduce asexually by budding. Other fungi reproduce
    asexually by producing spores.
-   Sexual reproduction occurs when spores from two parents fuse and
    form a zygospore.

**What were early fungi like?**

Early fungi probably lived in water. And they were most likely
single-celled organisms. Maybe they lived on dead and decaying material.
Obviously, at least in overall size and structure, a mold is very
different than a mushroom. Could early fungi have been similar to a
mold?

### Evolution of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEZ1bmdp_11-ygg}

DNA evidence suggests that almost all **fungi** have a single common
ancestor. The earliest fungi may have evolved about 600 million years
ago or even earlier. They were probably aquatic organisms with a
flagellum. Fungi first colonized the land at least 460 million years
ago, around the same time as plants. Fossils of terrestrial fungi date
back almost 400 million years (see **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE2LWZvc3NpbGl6ZWQtZnVuZ2k.) ). Starting
about 250 million years ago, the fossil record shows fungi were abundant
in many places. They may have been the dominant life forms on Earth at
that time.

**What type of fungus is this?**

Obviously a mold. But what type of mold? There are thousands of known
species of molds. How are they classified?

### Classification of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgRnVuZ2k._12-iny}

For a long time, scientists considered fungi to be members of the plant
kingdom because they have obvious similarities with plants. Both fungi
and plants are immobile, have cell walls, and grow in soil. Some fungi,
such as **lichens** , even look like plants (see **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE3LWxpY2hlbi1tb3Nz) ).

</div>

#### The Kingdom Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEtpbmdkb20gRnVuZ2k._12-g3m}

Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they
have unique physical, chemical, and genetic traits that set them apart
from plants and other eukaryotes. For example, the cell walls of fungi
are made of **chitin** , not cellulose. Also, fungi absorb nutrients
from other organisms, whereas plants make their own food. These are just
a few of the reasons fungi are now placed in their own kingdom.

#### Fungal Phyla {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2FsIFBoeWxh_12-uit}

Classification of fungi below the level of the kingdom is controversial.
There is no single, widely-accepted system of fungal classification.
Most classifications include several phyla (the next major taxon below
the kingdom). Three of the most common phyla are compared in **Table**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZnVuZ2ktcGh5bGE.) .

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-pvq}

-   Fungi used to be classified as plants. Now, they are known to have
    unique traits that set them apart from plants. For example, fungal
    cell walls contain chitin, not cellulose, and fungi absorb food
    rather than make their own.
-   Below the level of the kingdom, classification of fungi
    is controversial.

**Do all fungi feed only on dead organisms?**

Not all. This fungus is a lichen, providing nutrients to the tree. The
lichen gets sugars from the plant. Both benefit from this relationship.

### Symbiotic Relationships of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-U3ltYmlvdGljIFJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMgb2YgRnVuZ2k._13-eto}

Not all fungi feed on dead organisms. Many are involved in symbiotic
relationships, including **parasitism** and **mutualism** .

#### Fungi as Parasites {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgYXMgUGFyYXNpdGVz_13-0yk}

In a parasitic relationship, the parasite benefits while the host is
harmed. Parasitic fungi live in or on other organisms and get their
nutrients from them. Fungi have special structures for penetrating a
host. They also produce enzymes that break down the host’s tissues.

Parasitic fungi often cause illness and may eventually kill their host.
They are the major cause of disease in agricultural plants. Fungi also
parasitize animals, such as the insect pictured in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTE5LXBhcmFzaXRpYy1mdW5ndXM.) . Fungi
even parasitize humans. Did you ever have athelete’s foot? If so, you
were the host of a parasitic fungus.

Cordyceps is shown here growing on its host—a dark brown moth.

</div>

#### Mutualism in Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-TXV0dWFsaXNtIGluIEZ1bmdp_13-1xs}

Fungi have several mutualistic relationships with other organisms. In
mutualism, both organisms benefit from the relationship. Two common
mutualistic relationships involving fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen.

-   A **mycorrhiza** is a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and
    a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plant roots. The fungus
    benefits from the easy access to food made by the plant. The plant
    benefits because the fungus puts out mycelia that help absorb water
    and nutrients. Scientists think that a symbiotic relationship such
    as this may have allowed plants to first colonize the land.
-   A **lichen** is an organism that results from a mutualistic
    relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism. The
    other organism is usually a cyanobacterium or green alga. The fungus
    grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits from
    the constant supply of food produced by the photosynthesizer. The
    photosynthesizer benefits from the water and nutrients absorbed by
    the fungus. **Figure**
    [below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTIwLWxpY2hlbg..) shows lichen
    growing on a rock.

Lichen Growing on Rock. Unlike plants, lichen can grow on bare rocks
because they don’t have roots. That’s why lichens are often pioneer
species in primary ecological succession. How do lichen get water and
nutrients without roots?

</div>

Some fungi have mutualistic relationships with insects. For example:

-   Leafcutter ants grow fungi on beds of leaves in their nests. The
    fungi get a protected place to live. The ants feed the fungi to
    their larvae.
-   Ambrosia beetles bore holes in tree bark and “plant” fungal spores
    in the holes. The holes in the bark give the fungi an ideal place
    to grow. The beetles harvest fungi from their “garden.”

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._13-jgb}

-   Many fungi are involved in symbiotic relationships.
-   Some fungi are parasites. They are specialized to penetrate a host
    and break down the host’s tissues. Parasitic fungi often cause
    illness and may eventually kill their host.
-   Two common mutualistic relationships involving fungi are mycorrhiza
    (fungi and plant roots) and lichen (fungi and either cyanobacteria
    or green algae).
-   Some fungi also have mutualistic relationships with insects.

#### Fungi for Food {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgZm9yIEZvb2Q._14-mac}

Humans have collected and grown **mushrooms** for food for thousands of
years. **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTIxLWVkaWJsZS1tdXNocm9vbXM.) shows some
of the many types of mushrooms that people eat. Yeasts are used in bread
baking and brewing alcoholic beverages. Other fungi are used in
fermenting a wide variety of foods, including soy sauce, tempeh, and
cheeses. Blue cheese has its distinctive appearance and flavor because
of the fungus growing though it (see **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTIyLWJsdWUtY2hlZXNl) ).

#### Fungi for Pest Control {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgZm9yIFBlc3QgQ29udHJvbA.._14-i7h}

Harmless fungi can be used to control pathogenic bacteria and insect
pests on crops. Fungi compete with bacteria for nutrients and space, and
they parasitize insects that eat plants. Fungi reduce the need for
pesticides and other toxic chemicals.

#### Other Uses of Fungi {#9.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgVXNlcyBvZiBGdW5naQ.._14-sul}

Fungi are useful for many other reasons.

-   They are a major source of citric acid (vitamin C).
-   They produce antibiotics such as **penicillin** , which has saved
    countless lives.
-   They can be genetically engineered to produce insulin and other
    human hormones.
-   They are model research organisms. To see how one lab is using yeast
    in cancer research, watch the video, *Yeast Unleashed,* at this
    link: [http://college.usc.edu/news/stories/727/yeast-unleashed/]() .

### Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-hyl}

-   Humans use fungi for many purposes, including as food or in the
    preparation of food.
-   Humans also use fungi for pest control.
-   In addition, fungi can be used to produce citric acid, antibiotics,
    and human hormones.

**Would you eat these mushrooms?**

I would not recommend it. But certain red mushrooms, *Ganoderma Lucidum*
, have been found to be good for you. Red Mushrooms comprise a family of
more than 200 mushroom species, which are good for our health. Of these,
6 species have a particularly high therapeutic effect.

### Fungi and Human Disease {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2kgYW5kIEh1bWFuIERpc2Vhc2U._15-mpt}

Fungi cause human illness in three different ways: poisonings, parasitic
infections, and allergic reactions. *Science on the SPOT: Fungus Fair*
explores some of these dangerous but also tasty and weirdly wonderful
fungi. See
[http://science.kqed.org/quest/video/science-on-the-spot-fungus-fair/]()
for details.

#### Fungal Poisoning {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2FsIFBvaXNvbmluZw.._15-w9b}

Many fungi protect themselves from parasites and predators by producing
toxic chemicals. If people eat toxic fungi, they may experience
digestive problems, hallucinations, organ failure, and even death. Most
cases of mushroom poisoning are due to mistaken identity. That’s because
many toxic mushrooms look very similar to safe, edible mushrooms. An
example is shown in **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTI1LXBvaXNvbm91cy1lZGlibGUtZnVuZ2k.) .

#### Fungal Parasites {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2FsIFBhcmFzaXRlcw.._15-xws}

Some fungi cause disease when they become human parasites. Two examples
are fungi in the genera *Candida* and *Trichophyton.*

-   *Candida* are yeast that cause **candidiasis** , commonly called a
    “yeast infection.” The yeast can infect the mouth or the vagina. If
    yeast enter the blood, they cause a potentially life
    threatening illness. However, this is rare, except in people with a
    depressed immune system.
-   *Trichophyton* are fungi that cause **ringworm** . This is a skin
    infection characterized by a ring-shaped rash. The rash may occur on
    the arms, legs, head, neck, or trunk. The same fungi cause
    **athlete’s foot** when they infect the skin between the toes.
    Athlete’s foot is the second most common skin disease in the U.S.

**Figure** [below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTI2LXJpbmd3b3Jt) shows signs
of these two infections.

#### Fungal Allergies {#9.html#x-ck12-RnVuZ2FsIEFsbGVyZ2llcw.._15-kcl}

**Mold allergies** are very common. They are caused by airborne mold
spores. When the spores enter the respiratory tract, the immune system
responds to them as though they were harmful microbes. Symptoms may
include sneezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms are
likely to be more severe in people with asthma or other respiratory
diseases. Long-term exposure to mold spores may also weaken the immune
system.

Molds grow indoors as well as out. Indoors, they grow in showers,
basements, and other damp places. Homes damaged in floods and hurricanes
may have mold growing just about everywhere (see **Figure**
[below](#9.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE0LTI3LWluZG9vci1tb2xk) ). Indoor mold may
cause more health problems than outdoor mold because of the closed,
confined space. Most people also spend more time indoors than out.

## Summary {#9.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-yci}

Protists and Fungi discusses these two types of eukaryotic organisms.
What do they have in common? Protists are the earliest eukaryotes, and
this kingdom contains some of the simplest eukaryotes. Many are
single-celled organisms. Protists consist of animal-like, plant-like,
and fungus-like species. Protists evolved into the other three types of
eukaryotes, including fungi. Other than that, these two types of
eukaryotes are very different. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that
cannot make their own food and do not "eat." They must absorb their
nutrients, usually from decaying organisms.

**What are Plants?**

Autumn. A time when leaves turn amazing colors. Of course, leaves are
part of plants. But what are plants? What separates a plant from a
fungus or protist? Or animal?

### Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnRz-4m2}

Imagine that human life cycles resembled those of the earliest plants.
If you think about this analogy, you may begin to realize that many
plants, which appear so inert to our roving eyes and active minds,
actually lead secret lives of surprising variety.

You know that humans develop, or gradually change, from infants to quite
different, sexually mature adults. You also know that meiosis in your
own ovaries or testes produces haploid eggs or sperm, which must join in
fertilization to become a new individual. Each of us, of course, began
as that single cell made when a sperm united with an egg. Now, through
mitosis and the miracle of development, we are made of trillions of
cells organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems, which make us
complex, amazing, active, individual beings. None of us would doubt that
we have changed significantly since we began as single cells. Each of us
has a unique identity that we keep throughout our entire lives, until
death marks our end. We may give birth to other individuals by producing
eggs or sperm, but only if they join with other sperm or eggs to produce
new, separate lives.

If, however, we lived like some plants, your father would not have
produced the sperm cell destined to provide half of your genes, although
there would be such a sperm cell. Your mother would not have produced
the egg cell destined to produce the other half. In fact, your parents,
and you, would not be distinguishable as male or female. Instead, both
parents (or maybe just one parent) would have released thousands of
haploid spore cells, each of which would grow, by mitosis, into a new
individual being, entirely different in form and habitat from its
parents - and you. Small spores would become males, and large spores
females, but as if sperm and egg had decided to postpone their
“marriage” and grow up on their own, these beings would live very
different, “non-human” lives.

Who are these beings? You are certainly not one of them, because you
begin only when egg meets sperm. Their differences from you would be far
greater than the differences between tadpole and frog, or caterpillar
and butterfly, because every individual butterfly or frog could
(theoretically) identify exactly which individual caterpillar or tadpole
it used to be. Not so with these haploid creatures.

At some time during their relatively long lives, the male and female
beings would produce sperm cells and egg cells by mitosis. Fertilization
would not involve mating, of course. Depending on which kind of plant we
chose as our model, sperm might swim on their own (with two or more
flagella) from male to female being, or they might be blown by the wind,
or carried by an animal. After sperm and egg join, you would begin your
life as a single cell, and grow into an “adult,” eventually producing
your own haploid spores. But you would never be able to identify your
parents – if indeed you had two – nor would you know your children,
because entire haploid lives would separate you. Why do plants lead such
complex, multiple lives?

Most of the plants you are probably familiar with produce flowers.
However, plants existed for hundreds of millions of years before they
evolved flowers. In fact, the earliest plants were different from most
modern plants in several important ways. They not only lacked flowers,
but also lacked leaves, roots, and stems. You might not even recognize
them as plants. So why are the earliest plants placed in the plant
kingdom? What traits define a plant?

#### What are Plants? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBhcmUgUGxhbnRzPw..-jla}

Plants are multicellular eukaryotic organisms with **cell walls** made
of **cellulose** . Plant cells also have **chloroplasts** . In addition,
plants have specialized reproductive organs. These are structures that
produce reproductive cells. Male reproductive organs produce sperm, and
female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive
organs may be on the same or different plants.

#### How Do Plants Obtain Food? {#10.html#x-ck12-SG93IERvIFBsYW50cyBPYnRhaW4gRm9vZD8.-rlk}

Almost all plants make food by **photosynthesis** . Only about 1 percent
of the estimated 300,000 species of plants have lost the ability to
photosynthesize. These other species are consumers, many of them
predators. How do plants prey on other organisms? The Venus fly trap in
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTAxLXZlbnVzLWZseS10cmFw)
shows one way this occurs.

**Figure 10.1**

Venus fly trap plants use their flowers to trap insects. The flowers
secrete enzymes that digest the insects, and then they absorb the
resulting nutrient molecules.

</div>

#### What Do Plants Need? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBEbyBQbGFudHMgTmVlZD8.-t0b}

Plants need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing
and photosynthesizing. They also need sunlight, carbon dioxide, and
water for photosynthesis. Like most other organisms, plants need oxygen
for cellular respiration and minerals to build proteins and other
organic molecules. Most plants support themselves above the ground with
stiff stems in order to get light, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Most
plants also grow roots down into the soil to absorb water and minerals.
And, of course, we need the energy stored in plants through
photosynthesis to survive. Life as we know it would not be possible
without plants.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-xi1}

-   Plants are multicellular eukaryotes. They have organelles called
    chloroplasts and cell walls made of cellulose.
-   Plants also have specialized reproductive organs.
-   Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis.

**What is so special about this particular plant?**

Look at this plant. You could say it has some interesting fruit. Some
might say the fruit does not even look that tasty. However, this is a
cacao tree, and its seeds are the source of chocolate. So, there are
some people who would argue that this is one of the most important
plants in the whole plant kingdom.

### The Importance of Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEltcG9ydGFuY2Ugb2YgUGxhbnRz_1-h4j}

The importance of plants to humans and just about all other life on
Earth is staggering. Life as we know it would not be possible without
plants. Why are plants so important?

-   Plants supply food to nearly all terrestrial organisms,
    including humans. We eat either plants or other organisms that
    eat plants.
-   Plants maintain the atmosphere. They produce oxygen and absorb
    carbon dioxide during **photosynthesis** . Oxygen is essential for
    cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms. It also maintains
    the ozone layer that helps protect Earth’s life from damaging
    UV radiation. Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces
    the greenhouse effect and global warming.
-   Plants recycle matter in biogeochemical cycles. For example, through
    **transpiration** , plants move enormous amounts of water from the
    soil to the atmosphere. Plants such as peas host bacteria that
    fix nitrogen. This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which
    pass it on to consumers.
-   Plants provide many products for human use, such as firewood,
    timber, fibers, medicines, dyes, pesticides, oils, and rubber.
-   Plants create habitats for many organisms. A single tree may provide
    food and shelter to many species of insects, worms, small mammals,
    birds, and reptiles (see **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTAyLXJlZC1leWVkLWZyb2c.) ).

We obviously can’t live without plants, but sometimes they cause us
problems. Many plants are weeds. **Weeds** are plants that grow where
people don’t want them, such as gardens and lawns. They take up space
and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants. People
often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators
and parasites. The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out
native plants. Many plants produce **pollen** , which can cause
allergies. Plants may also produce toxins that harm human health (see
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTAzLXBvaXNvbi1pdnk.) ).

### Why Study Plants? {#10.html#x-ck12-V2h5IFN0dWR5IFBsYW50cz8._1-6x9}

Members of the plant kingdom play many crucial and sometimes surprising
roles in the drama of life on Earth. You are probably familiar with some
reasons plants are important. Why should you understand how plants live?
Because plants play many roles, including but certainly not limited to:

1.  Supplying Food and Energy
2.  Maintaining Earth’s Atmosphere
3.  Cycling Water and Nurturing Soils
4.  Contributing to Nitrogen and Other Biogeochemical Cycles
5.  Interdependence with Animals
6.  Interdependence with Fungi
7.  Interdependence Among Plants
8.  Resources for Humans
9.  Aesthetics for Humans
10. Scientific Use by Humans
11. Causing Problems

More than 100,000 natural compounds come from plants, and most of these
have yet to be explored. Some of the most powerful and useful compounds
come from plants. Who knew they could help us unlock some of the
biology's mysteries - all using an approach of mapping biological
pathways. For more information, see *Solving Biology's Mysteries with

**How do plants reproduce?**

Is it really due to the birds and the bees? Not always. Even though it
is spotted, this plant is known as the kangaroo fern, not the cheetah
fern. And all those spots are spores. So what's a spore? Each spore can
grow into a new individual without the need for fertilization.

### Life Cycle of Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBDeWNsZSBvZiBQbGFudHM._2-1oe}

All plants have a characteristic **life cycle** that includes
**alternation of generations** . Plants alternate between haploid and
diploid generations. Alternation of generations allows for both asexual
and sexual reproduction. Beginning with the diploid **sporophyte** ,
**spores** form from meiosis. Asexual reproduction with spores produces
haploid individuals called **gametophytes** , which produce haploid
gametes by mitosis. Sexual reproduction with gametes and fertilization
produces the diploid sporophyte. A typical plant’s life cycle is
diagrammed in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTA0LXBsYW50LWxpZmUtY3ljbGU.) .

cycle as haploid gametophytes. Spores require little energy and matter
to produce, and they grow into new individuals without the need for
fertilization. In contrast, most modern plants reproduce with gametes
using pollen and seeds, and they spend most of their life cycle as
diploid sporophytes. Many modern plants can also reproduce asexually
using roots, stems, or leaves. This is called **vegetative
reproduction** . One way this can occur is shown in **Figure**

**Which moved onto land first, plants or animals?**

This fossilized fern may be millions of years old. Over 200 million
years ago, the first evidence of ferns related to several modern
families appeared. The "great fern radiation" occurred in the
late-Cretaceous, which ended 65 million years ago, when many modern
families of ferns first appeared. And if animals were the first on land,
would many have starved?

### Evolution of Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFBsYW50cw.._3-ugq}

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTA2LXBsYW50LWV2b2x1dGlvbg..) , plants
are thought to have evolved from an aquatic green alga protist. Later,
they evolved important adaptations for land, including vascular tissues,
seeds, and flowers. Each of these major adaptations made plants better
suited for life on dry land and much more successful.

From a simple, green alga ancestor that lived in the water, plants
eventually evolved several major adaptations for life on land.

</div>

#### The Earliest Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEVhcmxpZXN0IFBsYW50cw.._3-o6i}

The earliest plants were probably similar to the **stonewort** , an
aquatic algae pictured in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTA3LXN0b25ld29ydHM.) . Unlike most
modern plants, stoneworts have stalks rather than stiff stems, and they
have hair-like structures called **rhizoids** instead of roots. On the
other hand, stoneworts have distinct male and female reproductive
structures, which is a plant characteristic. For fertilization to occur,
sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs. In all
these ways, the first plants may have resembled stoneworts.

#### Life on Land {#10.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBvbiBMYW5k_3-tu0}

By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the
dominant organisms in the ocean. Plants were also constrained to the
upper layer of water that received enough sunlight for photosynthesis.
Therefore, plants never became dominant marine organisms. But when
plants moved onto land, everything was wide open. Why was the land
devoid of other life? Without plants growing on land, there was nothing
for other organisms to feed on. Land could not be colonized by other
organisms until land plants became established.

Plants may have colonized the land as early as 700 million years ago.
The oldest fossils of land plants date back about 470 million years. The
first land plants probably resembled modern plants called **liverworts**
, like the one shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTA4LWxpdmVyd29ydHM.) .

**Figure 10.8**

The first land plants may have been similar to liverworts like this one.

</div>

Colonization of the land was a huge step in plant evolution. Until then,
virtually all life had evolved in the ocean. Dry land was a very
different kind of place. The biggest problem was the dryness. Simply
absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge. It kept early
plants small and low to the ground. Water was also needed for sexual
reproduction, so sperm could swim to eggs. In addition, temperatures on
land were extreme and always changing. Sunlight was also strong and
dangerous. It put land organisms at high risk of mutations.

#### Vascular Plants Evolve {#10.html#x-ck12-VmFzY3VsYXIgUGxhbnRzIEV2b2x2ZQ.._3-glp}

Plants evolved a number of adaptations that helped them cope with these
problems on dry land. One of the earliest and most important was the
evolution of vascular tissues. **Vascular tissues** form a plant’s
“plumbing system.” They carry water and minerals from soil to leaves for
photosynthesis. They also carry food (sugar dissolved in water) from
photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage.
The evolution of vascular tissues revolutionized the plant kingdom. The
tissues allowed plants to grow large and endure periods of drought in
harsh land environments. Early vascular plants probably resembled the
fern shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTA5LXdoaXNrLWZlcm4.) .

**Figure 10.9**

Early vascular plants may have looked like this modern fern.

</div>

In addition to vascular tissues, these early plants evolved other
adaptations to life on land, including lignin, leaves, roots, and a
change in their life cycle.

-   **Lignin** is a tough carbohydrate molecule that is hydrophobic
    (“water fearing”). It adds support to vascular tissues in stems. It
    also waterproofs the tissues so they don’t leak, which makes them
    more efficient at transporting fluids. Because most other organisms
    cannot break down lignin, it helps protect plants from herbivores
    and parasites.
-   Leaves are rich in chloroplasts that function as solar collectors
    and food factories. The first leaves were very small, but leaves
    became larger over time.
-   **Roots** are vascular organs that can penetrate soil and even rock.
    They absorb water and minerals from soil and carry them to leaves.
    They also anchor a plant in the soil. Roots evolved from rhizoids,
    which nonvascular plants had used for absorption.
-   Land plants evolved a dominant diploid sporophyte generation. This
    was adaptive because diploid individuals are less likely to suffer
    harmful effects of mutations. They have two copies of each gene, so
    if a mutation occurs in one gene, they have a backup copy. This is
    extremely important on land, where there’s a lot of solar radiation.

With all these advantages, it’s easy to see why vascular plants spread
quickly and widely on land. Many nonvascular plants went extinct as
vascular plants became more numerous. Vascular plants are now the
dominant land plants on Earth.

    green alga ancestor.

**Why are they called sunflowers?**

When the plant is in the bud stage, the flower tends to track the
movement of the sun across the horizon, hence the name sunflower.
Flowering plants were the last group of plants to evolve. The flower
contains both the male and female reproductive structures, and these
plants have become tremendously successful. But these plants could not
have evolved without the prior evolution of the seed. So what exactly is
a seed?

### Seed Plants Emerge {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VlZCBQbGFudHMgRW1lcmdl_4-dac}

For reproduction, early vascular plants still needed moisture. Sperm had
to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization.
Spores also needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well. Of
course, dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for
tiny new offspring plants to survive. With the evolution of **seeds** in
vascular plants, all that changed. Seed plants evolved a number of
adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water. As a
result, seed plants were wildly successful. They exploded into virtually
all of Earth’s habitats.

Why are seeds so adaptive on land? A seed contains an embryo and a food
supply enclosed within a tough coating. An embryo is a zygote that has
already started to develop and grow. Early growth and development of a
plant embryo in a seed is called **germination** . The seed protects and
nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the “race” of
life. Many seeds can wait to germinate until conditions are favorable
for growth. This increases the offspring’s chance of surviving even
more.

Other reproductive adaptations that evolved in seed plants include
ovules, pollen, pollen tubes, and pollination by animals.

-   An **ovule** is a female reproductive structure in seed plants that
    contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an
    egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops
    into a seed.
-   A grain of **pollen** is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough
    capsule (see **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTEwLXBvbGxlbi1ncmFpbi1iZWUtY29tcG9zaXRl) ).
    It carries sperm to an ovule while preventing it from drying out.
    Pollen grains can’t swim, but they are very light, so the wind can
    carry them. Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water.
-   Wind-blown pollen might land anywhere and be wasted. Another
    adaptation solved this problem. Plants evolved traits that attract
    specific animal **pollinators** . Like the bee in **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTEwLXBvbGxlbi1ncmFpbi1iZWUtY29tcG9zaXRl)
    , a pollinator picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly
    to another plant of the same species. This greatly increases the
    chance that fertilization will occur.
-   Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a **pollen
    tube** , through which sperm could be transferred directly from the
    pollen grain to the egg. This allowed sperm to reach an egg without
    swimming through a film of water. It finally freed up plants from
    depending on moisture to reproduce.

#### Seed Plants Diverge {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VlZCBQbGFudHMgRGl2ZXJnZQ.._4-yls}

The first seed plants formed seeds in cones. **Cones** are made up of
overlapping scales, which are modified leaves (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTExLXNlZWQtY29uZS1zY2FsZXM.) ). Male
cones contain pollen, and female cones contain eggs. Seeds also develop
in female cones. Modern seed plants that produce seeds in cones are
called **gymnosperms** .

**Figure 10.11**

Later, seed plants called **angiosperms** evolved. They produce
**flowers** , which consist of both male and female reproductive
structures. The female reproductive structure in a flower includes an
organ called an **ovary** . Eggs form in ovules inside ovaries, which
also enclose and protect developing seeds after fertilization occurs. In
many species of flowering plants, ovaries develop into **fruits** ,
which attract animals that disperse the seeds.

So many different types of plants. Does the plant have roots? Or
flowers? Or just seeds? Or roots and stems but not seeds? These are all
characteristics used to classify plants. How many different types of
plants do you see in this Japanese garden?

### Classification of Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgUGxhbnRz_5-mhn}

The scientific classification of modern land plants is under constant
revision. Informally, land plants can be classified into the groups
listed in **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6bGFuZC1wbGFudC1jbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg..) .
Major divisions and types of modern land plants are organized in this
table. Why do the first five types of plants require a moist habitat?

The most basic division is between **nonvascular plants** and **vascular
plants** . Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce
without **seeds** and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in
turn, are divided into those that produce seeds in **cones** and those
that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. Seed plants are called
**gymnosperms** . Seed plants called **angiosperms** produce seeds in
the ovaries of **flowers** .

**Do all plants have roots?**

The massive moss covering these branches seems to be dominating its
habitat. And maybe it is. Mosses, being nonvascular plants, don't need
roots to grow, so they can easily cover moist areas. Mosses commonly
grow close together in clumps or mats in damp or shady locations. You
may even have mats of moss growing in your backyard.

### Nonvascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-Tm9udmFzY3VsYXIgUGxhbnRz_6-lf6}

Nonvascular plants are **bryophytes** . Despite the dominance of
vascular plants today, more than 17,000 species of bryophytes still
survive. They include **liverworts, hornworts,** and **mosses.**

#### Characteristics of Nonvascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIE5vbnZhc2N1bGFyIFBsYW50cw.._6-lur}

Most bryophytes are small. They not only lack vascular tissues; they
also lack true leaves, seeds, and flowers. Instead of roots, they have
hair-like **rhizoids** to anchor them to the ground and to absorb water
and minerals (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTEyLWJyeW9waHl0ZS1yaGl6b2lkcw..) ).
Bryophytes occupy niches in moist habitats, but, as they lack vascular
tissue, they are not very efficient at absorbing water.

bryophyte](ck12_10_files/20150914104957760203.jpeg "Rhizoids on a bryophyte")

**Figure 10.12**

The rhizoids of a bryophyte may be so fine that they are just one cell
thick.

</div>

Bryophytes also depend on moisture to reproduce. Sperm produced by a
male gametophyte must swim through a layer of rainwater or dew to reach
an egg produced by a female gametophyte. The tiny, diploid sporophyte
generation then undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. The spores
may also need moisture to disperse.

#### Evolution of Nonvascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE5vbnZhc2N1bGFyIFBsYW50cw.._6-fpa}

Nonvascular plants were the first plants to evolve. Compared to other
plants, their small size and lack of specialized structures, such as
vascular tissue, stems, leaves, or flowers, explains why these plants
evolved first. The first nonvascular plants to evolve were the
liverworts. The hornworts evolved somewhat later, and mosses apparently
evolved last. Of all the bryophytes, mosses are most similar to vascular
plants. Presumably, they share the most recent common ancestor with
vascular plants.

#### Diversity of Nonvascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJzaXR5IG9mIE5vbnZhc2N1bGFyIFBsYW50cw.._6-de7}

The three types of modern nonvascular plants are pictured in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTEzLWJyeW9waHl0ZS1jb21wb3NpdGU.) .

-   Liverworts are tiny nonvascular plants that have leaf-like, lobed,
    or ribbon-like photosynthetic tissues rather than leaves. Their
    rhizoids are very fine, they lack stems, and they are generally less
    than 10 centimeters (4 inches) tall. They often grow in colonies
    that carpet the ground.
-   Hornworts are minute nonvascular plants, similar in size
    to liverworts. They also have very fine rhizoids and lack stems.
    Their sporophytes are long and pointed, like tiny horns. They rise
    several centimeters above the gametophytes of the plant.
-   Mosses are larger nonvascular plants that have coarser,
    multicellular rhizoids that are more like roots. They also have
    tiny, photosynthetic structures similar to leaves that encircle a
    central stem-like structure. Mosses grow in dense clumps, which help
    them retain moisture.

**How does water move from the roots to the top of these trees?**

Redwood trees found in Yosemite National Park in California. Big? Of
course. How do these trees grow so tall? It has a lot to do with a very
efficient system to move water, sugars and other nutrients. But the
first plants to have such a "vascular system" were not tall trees, but
much smaller plants.

### Vascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-VmFzY3VsYXIgUGxhbnRz_7-bwy}

Vascular plants are known as **tracheophytes** , which literally means
“tube plants.” The earliest vascular plants quickly came to dominate
terrestrial ecosystems. Why were they so successful? It was mainly
because of their tube-like vascular tissues.

#### Vascular Tissues {#10.html#x-ck12-VmFzY3VsYXIgVGlzc3Vlcw.._7-nu6}

The vascular tissues for which these plants are named are specialized to
transport fluid. They consist of long, narrow cells arranged end-to-end,
forming tubes. There are two different types of vascular tissues, called
xylem and phloem. Both are shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTE0LXh5bGVtLXBobG9lbQ..) .

-   **Xylem** is vascular tissue that transports water and dissolved
    minerals from roots to stems and leaves. This type of tissue
    consists of dead cells that lack end walls between adjacent cells.
    The side walls are thick and reinforced with lignin, which makes
    them stiff and water proof.
-   **Phloem** is vascular tissue that transports food (sugar dissolved
    in water) from photosynthetic cells to other parts of the plant for
    growth or storage. This type of tissue consists of living cells that
    are separated by end walls with tiny perforations, or holes.

#### Evolution of Vascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFZhc2N1bGFyIFBsYW50cw.._7-qct}

The first vascular plants evolved about 420 million years ago. They
probably evolved from moss-like bryophyte ancestors, but they had a life
cycle dominated by the diploid sporophyte generation. As they continued
to evolve, early vascular plants became more plant-like in other ways as
well.

-   Vascular plants evolved true **roots** made of vascular tissues.
    Compared with rhizoids, roots can absorb more water and minerals
    from the soil. They also anchor plants securely in the ground, so
    plants can grow larger without toppling over.
-   Vascular plants evolved **stems** made of vascular tissues and
    **lignin** . Because of lignin, stems are stiff, so plants can grow
    high above the ground where they can get more light and air. Because
    of their vascular tissues, stems keep even tall plants supplied with
    water so they don’t dry out in the air.
-   Vascular plants evolved **leaves** to collect sunlight. At first,
    leaves were tiny and needle-like, which helped reduce water loss.
    Later, leaves were much larger and broader, so plants could collect
    more light.

With their vascular tissues and other adaptations, early vascular plants
had the edge over nonvascular plants. The could grow tall and take
advantage of sunlight high up in the air. Bryophytes were the
photosynthetic pioneers onto land, but early vascular plants were the
photosynthetic pioneers into air.

#### Diversity of Seedless Vascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RGl2ZXJzaXR5IG9mIFNlZWRsZXNzIFZhc2N1bGFyIFBsYW50cw.._7-wv0}

Surviving descendants of early vascular plants include **clubmosses**
and **ferns** . There are 1,200 species of clubmoss and more than 20,000
species of fern. Both types of vascular plants are seedless and
reproduce with spores. Two examples are pictured in **Figures**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMjIwMy0xMQ..) and
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvSUktMjIwMy0xOQ..) .

-   Clubmosses look like mosses and grow low to the ground. Unlike
    mosses, they have roots, stems, and leaves, although the leaves are
    very small.
-   Ferns look more like “typical” plants. They have large leaves and
    may grow very tall. Some even develop into trees.

**How old can a plant be?**

This is obviously a seed plant. It is a Gingko tree, which is an unique
species in that there are no close living relatives. Gingkoes can live
for a very long time. Some specimens of this species are thought to be
over 2,500 years old. The Ginkgo is also known as a living fossil, with
fossils related to modern Ginkgo from the Permian period, dating back
270 million years.

### Seed Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-U2VlZCBQbGFudHM._8-moq}

Seed plants are called **spermatophytes** . The evolution of seeds by
vascular plants was a very big deal. In fact, it was arguably as
important as the evolution of vascular tissues. Seeds solved the problem
of releasing offspring into a dry world. Once seeds evolved, vascular
seed plants and their descendants diversified to fill terrestrial niches
everywhere. Today, vascular seed plants dominate Earth.

#### Parts of a Seed {#10.html#x-ck12-UGFydHMgb2YgYSBTZWVk_8-ujb}

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTE2LXBhcnRzLW9mLXNlZWQ.) , a seed
consists of at least three basic parts: the embryo, seed coat, and
stored food.

-   The **embryo** develops from a fertilized egg. While still inside
    the seed, the embryo forms its first leaf (cotyledon) and starts to
    develop a stem (hypocotyl) and root (radicle).
-   The tough **seed coat** protects the embryo and keeps it from drying
    out until conditions are favorable for germination.
-   The stored food in a seed is called **endosperm** . It nourishes the
    embryo until it can start making food on its own.

[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTE3LWRhbmRlbGlvbi1tYXBsZS1idXJkb2NrLXNlZWQtY29tcG9zaXRl)
. Structures may help them travel in the wind or stick to animals.
Dispersal of seeds away from parent plants helps reduce competition with
the parents and increases the chance of offspring surviving.

cones) and **angiosperms** (seeds in ovaries of flowers). **Figure**

#### Evolution of Seed Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFNlZWQgUGxhbnRz_8-3x6}

The earliest seed plants probably evolved close to 300 million years
ago. They were similar to modern ginkgoes and reproduced with pollen and
seeds in cones. Early seed plants quickly came to dominate forests
during the Mesozoic Era, or Age of the Dinosaurs, about 250 to 65
million years ago.

As seed plants continued to evolve, Earth’s overall climate became
drier, so early seed plants evolved adaptations to help them live with
low levels of water. Some also evolved adaptations to cold. They had
woody trunks and needle-like, evergreen leaves covered with a thick
coating of waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Some of the trees were
huge, like today’s giant sequoia, a modern conifer (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTE5LWdpYW50LXNlcXVvaWE.) ).

The person standing at the foot of this giant sequoia show just how
enormous the tree is. Some early seed plants also grew very large.

</div>

Eventually, some gymnosperms started to evolve angiosperm-like traits.
For example, cycad ancestors were the first plants to use insects as
pollinators. They also used birds and monkeys to disperse their brightly
colored seeds. Of modern gymnosperms, Gnetae probably share the most
recent common ancestor with angiosperms. Among other similarities,
Gnetae produce **nectar** , a sweet, sugary liquid that attracts insect
pollinators. Most modern flowering plants also produce nectar.

structure. Why are flowers so colorful? What is the purpose of all the
parts? They were one of the last adaptations of the plant kingdom,
suggesting immense evolutionary significance.

### Flowering Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-Rmxvd2VyaW5nIFBsYW50cw.._9-dm9}

**Angiosperms** , or flowering seed plants, form seeds in ovaries. As
the seeds develop, the ovaries may develop into fruits. Flowers attract
pollinators, and fruits encourage animals to disperse the seeds.

#### Parts of a Flower {#10.html#x-ck12-UGFydHMgb2YgYSBGbG93ZXI._9-xrb}

A flower consists of male and female reproductive structures. The main
parts of a flower are shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTIwLUZsb3dlcg..) . They include the
stamen, pistil, petals, and sepals.

-   The **stamen** is the male reproductive structure of a flower. It
    consists of a stalk-like filament that ends in an **anther** . The
    anther contains pollen sacs, in which meiosis occurs and pollen
    grains form. The filament raises the anther up high so its
    **pollen** will be more likely to blow in the wind or be picked up
    by an animal pollinator.
-   The **pistil** is the female reproductive structure of a flower. It
    consists of a **stigma, style** , and **ovary** . The stigma is
    raised and sticky to help it catch pollen. The style supports the
    stigma and connects it to the ovary, which contains the egg.
    **Petals** attract pollinators to the flower. Petals are often
    brightly colored so pollinators will notice them.
-   **Sepals** protect the developing flower while it is still a bud.
    Sepals are usually green, which camouflages the bud from
    possible consumers.

#### Flowers and Pollinators {#10.html#x-ck12-Rmxvd2VycyBhbmQgUG9sbGluYXRvcnM._9-nrh}

Many flowers have bright colors, strong scents, and sweet nectar to
attract animal pollinators. They may attract insects, birds, mammals,
and even reptiles. While visiting a flower, a pollinator picks up pollen
from the anthers. When the pollinator visits the next flower, some of
the pollen brushes off on the stigma. This allows cross-pollination,
which increases genetic diversity.

See *The beauty of pollination* at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHkq1edcbk4](watch?v=xHkq1edcbk4) for an
amazing look at this process.

#### Other Characteristics of Flowering Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgQ2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEZsb3dlcmluZyBQbGFudHM._9-hix}

Although flowers and their components are the major innovations of
angiosperms, they are not the only ones. Angiosperms also have more
efficient vascular tissues. Additionally, in many flowering plants the
ovaries ripen into fruits. Fruits are often brightly colored, so animals
are likely to see and eat them and disperse their seeds (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTIxLWFwcGxlLXRyZWVz) ).

#### Evolution of Flowering Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEZsb3dlcmluZyBQbGFudHM._9-xis}

Flowering plants are thought to have evolved at least 200 million years
ago from gymnosperms like Gnetae. The earliest known fossils of
flowering plants are about 125 million years old. The fossil flowers
have male and female reproductive organs but no petals or sepals.

Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other
animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly
increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which
might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better
advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly
colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination,
flowers gave the pollinators nectar.

Giving free nectar to any animal that happened to come along was not an
efficient use of resources. Much of the pollen might be carried to
flowers of different species and therefore wasted. As a result, many
plants evolved ways to “hide” their nectar from all but very specific
pollinators, which would be more likely to visit only flowers of the
same species. For their part, animal pollinators co-evolved traits that
allowed them to get to the hidden nectar. Two examples of this type of
co-evolution are shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTIyLWh1bW1pbmdiaXJkLWZsb3dlci1jb21wb3NpdGU.)

Some of the most recent angiosperms to evolve are grasses. Humans
started domesticating grasses such as wheat about 10,000 years ago. Why
grasses? They have many large, edible seeds that contain a lot of
nutritious stored food. They are also relatively easy to harvest. Since
then, humans have helped shaped the evolution of grasses, as illustrated
by the example in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE1LTIzLXRlb3NpbnRlLWNvcm4.) . Grasses
supply most of the food consumed by people worldwide. What other grass

#### Classification of Flowering Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgRmxvd2VyaW5nIFBsYW50cw.._9-pf8}

There are more than a quarter million species of flowering plants, and
they show tremendous diversity. Nonetheless, almost all flowering plants
fall into one of three major groups: **monocots, eudicots** , or
**magnolids** . The three groups differ in several ways. For example,
monocot embryos form just one **cotyledon** , whereas eudicot and
magnolid embryos form two cotyledons. The arrangement of their vascular
tissues is also different. Examples of the three groups of flowering
plants are given in **Table**

    ovaries of flowers.
-   Ovaries may develop into fruits.
-   Flowers attract pollinators and fruits are eaten by animals. Both
    traits aid the dispersal of seeds.

### Organs in Plants? {#10.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5zIGluIFBsYW50cz8._10-ukn}

Your body includes organ systems, such as the digestive system, made of
individual organs, such as the stomach, liver, and pancreas, which work
together to carry out a certain function (in this case, breaking down
and absorbing food). These organs, in turn, are made of different kinds
of tissues, which are groups of cells which work together to perform a
specific job. For example, your stomach is made of muscle tissue to
facilitate movement and glandular tissue to secrete enzymes for chemical
breakdown of food molecules. These tissues, in turn, are made of cells
specialized in shape, size, and component organelles, such as
mitochondria for energy and microtubules for movement.

Plants, too, are made of organs, which in turn are made of tissues.
Plant tissues, like ours, are constructed of specialized cells, which in
turn contain specific organelles. It is these cells, tissues, and organs
that carry out the dramatic lives of plants.

### Plant Cells {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgQ2VsbHM._10-uoy}

Plant cells resemble other eukaryotic cells in many ways. For example,
they are enclosed by a plasma membrane and have a nucleus and other
membrane-bound organelles. A typical plant cell is represented by the
diagram in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTAxLXBsYW50LWNlbGw.) .

</div>

#### Plant Cell Structures {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgQ2VsbCBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVz_10-mry}

Structures found in plant cells but not animal cells include a large
central vacuole, cell wall, and plastids such as chloroplasts.

-   The large **central vacuole** is surrounded by its own membrane and
    contains water and dissolved substances. Its primary role is to
    maintain pressure against the inside of the cell wall, giving the
    cell shape and helping to support the plant.
-   The **cell wall** is located outside the cell membrane. It consists
    mainly of **cellulose** and may also contain **lignin** , which
    makes it more rigid. The cell wall shapes, supports, and protects
    the cell. It prevents the cell from absorbing too much water
    and bursting. It also keeps large, damaging molecules out of
    the cell.
-   **Plastids** are membrane-bound organelles with their own DNA.
    Examples are chloroplasts and chromoplasts. **Chloroplasts** contain
    the green pigment **chlorophyll** and carry out **photosynthesis** .
    Chromoplasts make and store other pigments. They give flower petals
    their bright colors.

#### Types of Plant Cells {#10.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUGxhbnQgQ2VsbHM._10-d2g}

There are three basic types of cells in most plants. These cells make up
ground tissue, which will be discussed in another concept. The three
types of cells are described in **Table**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cGxhbnQtY2VsbC10eXBlcw..) . The
different types of plant cells have different structures and functions.

Is it just a random artistic piece? Is it a depiction of a pattern of

center portion of a carrot taproot. And these are all cells. Cells that
have come together to form a tissue, with a specific function. What do
you think is the main function of tissue in a plant's root?

### Plant Tissues {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgVGlzc3Vlcw.._11-iz6}

As for all animals, your body is made of four types of tissue:
epidermal, muscle, nerve, and connective tissues. Plants, too, are built
of tissues, but not surprisingly, their very different lifestyles derive
from different kinds of tissues. All three types of plant cells are
found in most plant tissues. Three major types of plant tissues are
dermal, ground, and vascular tissues.

#### Dermal Tissue {#10.html#x-ck12-RGVybWFsIFRpc3N1ZQ.._11-i56}

**Dermal tissue** covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of
cells called the **epidermis** . You can think of the epidermis as the
plant’s skin. It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and
its environment. Epidermal cells secrete a waxy substance called
**cuticle** , which coats, waterproofs, and protects the above-ground
parts of plants. Cuticle helps prevent water loss, abrasions,
infections, and damage from toxins.

This tissue includes several types of specialized cells. Pavement cells,
large, irregularly shaped parenchymal cells which lack chloroplasts,
make up the majority of the epidermis. Within the epidermis, thousands
of pairs of bean-shaped schlerenchymal **guard cells** swell and shrink
by osmosis to open and close **stomata** , tiny pores which control the
exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases and the release of water
vapor. The lower surfaces of some leaves contain as many as 100,000
stomata per square centimeter.

The epidermis of *Arabidopsis* shows both pavement cells (A) and stomata
made of sclerenchymal **guard cells** (B), which control water loss and

</div>

#### Ground Tissue {#10.html#x-ck12-R3JvdW5kIFRpc3N1ZQ.._11-si5}

**Ground tissue** makes up much of the interior of a plant and carries
out basic metabolic functions. Ground tissue in stems provides support
and may store food or water. Ground tissues in roots may also store
food.

#### Vascular Tissue {#10.html#x-ck12-VmFzY3VsYXIgVGlzc3Vl_11-i79}

**Vascular tissue** runs through the ground tissue inside a plant. Your
body was able to grow from a single cell to perhaps 100 trillion cells
because, 21 days after fertilization, a tiny heart began to pump blood
throughout your tiny self – and it hasn’t stopped since. The blood it
pumps carries water, oxygen and nutrients to each one of your trillions
of cells, and removes CO ~2~ and other wastes. Of course plants don’t
have hearts, but they do have vessels that transport water, minerals,
and nutrients through the plant. These vessels are the vascular tissue,
and consist of **xylem** and **phloem** . Xylem and phloem are packaged
together in bundles, as shown in **Figure**

**So how do plants grow?**

There must be an area of growth, similar to how the bones in your
fingers, arms, and legs grow longer. There is, and it is called the
apical meristem, which is shown here.

### Growth of Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIG9mIFBsYW50cw.._12-fxj}

Most plants continue to grow throughout their lives. Like other
multicellular organisms, plants grow through a combination of cell
growth and cell division. Cell growth increases cell size, while cell
division (mitosis) increases the number of cells. As plant cells grow,
they also become specialized into different cell types through cellular
differentiation. Once cells differentiate, they can no longer divide.
How do plants grow or replace damaged cells after that?

The key to continued growth and repair of plant cells is **meristem** .
Meristem is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells
that can continue to divide and differentiate.

**Apical meristems** are found at the apex, or tip, of roots and buds,
allowing roots and stems to grow in length and leaves and flowers to
differentiate. Roots and stems grow in length because the meristem adds
tissue “behind” it, constantly propelling itself further into the ground
(for roots) or air (for stems). Often, the apical meristem of a single
branch will become dominant, suppressing the growth of meristems on
other branches and leading to the development of a single trunk. In
grasses, meristems at the base of the leaf blades allow for regrowth
after grazing by herbivores – or mowing by lawnmowers.

**Figure 10.28**

Microphotograph of the root tip of a broad bean show rapidly dividing
apical meristem tissue just behind the root cap. Numerous cells in
various stages of mitosis can be observed.

</div>

Apical meristems differentiate into the three basic types of meristem
tissue which correspond to the three types of tissue: protoderm produces
new epidermis, ground meristem produces ground tissue, and procambium
produces new xylem and phloem. These three types of meristem are
considered **primary meristem** because they allow growth in length or
height, which is known as primary growth.

**Secondary meristems** allow growth in diameter (secondary growth) in
woody plants. Herbaceous plants do not have secondary growth. The two
types of secondary meristem are both named **cambium** , meaning
“exchange” or “change”. **Vascular cambium** produces secondary xylem
(toward the center of the stem or root) and phloem (toward the outside
of the stem or root), adding growth to the diameter of the plant. This
process produces wood, and builds the sturdy trunks of trees. **Cork
cambium** lies between the epidermis and the phloem, and replaces the
epidermis of roots and stems with bark, one layer of which is cork.

**Figure 10.29**

Woody plants grow in two ways. **Primary growth** adds length or height,
mediated by apical meristem tissue at the tips of roots and shoots –
which is difficult to show clearly in cross-sectional diagrams.
**Secondary growth** adds to the diameter of a stem or root; vascular
cambium adds xylem (inward) and phloem (outward), and cork cambium
replaces epidermis with bark.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-m7i}

-   Most plants continue to grow as long as they live. They grow through
    a combination of cell growth and cell division (mitosis).
-   The key to plant growth is meristem, a type of plant tissue
    consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide
    and differentiate.
-   Meristem allows plant stems and roots to grow longer
    (primary growth) and wider (secondary growth).

**Now those are some serious roots. But what exactly are roots?**

There are taproots and fibrous roots, primary roots and secondary roots.
And they always seem to know which way to grow. Roots are very special
plant organs. How and why?

### Roots {#10.html#x-ck12-Um9vdHM._13-qds}

Plants have specialized organs that help them survive and reproduce in a
great diversity of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots,
stems, and leaves.

**Roots** are important organs in all vascular plants. Most vascular
plants have two types of roots: **primary roots** that grow downward and
**secondary roots** that branch out to the side. Together, all the roots
of a plant make up a **root system** .

#### Root Systems {#10.html#x-ck12-Um9vdCBTeXN0ZW1z_13-2ub}

There are two basic types of root systems in plants: taproot systems and
fibrous root systems. Both are illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTAzLXJvb3Qtc3lzdGVtcy1jb21wb3NpdGU.) .

-   **Taproot systems** feature a single, thick primary root, called the
    **taproot** , with smaller secondary roots growing out from
    the sides. The taproot may penetrate as many as 60 meters (almost
    200 feet) below the ground surface. It can plumb very deep water
    sources and store a lot of food to help the plant survive drought
    and other environmental extremes. The taproot also anchors the plant
    very securely in the ground.
-   **Fibrous root systems** have many small branching roots, called
    **fibrous roots** , but no large primary root. The huge number of
    threadlike roots increases the surface area for absorption of water
    and minerals, but fibrous roots anchor the plant less securely.

#### Root Structures and Functions {#10.html#x-ck12-Um9vdCBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVzIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbnM._13-mgx}

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA0LXJvb3QtZGlhZ3JhbQ..) , the tip of a
root is called the **root cap** . It consists of specialized cells that
help regulate primary growth of the root at the tip. Above the root cap
is primary meristem, where growth in length occurs.

![Parts of a
root](ck12_10_files/20150914105007542249.jpeg "Parts of a root")

**Figure 10.31**

A root is a complex organ consisting of several types of tissue. What is
the function of each tissue type?

</div>

Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer
of epidermal cells. These cells may have **root hairs** that increase
the surface area for the absorption of water and minerals from the soil.
Beneath the epidermis is ground tissue, which may be filled with stored
starch. Bundles of vascular tissues form the center of the root. Waxy
layers waterproof the vascular tissues so they don’t leak, making them
more efficient at carrying fluids. Secondary meristem is located within
and around the vascular tissues. This is where growth in thickness
occurs.

The structure of roots helps them perform their primary functions. What
do roots do? They have three major jobs: absorbing water and minerals,
anchoring and supporting the plant, and storing food.

1.  Absorbing water and minerals: Thin-walled epidermal cells and root
    hairs are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from
    the soil. The roots of many plants also have a mycorrhizal
    relationship with fungi for greater absorption.
2.  Anchoring and supporting the plant: Root systems help anchor plants
    to the ground, allowing plants to grow tall without toppling over. A
    tough covering may replace the epidermis in older roots, making them
    ropelike and even stronger. As shown in **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA1LW1hbmdyb3ZlLWJsb29kcm9vdC1jb21wb3NpdGU.)
    , some roots have unusual specializations for anchoring plants.
3.  Storing food: In many plants, ground tissues in roots store food
    produced by the leaves during photosynthesis. The bloodroot shown in
    **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA1LW1hbmdyb3ZlLWJsb29kcm9vdC1jb21wb3NpdGU.)
    stores food in its roots over the winter.

Mangrove roots are like stilts, allowing mangrove trees to rise high
above the water. The trunk and leaves are above water even at high tide.

</div>

#### Root Growth {#10.html#x-ck12-Um9vdCBHcm93dGg._13-r9j}

Roots have primary and secondary meristems for growth in length and
width. As roots grow longer, they always grow down into the ground. Even
if you turn a plant upside down, its roots will try to grow downward.
How do roots “know” which way to grow? How can they tell down from up?
Specialized cells in root caps are able to detect gravity. The cells
direct meristem in the tips of roots to grow downward toward the center
of Earth. This is generally adaptive for land plants. Can you explain
why?

As roots grow thicker, they can’t absorb water and minerals as well.
However, they may be even better at transporting fluids, anchoring the
plant, and storing food (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA2LXN3ZWV0LXBvdGF0b2Vz) ).

**How does water get up? How does sugar move down?**

What structures hold the plant upright? Are tree trunks also stems? Of
course they are. Trees don't start out big and tall - they grow from
small plants to large trees. And it is these stems that allow them to
grow upright. So, obviously the stem is very important and has numerous
functions.

### Stems {#10.html#x-ck12-U3RlbXM._14-2oq}

In vascular plants, **stems** are the organs that hold plants upright so
they can get the sunlight and air they need. Stems also bear leaves,
flowers, cones, and secondary stems. These structures grow at points
called **nodes** (shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA3LXN0ZW1z) ). At each node, there is
a bud of meristem tissue that can divide and specialize to form a
particular structure.

**Figure 10.34**

The stem of a vascular plant has nodes where leaves and other structures
may grow.

</div>

Another vital function of stems is transporting water and minerals from
roots to leaves and carrying food from leaves to the rest of the plant.
Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not
survive high above ground in the air. In many plants, stems also store
food or water during cold or dry seasons.

#### Stem Diversity {#10.html#x-ck12-U3RlbSBEaXZlcnNpdHk._14-26o}

Stems show variation because many stems are specialized. **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA4LXN0ZW0tZGl2ZXJzaXR5) shows examples
of stem specialization. With specialized stems, plants can exploit a
diversity of niches in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems.

#### Stem Tissues and Functions {#10.html#x-ck12-U3RlbSBUaXNzdWVzIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbnM._14-ker}

Like roots, the stems of vascular plants are made of dermal, vascular,
and ground tissues.

-   A single-celled layer of epidermis protects and waterproofs the stem
    and controls gas exchange.
-   In trees, some of the epidermal tissue is replaced by bark. **Bark**
    is a combination of tissues that provides a tough, woody external
    covering on the stems of trees. The inner part of bark is alive and
    growing; the outer part is dead and provides strength, support,
    and protection.
-   Ground tissue forms the interior of the stem. The large **central
    vacuoles** of ground tissue cells fill with water to support
    the plant. The cells may also store food.
-   Bundles of vascular tissue run through the ground tissue of a stem
    and transport fluids. Plants may vary in how these bundles
    are arranged.

#### Stem Growth {#10.html#x-ck12-U3RlbSBHcm93dGg._14-hjq}

The stems of all vascular plants get longer through primary growth. This
occurs in primary meristem at the tips and nodes of the stems. Most
stems also grow in thickness through secondary growth. This occurs in
secondary meristem, which is located in and around the vascular tissues.
Secondary growth forms secondary vascular tissues and bark. In many
trees, the yearly growth of new vascular tissues results in an annual
growth ring like the one in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTA5LXRyZWUtcmluZ3M.) . When a tree is
cut down, the rings in the trunk can be counted to estimate the tree’s
age.

**Could life exist without the leaf?**

A leaf looks so simple. But it is actually a very complex structure. And
it may be one of the most important organs in all kingdoms. Life as we
know it could not exist without leaves. Why? One word: photosynthesis.

### Leaves {#10.html#x-ck12-TGVhdmVz_15-3as}

Plants have specialized organs that help them survive and reproduce in a
great diversity of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots,
stems, and leaves. **Leaves** are the keys not only to plant life but to
all terrestrial life. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight
and make food by **photosynthesis** . Despite the fundamental importance
of the work they do, there is great diversity in the leaves of plants.
However, given the diversity of habitats in which plants live, it’s not
surprising that there is no single best way to collect solar energy for
photosynthesis.

#### Leaf Variation {#10.html#x-ck12-TGVhZiBWYXJpYXRpb24._15-esb}

Leaves may vary in size, shape, and their arrangement on stems.
Nonflowering vascular plants have three basic types of leaves:
**microphylls** (“tiny leaves”), **fronds** , and **needles** .
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTEwLWxlYWYtdmFyaWF0aW9u)
describes each type.

plants](ck12_10_files/20150914105009407534.jpeg "Leaf variation in nonflowering plants")

**Figure 10.37**

Leaf variation in nonflowering plants reflects their evolutionary
origins. Can you explain how?

</div>

Flowering vascular plants also have diverse leaves. However, the leaves
of all flowering plants have two basic parts in common: the blade and
petiole. The **blade** of the leaf is the relatively wide, flat part of
the leaf that gathers sunlight and undergoes photosynthesis. The
**petiole** is the part that attaches the leaf to a stem of the plant.
This occurs at a node.

Flowering plant leaves vary in how the leaves are arranged on the stem
and how the blade is divided. This is illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTExLWxlYWYtdmFyaWF0aW9uLWZsb3dlcmluZy1wbGFudHM.)
. Generally, the form and arrangement of leaves maximizes light exposure
while conserving water, reducing wind resistance, or benefiting the
plant in some other way in its particular habitat.

-   Leaves arranged in whorls encircle upright stems at intervals. They
    collect sunlight from all directions.
-   Leaves arranged in basal rosettes take advantage of warm
    temperatures near the ground.
-   Leaves arranged in alternate or opposing pairs collect light
    from above. They are typically found on plants with a single,
    upright stem.
-   The blades of simple leaves are not divided. This provides the
    maximum surface area for collecting sunlight.
-   The blades of compound leaves are divided into many
    smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss.

#### Seasonal Changes in Leaves {#10.html#x-ck12-U2Vhc29uYWwgQ2hhbmdlcyBpbiBMZWF2ZXM._15-6zq}

Even if you don’t live in a place where leaves turn color in the fall,
no doubt you’ve seen photos of their “fall colors” (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTE0LWRlY2lkdW91cy10cmVl) ). The leaves
of many plants turn from green to other, glorious colors during autumn
each year. The change is triggered by shorter days and cooler
temperatures. Leaves respond to these environmental stimuli by producing
less **chlorophyll** . This allows other leaf pigments—such as oranges
and yellows—to be seen.

**Figure 10.39**

A deciduous tree goes through dramatic seasonal changes each year. Can
you identify the seasons in the photo?

</div>

After leaves turn color in the fall, they may all fall off the plant for
the winter. Plants that shed their leaves seasonally each year are
called **deciduous** plants. Shedding leaves is a strategy for reducing
water loss during seasons of extreme dryness. On the downside, the plant
must grow new leaves in the spring, and that takes a lot of energy and
matter. Some plants may “bank” energy over the winter by storing food.
That way, they are ready to grow new leaves as soon as spring arrives.

**Evergreen** plants have a different strategy for adapting to seasonal
dryness. They don’t waste energy and matter growing new leaves each
year. Instead, they keep their leaves and stay green year-round.
However, to reduce water loss, they have needle-like leaves with very
thick cuticle. On the downside, needle-like leaves reduce the surface
area for collecting sunlight. This is one reason that needles may be
especially rich in chlorophyll, as you can see from the dark green pine
needles in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTE1LXBpbmUtbmVlZGxlcw..) . This is also
an important adaptation for low levels of sunlight, allowing evergreens
to live far from the equator.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._15-9qd}

-   The primary function of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food
    by photosynthesis.
-   In a deciduous plant, leaves seasonally turn color and fall off
    the plant. They are replaced with new leaves later in the year.
-   An evergreen plant keeps its green leaves year-round. It may have
    needle-like leaves to reduce water loss.

**Oxygen — the oxygen that we breath — is just a waste product of what
reaction?**

Every split second that sunlight hits that leaf, photosynthesis is
initiated, bringing energy into the ecosystem. It could be said that
this is one of the most important - if not the absolutely most important
- biochemical reactions. And it all starts with the leaf.

### Factories for Photosynthesis {#10.html#x-ck12-RmFjdG9yaWVzIGZvciBQaG90b3N5bnRoZXNpcw.._16-h3u}

**Photosynthesis** is the process that uses energy from the sun,
together with carbon dioxide and water, to make glucose and oxygen. The
primary role of photosynthesis is to make the carbohydrate, suggesting
that oxygen, which is released back into the atmosphere, is just a waste
product.

You can think of a single leaf as a photosynthesis factory. A factory
has specialized machines to produce a product. It’s also connected to a
transportation system that supplies it with raw materials and carries
away the finished product. In all these ways, a leaf resembles a
factory. The cross section of a leaf in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTEyLWxlYWYtc3RydWN0dXJlcw..) lets you
look inside a leaf “factory.”

**Figure 10.41**

There’s more to a leaf than meets the eye. Can you identify the
functions of each of the labeled structures in the diagram?

</div>

A leaf consists of several different kinds of specialized tissues that
work together to make food by photosynthesis. The major tissues are
mesophyll, veins, and epidermis.

-   **Mesophyll** makes up most of the leaf’s interior. This is where
    photosynthesis occurs. Mesophyll consists mainly of parenchymal
    cells with chloroplasts.
-   **Veins** are made primarily of xylem and phloem. They transport
    water and minerals to the cells of leaves and carry away
    dissolved sugar.
-   The **epidermis** of the leaf consists of a single layer of
    tightly-packed dermal cells. They secrete waxy cuticle to prevent
    evaporation of water from the leaf. The epidermis has tiny pores
    called **stomata** (singular, stoma) that control **transpiration**
    and gas exchange with the air. For photosynthesis, stomata must
    control the transpiration of water vapor and the exchange of carbon
    dioxide and oxygen. Stomata are flanked by **guard cells** that
    swell or shrink by taking in or losing water through **osmosis** .
    When they do, they open or close the stomata (see **Figure**
    [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTEzLXN0b21hdGE.) ).

**Fertilization or pollination. How does this occur in the plant?**

Pollination. A significant step in the life cycle of flowering plants.
But fertilization must occur in the life cycles of all plants, not just
those with flowers. Does it always use the birds or the bees?

### General Plant Life Cycle {#10.html#x-ck12-R2VuZXJhbCBQbGFudCBMaWZlIEN5Y2xl_17-a7k}

The life cycle of all plants is complex because it is characterized by
alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte
and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual and asexual
reproduction. The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually gives
plants the flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Their complex
life cycle allows for great variation. A general plant **life cycle** is
represented by the diagram in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTE2LXBsYW50LWxpZmUtY3ljbGU.) . From the
figure, you can see that the diploid **sporophyte** has a structure
called a **sporangium** (plural, sporangia) that undergoes meiosis to
form haploid **spores** . A spore develops into a haploid
**gametophyte** . The gametophyte has male or female reproductive organs
that undergo mitosis to form haploid **gametes** (sperm or eggs).
Fertilization of gametes produces a diploid **zygote** . The zygote
grows and develops into a mature sporophyte, and the cycle repeats.

**Figure 10.43**

This diagram represents the life cycle that generally characterizes
plants.

</div>

One of the two generations of a plant’s life cycle is typically dominant
to the other generation. Whether it’s the sporophyte or gametophyte
generation, individuals in the dominant generation live longer and grow
larger. They are the green, photosynthetic structures that you would
recognize as a fern, tree, or other plant (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTE3LWRvbWluYW50LWdlbmVyYXRpb24.) ).
Individuals in the nondominant generation, in contrast, may be very
small and rarely seen. They may live in or on the dominant plant.

The dominant generation in nonvascular plants is the gametophyte; in
vascular plants, it’s the sporophyte. Why is a dominant sporophyte
generation an advantage on land?

**Haploid or diploid. Which would you say is dominant?**

That may depend on the plant. Start with moss. The typical nonvascular
plant. But such a simple plant has a very interesting life cycle.
Whereas most kinds of plants have two sets of chromosomes in their
vegetative cells, mosses have only a single set of chromosomes. So, how
does meiosis occur?

### Life Cycle of Nonvascular Plants {#10.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBDeWNsZSBvZiBOb252YXNjdWxhciBQbGFudHM._18-qst}

Nonvascular plants include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. They are
the only plants with a life cycle in which the gametophyte generation is
dominant. **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTE4LW1vc3MtbGlmZS1jeWNsZQ..) shows the

**gametophytes** . The **sporophyte** generation is very small and
dependent on the gametophyte plant.

In order for fertilization to occur, sperm must swim in a drop of water

place, it results in a **zygote** that develops into a tiny sporophyte
on the parent gametophyte plant. The sporophyte produces haploid
**spores** , and these develop into the next generation of gametophyte
plants. Then the cycle repeats.

**What's a fiddlehead?**

This fern leaf structure is known as a fiddlehead. Can you understand
why? Does it look tasty? Nearly all ferns have fiddleheads, and many
recipes exist on how to prepare fiddleheads. But this part of the plant,
the leaf or the frond, also plays a very important role in the fern's
life cycle.

In the life cycle of a fern, the sporophyte generation is dominant.

</div>

A mature sporophyte fern has the familiar leafy **fronds** . The
undersides of the leaves are dotted with clusters of **sporangia** .
Sporangia produce spores that develop into tiny, heart-shaped
**gametophytes** . Gametophytes have **antheridia** and **archegonia** .
Antheridia produce sperm with many cilia; archegonia produce eggs.
Fertilization occurs when sperm swim to an egg inside an **archegonium**
. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo that becomes a new
sporophyte plant. Then the cycle repeats.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-nqp}

-   In vascular plants, the sporophyte generation is dominant.
-   In seedless vascular plants such as ferns, the sporophyte releases
    spores from the undersides of leaves.
-   The spores develop into tiny, separate gametophytes, from which the
    next generation of sporophyte plants grows.

**Do pine trees produce flowers?**

Of course not. But look closely at these pine cones. Notice the shape.
Can you see the "petals?" They do seem oddly similar to flowers. These
pine cones have a prominent role in the gymnosperm life cycle. So what
is the function of a pine cone?

### Life Cycle of Gymnosperms {#10.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBDeWNsZSBvZiBHeW1ub3NwZXJtcw.._20-dg3}

**Gymnosperms** are vascular plants that produce seeds in **cones** .
Examples include **conifers** such as pine and spruce trees. The
gymnosperm life cycle has a dominant **sporophyte** generation. Both
**gametophytes** and the next generation’s new sporophytes develop on
the sporophyte parent plant. **Figure**

**Figure 10.48**

The gymnosperm life cycle follows the general plant life cycle, but with
some new adaptations. Can you identify them?

</div>

Cones form on a mature sporophyte plant. Inside male cones, male spores
develop into male gametophytes. Each male gametophyte consists of
several cells enclosed within a grain of **pollen** . Inside female
cones, female spores develop into female gametophytes. Each female
gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule.

Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from a male to female
cone. If sperm then travel from the pollen to an egg so fertilization
can occur, a diploid zygote results. The zygote develops into an embryo
within a seed, which forms from the ovule inside the female cone. If the
seed germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte tree, which
repeats the cycle.

### Summary {#10.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-1yh}

-   In gymnosperms, the gametophyte generation takes place in a cone,
    which forms on the mature sporophyte plant.
-   Each male gametophyte is just a few cells inside a grain of pollen.
    Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule.
-   Pollination must occur for fertilization to take place. Zygotes
    develop into embryos inside seeds, from which the next sporophyte

**What's the most successful type of plant?**

Flowering plants. Why? As you know, flowers come in many different
styles and colors, and many are visually pleasing. This aids in
pollination. Also notice the anatomy of this Hibiscus flower. Each part
has evolved to play a role in the life cycle.

### Life Cycle of Angiosperms {#10.html#x-ck12-TGlmZSBDeWNsZSBvZiBBbmdpb3NwZXJtcw.._21-n9m}

**Angiosperms** , or flowering plants, are the most abundant and diverse
plants on Earth. Angiosperms evolved several reproductive adaptations
that have contributed to their success. Like all vascular plants, their
life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte generation. A typical
angiosperm life cycle is shown in **Figure**

</div>

The flower in **Figure**
[above](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTIyLWFuZ2lvc3Blcm0tbGlmZS1jeWNsZQ..) is
obviously an innovation in the angiosperm life cycle. **Flowers** form
on the dominant **sporophyte** plant. They consist of highly specialized
male and female reproductive organs. Flowers produce **spores** that
develop into **gametophytes** . Male gametophytes consist of just a few
cells within a **pollen** grain and produce sperm. Female gametophytes
produce eggs inside the ovaries of flowers. Flowers also attract animal
**pollinators** .

If pollination and fertilization occur, a diploid zygote forms within an
ovule in the ovary. The zygote develops into an embryo inside a seed,
which forms from the ovule and also contains food to nourish the embryo.
The ovary surrounding the seed may develop into a fruit. **Fruits**
attract animals that may disperse the seeds they contain. If a seed
germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte plant and repeat the
cycle.

**Look closely at the petals of this flower. Do they look different?**

This flower is from an aloe plant. Aloes are succulent plants, which
have adaptations that allow them to store water in their enlarged fleshy
leaves, stems, or roots. This allows them to survive in arid
environments.

### Plant Adaptations {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgQWRhcHRhdGlvbnM._22-ydw}

Plants live just about everywhere on Earth. To live in so many different
habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and
reproduce under a diversity of conditions.

All plants are adapted to live on land. Or are they? All living plants
today have terrestrial ancestors, but some plants now live in the water.
They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat.

##### Adaptations to Water {#10.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnMgdG8gV2F0ZXI._22-unt}

Aquatic plants are plants that live in water. Living in water has
certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water.
There’s plenty of it and it’s all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants
do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving
water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root
systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticles on leaves. Support is also
less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result,
adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not
necessary for most aquatic plants.

Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one
thing, pollination by wind or animals isn’t feasible under water, so
aquatic plants may have adaptations that help them keep their flowers
above water. For instance, water lilies have bowl-shaped flowers and
broad, flat leaves that float. This allows the lilies to collect the
maximum amount of sunlight, which does not penetrate very deeply below
the water's surface. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams
and rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, cattails have
narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to the moving
water (see **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTIzLWNhdHRhaWxzLXdhdGVyLWxpbGllcy1jb21wb3NpdGU.)
).

**Figure 10.50**

Water lilies and cattails have different adaptations for life in the
water. Compare the leaves of the two kinds of plants. How do the leaves
help the plants adapt to their watery habitats?

</div>

##### Adaptations to Extreme Dryness {#10.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnMgdG8gRXh0cmVtZSBEcnluZXNz_22-v9e}

Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite
problem: how to get and keep water. Plants that are adapted to very dry
environments are called **xerophytes** . Their adaptations may help them
increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when it is
available.

The saguaro cactus pictured in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTI0LXNhZ3Vhcm8.) has adapted in all
three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches
high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet)
from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more
widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible
from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesn’t have any leaves to lose water
by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store
a lot of water. Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might
try to get at the water inside.

</div>

##### Adaptations to Air {#10.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnMgdG8gQWly_22-ifc}

Plants called **epiphytes** grow on other plants. They obtain moisture
from the air and make food by photosynthesis. Most epiphytes are ferns
or orchids that live in tropical or temperate rainforests (see
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTI1LWVsa2hvcm4tZmVybg..) ).
Host trees provide support, allowing epiphyte plants to obtain air and
sunlight high above the forest floor. Being elevated above the ground
lets epiphytes get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can
get enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce
the risk of being eaten by herbivores and increase the chance of
pollination by wind.

These Elkhorn and Staghorn ferns are growing on a rainforest tree as
epiphytes.

</div>

Epiphytes don’t grow in soil, so they may not have roots. However, they
still need water for photosynthesis. Rainforests are humid, so the
plants may be able to absorb the water they need from the air. However,
many epiphytes have evolved modified leaves or other structures for
collecting rainwater, fog, or dew. The leaves of the bromeliad shown in
**Figure** [below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTI2LWJyb21lbGlhZA..) are
rolled into funnel shapes to collect rainwater. The base of the leaves
forms a tank that can hold more than 8 liters (2 gallons) of water. Some
insects and amphibians may spend their whole life cycle in the pool of
water in the tank, adding minerals to the water with their wastes. The
tissues at the base of the leaf are absorbent, so they can take in both
water and minerals from the tank.

**So what happens to a vineyard in the middle of winter?**

The vines cannot die each year. Instead, the plants go into a state of
dormancy, almost as if they are taking a long nap.

### Plant Responses {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgUmVzcG9uc2Vz_23-eqs}

Like all organisms, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their
environment. Unlike animals, plants can’t run, fly, or swim toward food
or away from danger. They are usually rooted to the soil. Instead, a
plant’s primary means of response is to change how it is growing. Plants
also don’t have a nervous system to control their responses. Instead,
their responses are generally controlled by **hormones** , which are
chemical messenger molecules.

#### Plant Tropisms {#10.html#x-ck12-UGxhbnQgVHJvcGlzbXM._23-bql}

Plant roots always grow downward because specialized cells in root caps
detect and respond to gravity. This is an example of a tropism. A
**tropism** is a turning toward or away from a stimulus in the
environment. Growing toward gravity is called **geotropism** . Plants
also exhibit **phototropism** , or growing toward a light source. This
response is controlled by a plant growth hormone called **auxin** . As
shown in **Figure**
[below](#10.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE2LTI3LXBob3RvdHJvcGlzbQ..) , auxin
stimulates cells on the dark side of a plant to grow longer. This causes
the plant to bend toward the light.

Phototropism is controlled by the growth hormone auxin.

</div>

#### Daily and Seasonal Responses {#10.html#x-ck12-RGFpbHkgYW5kIFNlYXNvbmFsIFJlc3BvbnNlcw.._23-ga5}

Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness.
For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect
sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss.
Environmental stimuli that indicate changing seasons trigger other
responses. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall
by going **dormant** . They suspend growth and development in order to
survive the extreme cold and dryness of winter. **Dormancy** ensures
that seeds will germinate and plants will grow only when conditions are
favorable.

#### Responses to Disease {#10.html#x-ck12-UmVzcG9uc2VzIHRvIERpc2Vhc2U._23-gji}

Plants don’t have immune systems, but they do respond to disease.
Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding
infected tissue. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants
also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens. For example, willow
trees produce salicylic acid to kill bacteria. The same compound is used
in many acne products for the same reason. Exciting new research
suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other plants
of threats to their health, allowing the plants to prepare for their own
defense. As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in
place, but they are far from helpless.

#### KQED: Plant Plague: Sudden Oak Death {#10.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogUGxhbnQgUGxhZ3VlOiBTdWRkZW4gT2FrIERlYXRo_23-wvq}

nonvascular plants to towering redwood trees. It is probable that
without plants, most life, including us, would not exist. Why?
Photosynthesis. This process brings energy into our ecosystems and
produces the oxygen that all our cells need. This concept discusses the
types of plants, the structures of plants, the life cycles of plants,
and the adaptations and responses of plants.

**What traits do all animals share? And is their behavior innate or
learned?**

There is great variation among species that make up the animal kingdom.
Some of this variation is shown in the figure above. Despite the
variation, there are a number of traits that are shared by all animals.
The fact that all animals have certain traits in common shows that they
share a common ancestor. Characteristics, classification, and behavior
of animals will be addressed in the *Animals* chapter.

**Is an insect an animal?**

Of course it is. Is a snail an insect? No, snails are mollusks. Notice
the large "foot" that allows movement, and the antennas are obvious.
Actually, a snail's eyes are on the two long projections on its head,
and the projections are called eyestalks. These are characteristics of
this animal.

### Characteristics of Animals {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEFuaW1hbHM.-pma}

**Animals** are a kingdom of multicellular eukaryotes. They cannot make
their own food. Instead, they get nutrients by eating other living
things. Therefore, animals are **heterotrophs** .

#### Animal Cells {#11.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsIENlbGxz-iyp}

Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other
membrane-bound organelles (see **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTAyLWFuaW1hbC1jZWxs) ). Unlike the
cells of plants and fungi, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives
animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes so they
can become specialized to do particular jobs. The human nerve cell shown
in **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTAzLWh1bWFuLW5lcnZlLWNlbGw.) is a good
example. Its shape suits its function of transmitting nerve impulses
over long distances. A nerve cell would be unable to take this shape if
it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall.

Human Nerve Cell. A human nerve cell is specialized to transmit nerve

</div>

#### Animal Structure and Function {#11.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsIFN0cnVjdHVyZSBhbmQgRnVuY3Rpb24.-ys5}

Animals not only have specialized cells. Most animals also have tissues
and organs. In many animals, organs form organ systems, such as a
nervous system. Higher levels of organization allow animals to perform
many complex functions. What can animals do that most other living
things cannot? Most animals share these characteristics: **sensory
organs** , **movement** , and **internal digestion** . All of them are
illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTA0LWFuaW1hbC1jaGFyYWN0ZXJpc3RpY3M.) .

-   Animals can detect environmental stimuli, such as light, sound,
    and touch. Stimuli are detected by sensory nerve cells. The
    information is transmitted and processed by the nervous system. The
    nervous system, in turn, may direct the body to respond. *Animal
    Eyes* at [http://www.surenmanvelyan.com/eyes/animal-eyes/]() has 26
    images of the eyes of various animals.
-   All animals can move, at least during some stage of their
    life cycle. Muscles and nerves work together to allow movement.
    Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates.
    It also helps them escape from predators.
-   Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals
    consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to
    digest them. (Many other organisms absorb nutrients directly from
    the environment.)

#### Animal Life Cycle and Reproduction {#11.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsIExpZmUgQ3ljbGUgYW5kIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg..-zub}

Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life
cycle is shown in **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTA1LWFuaW1hbC1saWZlLWN5Y2xl) . Most
animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just
about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to
produce sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg
fuse. The zygote that forms develops into an embryo. The embryo
eventually develops into an adult.

**Plant or animal?**

Animal. What type? Now that is a good question. This azure vase sponge
is an animal, but how is it classified? It is estimated that there are
easily over a million species of animals on Earth. How are all these
species divided into their various classifications?

### Classification of Animals {#11.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQW5pbWFscw.._1-yie}

All animals share basic traits. But animals also show a lot of
diversity. They range from simple sponges to complex humans.

#### Major Animal Phyla {#11.html#x-ck12-TWFqb3IgQW5pbWFsIFBoeWxh_1-u7l}

Members of the animal kingdom are divided into more than 30 phyla.
**Table** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YW5pbWFsLXBoeWxh) lists the
nine phyla with the greatest number of species. Each of the animal phyla
listed in the table has at least 10,000 species.

<div id="11.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YW5pbWFsLXBoeWxh">

[![](images/table.png)](table_11-1.html)

**Click on the image above to view the table**

</div>

#### Invertebrate vs. Vertebrate {#11.html#x-ck12-SW52ZXJ0ZWJyYXRlIHZzLiBWZXJ0ZWJyYXRl_1-sli}

The first eight phyla listed in **Table**
[above](#11.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YW5pbWFsLXBoeWxh) include only
invertebrate animals. **Invertebrates** are animals that lack a
**vertebral column** , or **backbone** . The last phylum in the table,
the Chordata, also includes many invertebrate species. Tunicates and
lancelets are both invertebrates. Altogether, invertebrates make up at
least 95 percent of all animal species. The remaining animals are
vertebrates. **Vertebrates** are animals that have a backbone. All
vertebrates belong to the phylum **Chordata** . They include fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-zit}

-   Vertebrates have a backbone, but invertebrates do not.
-   Except for the chordates, all animal phyla consist only
    of invertebrates.
-   Chordates include both vertebrates and invertebrates.

**What is this elephant doing?**

Obviously he is spraying the zebras with water. Why? Is this elephant
playing or is there another reason he is spraying the zebras? The
elephant is actually trying to keep the zebras away from the waterhole.
This is considered an animal behavior.

### Animal Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-QW5pbWFsIEJlaGF2aW9y_2-o84}

Did you ever see a dog sit on command? Have you ever watched a cat
trying to catch a mouse? These are just two examples of the many
behaviors of animals. **Animal behavior** includes all the ways that
animals interact with each other and the environment. Examples of common

Examples of Animal Behavior. Can you think of other examples of animal
behavior besides the three shown here?

</div>

The branch of biology that studies animal behavior is called
**ethology** . Ethologists usually study how animals behave in their
natural environment, rather than in a lab. They generally try to answer
four basic questions about the behaviors they observe:

1.  What causes the behavior? What is the **stimulus** , or trigger, for
    the behavior? What structures and functions of the animal are
    involved in the behavior?
2.  How does the behavior develop? Is it present early in life? Or does
    it appear only as the animal matures? Are certain experiences needed
    for the behavior to develop?
3.  Why did the behavior evolve? How does the behavior affect the
    fitness of the animal performing it? How does it affect the survival
    of the species?
4.  How did the behavior evolve? How does it compare with similar
    behaviors in related species? In what ancestor did the behavior
    first appear?

### Evolution of Animal Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEFuaW1hbCBCZWhhdmlvcg.._2-ixr}

To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they may evolve
through natural selection. If behaviors increase **fitness** , they are
likely to become more common over time. If they decrease fitness, they
are likely to become less common.

#### Nature vs. Nurture {#11.html#x-ck12-TmF0dXJlIHZzLiBOdXJ0dXJl_2-vn0}

Some behaviors seem to be controlled solely by genes. Others appear to
be due to experiences in a given environment. Whether behaviors are
controlled mainly by genes or by the environment is often a matter of
debate. This is called the **nature-nurture debate** . Nature refers to
the genes an animal inherits. Nurture refers to the environment that the
animal experiences.

In reality, most animal behaviors are not controlled by nature or
nurture alone. Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture.
In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a
certain way is probably controlled by genes. However, the normal
behaviors can’t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs. A puppy
raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal
behaviors. It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward
them.

#### How Behaviors Evolve {#11.html#x-ck12-SG93IEJlaGF2aW9ycyBFdm9sdmU._2-qst}

It’s easy to see how many common types of behavior evolve. That’s
because they obviously increase the fitness of the animal performing
them. For example, when wolves hunt together in a pack, they are more
likely to catch prey (see **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTIxLXdvbHZlcy1odW50aW5n) ). Therefore,
hunting with others increases a wolf’s fitness. The wolf is more likely
to survive and pass its genes to the next generation by behaving this
way.

![Wolves hunting together in
pack](ck12_11_files/20150914105120440448.jpeg "Wolves hunting together in pack")

**Figure 11.6**

Wolves hunt together in packs. This is adaptive because it increases
their chances of killing prey and obtaining food.

</div>

The evolution of certain other types of behavior is not as easy to
explain. An example is a squirrel chattering loudly to warn other
squirrels that a predator is near. This is likely to help the other
squirrels avoid the predator. Therefore, it could increase their
fitness. But what about the squirrel raises the alarm? This squirrel is
more likely to be noticed by the predator. Therefore, the behavior may
actually lower this squirrel’s fitness. How could such a behavior evolve
through natural selection?

One possible answer is that helping others often means helping close
relatives. Close relatives share many of the same genes that they
inherited from their common ancestor. As a result, helping a close
relative may actually increase the chances that copies of one’s own
genes will be passed to the next generation. In this way, a behavior
that puts oneself at risk could actually increase through natural
selection. This form of natural selection is called **kin selection** .

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._2-fjc}

-   Most animal behaviors are controlled by both genes and experiences
    in a given environment.
-   To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they
    may evolve.
-   Behaviors that improve fitness increase through natural selection.

**Is this Blue-footed Booby actually dancing?**

The courtship of the Blue-footed Booby consists of the male flaunting
his blue feet and dancing to impress the female. During the dance, the
male will spread his wings and stamp his feet on the ground. Are these
birds born with this skill, or do they learn it?

### Innate Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-SW5uYXRlIEJlaGF2aW9y_3-oyk}

Behaviors that are closely controlled by genes with little or no
environmental influence are called **innate behaviors** . These are
behaviors that occur naturally in all members of a species whenever they
are exposed to a certain **stimulus** . Innate behaviors do not have to
be learned or practiced. They are also called instinctive behaviors. An
**instinct** is the ability of an animal to perform a behavior the first
time it is exposed to the proper stimulus. For example, a dog will drool
the first time—and every time—it is exposed to food.

#### Significance of Innate Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-U2lnbmlmaWNhbmNlIG9mIElubmF0ZSBCZWhhdmlvcg.._3-4iy}

Innate behaviors are rigid and predictable. All members of the species
perform the behaviors in the same way. Innate behaviors usually involve
basic life functions, such as finding food or caring for offspring.
Several examples are shown in **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTIyLWlubmF0ZS1iZWhhdmlvcg..) . If an
animal were to perform such important behaviors incorrectly, it would be
less likely to survive or reproduce.

#### Intelligence and Innate Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-SW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlIGFuZCBJbm5hdGUgQmVoYXZpb3I._3-zzc}

Innate behaviors occur in all animals. However, they are less common in
species with higher levels of intelligence. Humans are the most
intelligent species, and they have very few innate behaviors. The only
innate behaviors in humans are reflexes. A **reflex** is a response that
always occurs when a certain stimulus is present. For example, a human
infant will grasp an object, such as a finger, that is placed in its
palm. The infant has no control over this reaction because it is innate.
Other than reflexes such as this, human behaviors are learned–or at
least influenced by experience—rather than being innate.

#### Innate Behavior in Human Beings {#11.html#x-ck12-SW5uYXRlIEJlaGF2aW9y_3IGluIEh1bWFuIEJlaW5ncw..-btf}

All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of
human behaviors that do not have to be learned? Chances are, you will
have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in
humans are called **reflex behaviors** . They occur mainly in babies.
Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies
may help them survive.

An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex.
Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth.
It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of
a baby feeding and surviving. Another example of a reflex behavior in
babies is the grasp reflex ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xMi1odW1hbi1iYWJ5LWdyYXNw) ). Babies
instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their
grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior might
increase a baby’s chances of surviving?

**Fighting or playing?**

You might think that these young tigers are fighting, but they’re really
just playing. Like most other young mammals, tigers like to play. Why do
mammals play? Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other
purpose as well? Playing is actually an important way of learning. By
playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them become
successful predators as adults. Playing is just one of many ways that
mammals and other animals learn how to behave.

### Learned Behavior {#11.html#x-ck12-TGVhcm5lZCBCZWhhdmlvcg.._4-eyt}

**Learning** is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of
experience. Compared with innate behaviors, learned behaviors are more
flexible. They can be modified to suit changing conditions. This may
make them more adaptive than innate behaviors. For example, drivers may
have to modify how they drive (a learned behavior) when roads are wet or
icy. Otherwise, they may lose control of their vehicle.

Animals may learn behaviors in a variety of ways. Some ways are quite
simple. Others are more complex. Several types of learning are described
in **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTIzLWFuaW1hbC1sZWFybmluZw..) .

**Figure 11.9**

Types of Learning. Five different ways that animals may learn behaviors
are shown here. What have you learned in each of these ways?

</div>

#### Insight Learning {#11.html#x-ck12-SW5zaWdodCBMZWFybmluZw.._4-wlu}

**Insight learning** , which is based on past experience and reasoning,
is a hallmark of the human animal. Humans have used insight learning to
solve problems ranging from starting a fire to traveling to the moon. It
usually involves coming up with new ways to solve problems. Insight
learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden flash of
insight. Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human
beings use insight learning more than any other species. They have used
their intelligence to solve problems ranging from inventing the wheel to
flying rockets into space.

Think about problems you have solved. Maybe you figured out how to solve
a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video
game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it,
then you were using insight learning.

One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems.
Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent
enough to make tools. In fact, tool-making was believed to set humans
apart from all other animals.

In 1960, primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also
make tools. She saw a chimpanzee strip leaves from a twig. Then he poked
the twig into a hole in a termite mound. After termites climbed onto the
twig, he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to
it. The chimpanzee had made a tool to “fish” for termites. He had used
insight to solve a problem. Since then, chimpanzees have been seen
making several different types of tools. For example, they sharpen
sticks and use them as spears for hunting. They use stones as hammers to
crack open nuts.

Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to
solve problems. A crow was seen bending a piece of wire into a hook.
Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube.

An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below (
**Figure** [below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0xOS1nb3JpbGxhLXRvb2wtdXNl)
). Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals can use
their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through
insight.

**Playing or fighting?**

This display of aggression may be over a mate or land. But they
definitely are not playing. This fight will continue until one is badly
injured and flees, or the fight may continue to the death.

### Social Behaviors {#11.html#x-ck12-U29jaWFsIEJlaGF2aW9ycw.._5-wf2}

Different types of behavior evolved in animals because the behaviors
helped them survive or reproduce. In many species, animals live together
in a close-knit group with other members of their species. Such a group
is referred to as a **society** . Animals that live in a society are
known as **social animals** . They live and work together for the good
of the group. This is called **cooperation** . Generally, each member of
the group has a specific role that it plays in the society. Cooperation
allows the group to do many things that a lone animal could never do.
Look at the ants in **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTI0LWluc2VjdC1jb29wZXJhdGlvbg..) . By
working together, they are able to carry a large insect back to the nest
to feed other members of their society.

</div>

#### Communication {#11.html#x-ck12-Q29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbg.._5-arx}

For individuals to cooperate, they need to **communicate** . Animals can
communicate with sounds, chemicals, or visual cues. For example, to
communicate with sounds, birds sing and frogs croak. Both may be
communicating that they are good mates. Ants communicate with chemicals
called **pheromones** . For example, they use the chemicals to mark
trails to food sources so other ants can find them. Male dogs use
pheromones in urine to mark their territory. They are “telling” other
dogs to stay out of their yard. You can see several examples of visual
communication in **Figure**

</div>

#### Aggression {#11.html#x-ck12-QWdncmVzc2lvbg.._5-gyb}

**Aggression** is behavior that is intended to cause harm or pain. It
may involve physical violence against other individuals. For example,
two male gorillas may fight and use their canine teeth to inflict deep
wounds. Expressing aggression this way may lead to serious injury and
even death.

In many species display behaviors, rather than actual physical attacks,
are used to show aggression. This helps prevent injury and death. Male
gorillas, for example, are more likely to put on a display of aggression
than to attack another male. In fact, gorillas have a whole series of
display behaviors that they use to show aggression. They beat on their
chest, dash back and forth, and pound the ground with their hands.

#### Competition {#11.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGV0aXRpb24._5-ang}

Aggressive behavior often occurs when individuals compete for the same
resources. Animals may compete for territory, water, food, or mates.
There are two basic types of competition: intraspecific and
interspecific.

-   **Intraspecific competition** occurs between members of the
    same species. For example, two male deer may compete for mates by
    clashing their antlers together.
-   **Interspecific competition** occurs between members of
    different species. For example, one species of ant may attack and
    take over the colony of another ant species.

### Summary {#11.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-vfi}

-   Types of animal behavior include social behaviors such as
    cooperation and communication.
-   Competition may lead to aggressive behaviors or displays
    of aggression.

**The seventh greatest wonder in the world. Really?**

The Masai Mara Wildebeest Migration. The annual wildebeest migration in
Kenya and Tanzania is arguably the most spectacular natural event in
Africa. More than 3 million large mammals have made the vast Masai Mara
and Serengeti plains their home, and each summer they migrate, looking
for greener pastures. And yes, some call it "the seventh greatest wonder
in the world."

### Cyclic Behaviors {#11.html#x-ck12-Q3ljbGljIEJlaGF2aW9ycw.._6-ap8}

Many animal behaviors occur in a regular cycle. Two types of cyclic
behaviors are circadian rhythms and migration.

**Circadian rhythms** are regular changes in biology or behavior that
occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and
body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day.
Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have
daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after
dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many
species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny
structure called the **biological clock** . This structure is located in
a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to
the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body
processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the
biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours.

**Migration** refers to seasonal movements of animals from one area to
another. Migrants typically travel long distances, and travel the same
paths each seasonal cycle. Usually, the migrants move to another area in
order to find food or mates. Many birds, fish, and insects migrate.
Mammals such as whales and caribou migrate as well. **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTI2LWdvZHdpdC1taWdyYXRpb24.) shows the
migration route of a bird called a godwit. Another example of a behavior
with a yearly cycle is hibernation. **Hibernation** is a state in which
an animal’s body processes are slower than usual, and its body
temperature falls. An animal uses less energy than usual during
hibernation. This helps the animal survive during a time of year when
food is scarce. Hibernation may last for weeks or months. Animals that
hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes. Most people
think that bears hibernate. In fact, bears do not go into true
hibernation. In the winter, they go into a deep sleep. However, their
body processes do not slow down very much. Their body temperature also
remains about the same as usual. Bears can be awakened easily from their
winter sleep.

For thousands of years and countless generations, migratory birds have
flown the same long-distance paths between their breeding and feeding
grounds. Understanding the routes these birds take, called **flyways** ,
helps conservation efforts and gives scientists better knowledge of
global changes, both natural and man-made. See *The Great Migration* at

**So when does the peacock extend his tail?**

Peafowl are best known for the male's extravagant tail. Obviously
though, a peacock cannot have his tail extended continuously. It would
make it very difficult to move around. And it may be very tiring. So
when does the peacock extend his tail? The peacock displays his tail as
part of courtship.

#### Mating and Courtship {#11.html#x-ck12-TWF0aW5nIGFuZCBDb3VydHNoaXA._7-h10}

**Mating** refers to the union of a male and female of the same species
for reproduction. The relationship between mates varies by species.
Adults may have many mates, or they may mate with just one individual.
Mates may stay together only while mating, for an entire breeding
season, or even for life.

Females are likely to be more selective than males in choosing mates. In
many species, males put on **courtship** displays to encourage females
to choose them as mates. For example, to attract a mate, a male
bowerbird builds an elaborate nest decorated with hundreds of small blue
objects (see **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTI3LWJvd2VyYmlyZC1uZXN0) ).

Bowerbird Decorating His Nest. A male bowerbird spends many hours
collecting bits of blue glass and other small blue objects to decorate
his nest. A female bowerbird inspects the nests of many males before
choosing as a mate the male with the best nest.

</div>

#### Parental Care {#11.html#x-ck12-UGFyZW50YWwgQ2FyZQ.._7-p8r}

In most species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles, parents provide no
care to their offspring. In birds and mammals, on the other hand,
parental care is common. Most often, the mother provides the care.
However, in some species, both parents or just the father may be
involved.

Parental care is generally longest and most involved in mammals. Besides
feeding and protecting their offspring, parents may teach their
offspring skills they will need to survive on their own. For example,
meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat scorpions. They show the pups
how to safely handle the poisonous insects and how to remove the
stingers.

#### Defending Territory {#11.html#x-ck12-RGVmZW5kaW5nIFRlcnJpdG9yeQ.._7-mlf}

Some species of animals are **territorial** . This means that they
defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and
enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely
to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Animals
generally do not defend their territory by fighting. Instead, they are
more likely to use display behavior. The behavior tells other animals to
stay away. It gets the message across without the need for fighting.
Display behavior is generally safer and uses less energy than fighting.
Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory. They pound
on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male
gorillas to keep away from their area. The robin displays his red breast
to warn other robins to stay away ( **Figure**
[below](#11.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNS0yOS1yZWQtcm9iaW4tY2hlc3Q.) ).

The red breast of this male robin is easy to see. The robin displays his
bright red chest to defend his territory. It warns other robins to keep

</div>

Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory.
This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects. Cats may
also mark their territory by depositing chemicals. They have scent
glands in their face. They deposit chemicals by rubbing their face
against objects.

**Why does not having a backbone make things so complex?**

Invertebrates could be described as simple animals. And though some are
very simple, the vastness of the invertebrate species makes this group
of animals anything but simple. Characteristics, evolution, and
classification of invertebrates will be discussed in the *Invertebrates*
chapter.

**What type of animal is a Sea Cucumber?**

That is a Sea Cucumber, and it is an animal. The Sea Cucumber is a
soft-bodied invertebrate that is related to the starfish and sea
urchins. There are over 1,100 species that are found worldwide in
intertidal zones as well as deep waters.

### Characteristics of Invertebrates {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIEludmVydGVicmF0ZXM.-t7e}

The majority of animals today are invertebrates. They have a wide range
of physical traits and ways of life. Modern invertebrates include
animals as different as the sponge and tarantula. Why are both of these
animals classified as invertebrates? What traits do they have common?

**Figure 12.1**

Examples of Invertebrates. Both a sponge (left) and tarantula (right)
are invertebrates. Can you identify any traits they share?

</div>

One trait **invertebrates** like the sponge and tarantula share is lack
of a backbone. In fact, they don’t have any bones at all. These are
defining traits of all invertebrates. Some invertebrates have a
skeleton, but it isn’t made of bone. Many other traits of invertebrates
show considerable diversity.

#### Digestion {#12.html#x-ck12-RGlnZXN0aW9u-nnr}

Invertebrates have one of two types of digestive system: an incomplete
or complete digestive system. Both are shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTEzLXR3by10eXBlcy1vZi1pbnZlcnRlYnJhdGUtZGlnZXN0aXZlLXN5c3RlbXM.)
. An **incomplete digestive system** consists of a digestive cavity with
one opening. The single opening serves as both mouth and anus. A
**complete digestive system** consists of a digestive tract with two
openings. One opening is the mouth. The other is the anus.

incomplete digestive system, found in a jellyfish; on the right is the
complete digestive system of a roundworm. Invertebrates may have either
of these two types of digestive system. Find the parts of each digestive
system in each drawing. How do the two systems differ?

</div>

#### Movement {#12.html#x-ck12-TW92ZW1lbnQ.-wtr}

All invertebrates can move on their own during at least some stage of
their life cycle. However, they may differ in how they move. Several
ways are described below.

-   Some invertebrates are simply carried along by water currents. They
    cannot control their movement in a particular direction. An example
    is a jellyfish.
-   Other invertebrates can contract muscles to move independently of
    water currents or on solid surfaces. They can also control the
    direction in which they move. An example is a roundworm. It can move
    forward and to the left or right.
-   Still other invertebrates have specialized **appendages**
    for movement. For example, they may have jointed legs for walking or
    climbing or wings for flying. An example is an insect such as a fly.

#### Nervous System {#12.html#x-ck12-TmVydm91cyBTeXN0ZW0.-gmq}

Most invertebrates have a **nervous system** . The nervous system allows
them to sense and respond to their environment. The simplest
invertebrate nervous system is just a network of nerves that can sense
touch, called a **nerve net** (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE0LW5lcnZlLW5ldA..) ). Most
invertebrates have a more complex nervous system. It may include a
**brain** and several different sense organs.

</div>

#### Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-UmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u-6tu}

Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. Diploid adults produce haploid
gametes (sperm and eggs). In some species, the same individuals produce
both sperm and eggs. In other species, sperm and eggs are produced by
separate male and female individuals. Fertilization occurs when a sperm
and an egg fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into an
embryo and eventually into a new adult organism. On the way, it may pass
through one or more larval stages. A **larva** (plural, larvae) is a
juvenile, or immature, stage of an animal. It is generally quite
different in form and function from the adult form of the species. For
example, the larva may be able to swim freely, whereas the adult must
remain permanently attached to a solid surface.

Some invertebrates can also reproduce asexually. This may occur by
fission or budding. **Fission** takes place when an animal simply
divides into two parts. Each part then regrows the missing part. The
result is two whole organisms. **Budding** may take place when a parent
forms a small bump, or bud. The bud remains attached to the parent while
it develops into a new individual.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-drc}

-   The majority of living animals are invertebrates. Invertebrates lack
    a backbone.
-   Invertebrates may have an incomplete or a complete digestive system.
-   Invertebrates vary in how they move and in the complexity of their
    nervous system.
-   Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. After hatching, many
    invertebrates pass through one or more larval stages that are
    different from the adult stage.

**How many different types of beetles are there?**

There are about 350,000 species of beetles spread all over the world.
But let's focus on this one. Look at the detail on this Rhinoceros
beetle. The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season,
and for digging. The body of an adult rhino beetle is covered by a thick
exoskeleton. A pair of thick wings lay atop another set of wings
underneath, allowing the rhinoceros beetle to fly. Compare those
evolutionary adaptations to a simple sponge, and the evolutionary
significance of invertebrates becomes obvious.

### Invertebrate Evolution {#12.html#x-ck12-SW52ZXJ0ZWJyYXRlIEV2b2x1dGlvbg.._1-mba}

Invertebrates evolved several important traits before vertebrates even
appeared. These traits are now found in just about all animals.

#### Multicellularity {#12.html#x-ck12-TXVsdGljZWxsdWxhcml0eQ.._1-iyg}

The first animal trait to evolve was **multicellularity** . This was
highly adaptive. Multiple cells could do different jobs. They could
evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do their job really
well. However, the first invertebrates still lacked tissues. Sponges
represent the first organism at the multicellular stage of invertebrate
evolution.

#### Tissues {#12.html#x-ck12-VGlzc3Vlcw.._1-zf1}

Living cnidarians, such as jellyfish, represent the next stage of
invertebrate evolution. This was the evolution of tissues. It was the
first step in the evolution of organs and organ systems. At first,
invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers.
There was an outer cell layer called **ectoderm** and an inner cell
layer called **endoderm.** The two cell layers allowed different types
of tissues to form.

#### Radial Symmetry {#12.html#x-ck12-UmFkaWFsIFN5bW1ldHJ5_1-u1z}

Another trait that evolved early on was **symmetry** . To understand
symmetry, you need to see an animal that lacks symmetry. A sponge, like
the one in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE1LWludmVydGVicmF0ZS1zeW1tZXRyeQ..) ,
lacks symmetry. This means it cannot be divided into two identical
halves. A symmetrical organism, in contrast, can be divided into two
identical halves. Both the coral polyp and the beetle in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE1LWludmVydGVicmF0ZS1zeW1tZXRyeQ..)
have symmetry.

![Symmetry in
invertebrates](ck12_12_files/20150914105203184200.jpeg "Symmetry in invertebrates")

**Figure 12.4**

Symmetry in Invertebrates. Sponges lack symmetry. Radial symmetry
evolved first. This was followed by bilateral symmetry. How do the two
types of symmetry differ?

</div>

The coral polyp in **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE1LWludmVydGVicmF0ZS1zeW1tZXRyeQ..)
has **radial symmetry.** This was the first type of symmetry to evolve.
The coral has a distinct top and bottom but not distinct ends. It can be
divided into identical halves like a pie, but not into right and left
halves. Animals with radial symmetry have no sense of directions such as
forward and backward or left and right. This makes controlled movement
in these directions impossible.

#### Cephalization {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2VwaGFsaXphdGlvbg.._1-edo}

Flatworms represent the next stage of invertebrate evolution. They
evolved **cephalization.** This is the concentration of nerve tissue at
one end of the body, forming a head region. This is highly adaptive. It
allows central control of the entire organism. Cephalization was first
step in the evolution of a brain.

#### Bilateral Symmetry {#12.html#x-ck12-QmlsYXRlcmFsIFN5bW1ldHJ5_1-azf}

An outcome of cephalization was **bilateral symmetry.** This is
demonstrated by the beetle in **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE1LWludmVydGVicmF0ZS1zeW1tZXRyeQ..) .
With concentrated nerve tissue at the head but not at the tail end, the
two ends of the body are distinct from each other. The animal can be
divided down the middle to form identical right and left halves. It
allows the animal to tell front from back and left from right. This is
needed for controlled movements in these directions.

#### Mesoderm {#12.html#x-ck12-TWVzb2Rlcm0._1-fds}

Ancestors of flatworms also evolved **mesoderm.** This is a third layer
of cells between the ectoderm and the endoderm (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE2LWZsYXR3b3JtLWNlbGwtbGF5ZXJz) ).
Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of
tissues, such as muscle.

</div>

#### Complete Digestive System {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGxldGUgRGlnZXN0aXZlIFN5c3RlbQ.._1-acj}

Early invertebrates had an incomplete digestive system. There was just
one opening for the mouth and anus. Ancestors of modern roundworms were
the first animals to evolve a **complete digestive system** . With a
separate mouth and anus, food could move through the body in just one
direction. This made digestion more efficient. An animal could keep
eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste. Different parts of
the digestive tract could also become specialized for different
digestive functions. This led to the evolution of digestive organs.

#### Pseudocoelom and Coelom {#12.html#x-ck12-UHNldWRvY29lbG9tIGFuZCBDb2Vsb20._1-tnh}

Ancestors of roundworms also evolved a **pseudocoelom.** This is a
partial body cavity that is filled with fluid. It allows room for
internal organs to develop. The fluid also cushions the internal organs.
The pressure of the fluid within the cavity provides stiffness. It gives
the body internal support, forming a **hydrostatic skeleton.** It
explains why roundworms are round and flatworms are flat. Later, a true
**coelom** evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity, completely
enclosed by mesoderm. It lies between the digestive cavity and body wall
(see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE3LWludmVydGVicmF0ZS1jb2Vsb20.) ).
Invertebrates with a true coelom include mollusks and annelids.

the mesoderm.

</div>

#### Segmented Body {#12.html#x-ck12-U2VnbWVudGVkIEJvZHk._1-ebl}

**Segmentation** evolved next. This is a division of the body into
multiple segments. Both the earthworm and ant pictured in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE4LXNlZ21lbnRlZC1pbnZlcnRlYnJhdGVz)
have segmented bodies. This trait increases flexibility. It permits a
wider range of motion. All annelids and arthropods are segmented.
Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages. For example, they evolved
jointed legs for walking and “feelers” (antennae) for sensing.

segments. Notice the ants jointed legs and “feelers.”

</div>

#### Notochord {#12.html#x-ck12-Tm90b2Nob3Jk_1-7i6}

Some invertebrates evolved a **notochord** . This is the stiff support
rod in a **chordate** . The first chordates were probably similar to
modern invertebrate chordates. The sea squirt in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTE5LXNlYS1zcXVpcnQtbm90b2Nob3Jk) is an
example. Later, some invertebrate chordates evolved into vertebrates.

**Invertebrate, arthropod or insect?**

This Monarch caterpillar is an invertebrate. It is also an insect and an
arthropod. Of all the animal species, it is estimated that well over 90%
are invertebrates. Of all invertebrates, the insects are by far the most
numerous. There are so many species of insects that scientists have yet
to discover them all, let alone name or count them. Estimates of the
total number of insect species fall in the range of 1 to 30 million. So,
it helps if there are methods to classify not just the insects, but all
invertebrates.

### Classification of Invertebrates {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgSW52ZXJ0ZWJyYXRlcw.._2-ied}

Eight major phyla contain the majority of invertebrate species.

#### Protostomes and Deuterostomes {#12.html#x-ck12-UHJvdG9zdG9tZXMgYW5kIERldXRlcm9zdG9tZXM._2-hm3}

Most invertebrates (and higher animals) can be placed in one of two
groups based on how they develop as embryos. The two groups are called
**protostomes** and **deuterostomes** . As shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE3LTIwLXByb3Rvc29tZXMtZGV1dGVyb3NvbWVz) ,
organisms in the two groups have different ways of forming the coelom
and mouth, among other differences.

Mollusks, annelids, and arthropods are protostomes. Echinoderms and
chordates are deuterostomes. This distinction is important. Why does it
matter? It shows that echinoderms are more closely related to chordates
than are the other invertebrate phyla. This is not apparent based on
other, more obvious traits.

**So what exactly is a sponge?**

Here we have a giant barrel sponge. How can something that looks like
that be considered an *animal?* Where's the head? Where are the legs?
Where's the mouth?

### Sponges {#12.html#x-ck12-U3Bvbmdlcw.._3-8ms}

Invertebrates are animals without a backbone. They are the most numerous
animals on Earth. Most invertebrates are insects. However, simpler
invertebrates evolved before insects. Some, like the sponges you will
read about in this concept, have existed virtually unchanged for
hundreds of millions of years. Their continued existence is evidence
that they are well adapted for their habitats. They also evolved some of
the most important traits that are found in almost all animals today.
Without the traits that evolved in sponges and other simple
invertebrates, you would not exist. Sponges are aquatic invertebrates
that make up the phylum **Porifera.** The word "porifera" means
pore-bearing. The phylum is aptly named. As you can see from **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAxLXNwb25nZS13aXRoLXBvcmVz) , a sponge
has a porous body. There are at least 5,000 living species of sponges.
Almost all of them inhabit the ocean, living mainly on coral reefs or
the ocean floor. See *The First Animal* at
[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/origins.html](origins.html)
for an introduction to sponges.

#### Structure and Function of Sponges {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBTcG9uZ2Vz_3-9za}

Sponges come in a variety of shapes and sizes. For example, they may be
shaped like tubes, fans, cones, or just blobs. They range in diameter
from about a centimeter (0.4 inches) to over a meter (3.3 feet). Many
species live in colonies that may be quite large. Adult sponges are
**sessile.** This means they are unable to move from place to place.
Root-like projections anchor them to solid surfaces such as rocks and
reefs.

Sponges have an internal skeleton that gives them support and
protection. An internal skeleton is called an **endoskeleton.** A sponge
endoskeleton consists of short, sharp rods called **spicules** (see
**Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAyLXNwb25nZS1hbmF0b215) ).
Spicules are made of silica, calcium carbonate, or **spongin** , a tough

**Figure 12.11**

Sponge Anatomy. A sponge lacks tissues and organs, but it has several
types of specialized cells.

</div>

Sponges are **filter feeders.** They pump water into their body through
their pores. The water flows through a large central cavity called the
**spongocoel** (see **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAyLXNwb25nZS1hbmF0b215) ). As the
water flows by, specialized **collar cells** (which are also known as
choanocytes) filter out food particles such as bacteria. Collar cells
have tiny hairs that trap the particles. They also have a flagellum that
whips the water and keeps it moving. Once the food is trapped, the
collar cells digest it (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTAzLWNvbGxhci1jZWxs) ). Cells called
amebocytes also help digest the food. They distribute the nutrients to
the rest of the body as well. Finally, the water flows back out of the
body through an opening called the **osculum** . As water flows through
the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponge’s cells. The
cells also expel wastes into the water for removal through the osculum.

#### Sponge Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-U3BvbmdlIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._3-zmb}

Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction
occurs by budding. **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA0LXNwb25nZS1saWZlLWN5Y2xl) shows the
sponge life cycle when sexual reproduction is involved. Adult sponges
produce eggs and sperm. In many species, the same individuals produce
both. However, they don’t produce eggs and sperm at the same time. As a
result, self-fertilization is unlikely to occur. What is an advantage of
avoiding self-fertilization?

**Figure 12.13**

The sponge life cycle includes sexual reproduction. Sponges may also
reproduce asexually.

</div>

Sperm are released into the surrounding water through the osculum. If
they enter a female sponge through a pore, they may be trapped by collar
cells. Trapped sperm are delivered to eggs inside the female body, where
fertilization takes place. The resulting zygote develops into a larva.
Unlike the adult, the larva is motile. It is covered with cilia that
propel it through the water. As the larva grows, it becomes more similar
to an adult sponge and loses its ability to swim.

#### Ecology of Sponges {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBTcG9uZ2Vz_3-zjn}

Sponges that live on coral reefs have symbiotic relationships with other
reef species. They provide shelter for algae, shrimp, and crabs. In
return, they get nutrients from the metabolism of the organisms they
shelter. Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish. Because
sponges are sessile, they cannot flee from predators. Their sharp
spicules provide some defense. They also produce toxins that may poison
predators that try to eat them.

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._3-dwq}

-   Sponges are aquatic invertebrates. They make up the phylum Porifera.
-   Sponges have specialized cells and an endoskeleton.
-   Sponges lack tissues and body symmetry.
-   Adult sponges are sessile filter feeders.
-   Sponge larvae have cilia for swimming.

**The sea anemone. Plant or animal?**

It may look like a plant, but it's not. Sea anemones are a group of
water-dwelling, predatory animals in the phylum Cnidaria. A sea anemone
is a polyp attached at the bottom to the surface beneath it. They can
have anywhere from a few tens of tentacles to a few hundred tentacles.
And they eat small fish and shrimp.

### Cnidarians {#12.html#x-ck12-Q25pZGFyaWFucw.._4-bvs}

**Cnidarians** are invertebrates such as jellyfish and corals. They
belong to the phylum Cnidaria. All cnidarians are aquatic. Most of them
live in the ocean. Cnidarians are a little more complex than sponges.
They have radial symmetry and tissues. There are more than 10,000
cnidarian species. They are very diverse, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA1LWNuaWRhcmlhbi1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) . See

#### Structure and Function of Cnidarians {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBDbmlkYXJpYW5z_4-tfd}

All cnidarians have something in common. It’s a nematocyst, like the one
shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA2LW5lbWF0b2N5c3Q.) . A **nematocyst**
is a long, thin, coiled stinger. It has a barb that may inject poison.
These tiny poison "darts" are propelled out of special cells. They are
used to attack prey or defend against predators.

There are two basic body plans in cnidarians. They are called the polyp
and medusa. Both are shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA3LWNuaWRhcmlhbi1ib2R5LXBsYW5z) . The
**polyp** has a tubular body and is usually sessile. The **medusa**
(plural, **medusae** ) has a bell-shaped body and is typically motile.
Some cnidarian species alternate between polyp and medusa forms. Other
species exist in just one form or the other.

**Figure 12.16**

Cnidarian Body Plans. Cnidarians may exist in the polyp (left) or medusa
(right) form.

</div>

The body of a cnidarian consists of two cell layers, ectoderm and
endoderm. The cells surround a digestive cavity called the
**coelenteron** (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA4LWNuaWRhcmlhbi1saWZlLWN5Y2xl) ).
Cnidarians have a simple digestive system. The single opening is
surrounded by tentacles, which are used to capture prey. The tentacles
are covered with nematocyst cells. Digestion takes place in the
coelenteron. Nutrients are absorbed and gases exchanged through the
cells lining this cavity. Fluid in the coelenteron creates a hydrostatic
skeleton.

Cnidarians have a simple nervous system consisting of a **nerve net**
that can detect touch. They may also have other sensory structures. For
example, jellyfish have light-sensing structures and gravity-sensing
structures. These senses give them a sense of up versus down. It also
helps them balance.

#### Cnidarian Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-Q25pZGFyaWFuIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._4-ejl}

**Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA4LWNuaWRhcmlhbi1saWZlLWN5Y2xl) shows
a general cnidarian life cycle. Polyps usually reproduce asexually. One
type of asexual reproduction in polyps leads to the formation of new
medusae. Medusae usually reproduce sexually. Sexual reproduction forms a
zygote. The zygote develops into a larva called a **planula** . The
planula, in turn, develops into a polyp. There are many variations on
the general life cycle. Obviously, species that exist only as polyps or
medusae have a life cycle without the other form.

</div>

#### Ecology of Cnidarians {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBDbmlkYXJpYW5z_4-mit}

Cnidarians can be found in almost all ocean habitats. They may live in
water that is shallow or deep, warm or cold. A few species live in
freshwater. Some cnidarians live alone, while others live in colonies.

Corals form large colonies in shallow tropical water. They are confined
to shallow water because they have a mutualistic relationship with algae
that live inside them. The algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, so
they must be relatively close to the surface of the water. Corals exist
only as polyps. They catch plankton with their tentacles. Many secrete a
calcium carbonate exoskeleton. Over time, this builds up to become a
coral reef (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTA5LWdyZWF0LWJhcnJpZXItcmVlZg..) ).
Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many ocean organisms. They also
help protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing some of the energy of
waves. Coral reefs are at risk of destruction today.

Unlike corals, jellyfish spend most of their lives as medusae. They live
virtually everywhere in the ocean. They are typically carnivores. They
prey on zooplankton, other invertebrates, and the eggs and larvae of
fish.

Jellyfish. They are otherworldly creatures that glow in the dark,
without brains or bones, some more than 100 feet long. And there are
many different types. Jellyfish are free-swimming members of the phylum
Cnidaria. Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the
deep sea. To find out more about jellyfish, see

**Would you believe that this gold-dotted creature is a flatworm?**

No? Well it is. There are more than 25,000 different types of flatworms,
so they can be very different in how they appear. And many don't even
look like your typical worm.

### Flatworms {#12.html#x-ck12-RmxhdHdvcm1z_5-q0v}

**Flatworms** belong to the phylum **Platyhelminthes.** Examples of
flatworms are shown in **Figure**

#### Structure and Function of Flatworms {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBGbGF0d29ybXM._5-znd}

Flatworms range in length from about 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) to more
than 20 meters (66 feet). They have a flat body because they do not have
a coelom or even a pseudocoelom. They also lack a respiratory system.
Instead, their cells exchange gases by diffusion directly with the
environment. They have an incomplete digestive system.

Flatworms reflect several major evolutionary advances in invertebrates.
They have three embryonic cell layers, including mesoderm. The mesoderm
layer allows them to develop organ systems. For example, they have
muscular and excretory systems. The muscular system allows them to move
from place to place over solid surfaces. The excretory system lets them
maintain a proper balance of water and salts. Flatworms also show
cephalization and bilateral symmetry.

#### Flatworm Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-RmxhdHdvcm0gUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_5-rp1}

Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals
produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized
eggs pass out of the adult’s body and hatch into larvae. There may be
several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into
the adult form, and the life cycle repeats.

#### Ecology of Flatworms {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBGbGF0d29ybXM._5-zii}

Both flukes and tapeworms are parasites with vertebrate hosts, including
human hosts. Flukes live in the host’s circulatory system or liver.
Tapeworms live in the host’s digestive system. Usually, more than one
type of host is required to complete the parasite’s life cycle. Look at
the life cycle of the liver fluke in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTExLWxpdmVyLWZsdWtl) . As an adult, the
fluke has a vertebrate host. As a larva, it has an invertebrate host. If
you follow the life cycle, you can see how each host becomes infected so
the fluke can continue its life cycle.

</div>

Tapeworms and flukes have suckers and other structures for feeding on a
host. Tapeworms also have a **scolex** , a ring of hooks on their head
to attach themselves to the host (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTEyLXRhcGV3b3Jt) ). Unlike other
invertebrates, tapeworms lack a mouth and digestive system. Instead,
they absorb nutrients directly from the host’s digestive system with
their suckers.

Not all flatworms are parasites. Some are free-living carnivores. They
eat other small invertebrates and decaying animals. Most of the
free-living species live in aquatic habitats, but some live in moist
soil.

**When most people picture a worm, do they picture a roundworm?**

Actually, they do not. Whereas flatworms are flat, roundworms obviously
appear round. With over 80,000 species, there are plenty of different
types of roundworms. But these are still not the types of worms most
people picture when they think of worms.

### Roundworms {#12.html#x-ck12-Um91bmR3b3Jtcw.._6-en9}

**Roundworms** make up the phylum **Nematoda** . This is a very diverse
animal phyla. It has more than 80,000 known species.

#### Structure and Function of Roundworms {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBSb3VuZHdvcm1z_6-c3f}

Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters
(23 feet) in length. As their name suggests, they have a round body.
This is because they have a **pseudocoelom** . This is one way they
differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system.
It allows them to take in food, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at
the same time.

Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their
body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of
fluid pressure in the pseudocoelom. As a result, roundworms have a
hydrostatic skeleton. This provides a counterforce for the contraction
of muscles lining the pseudocoelom. This allows the worms to move
efficiently along solid surfaces.

#### Roundworm Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-Um91bmR3b3JtIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._6-9ve}

Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate
male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female
organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000
per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the
cycle repeats.

#### Ecology of Roundworms {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBSb3VuZHdvcm1z_6-htv}

Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic. Free-living worms are found
mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in soil. They generally feed on
bacteria, fungi, protozoans, or decaying organic matter. By breaking
down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle.

Parasitic roundworms may have plant, vertebrate, or invertebrate hosts.
Several species have human hosts. For example, hookworms, like the one
in **Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTEzLWhvb2t3b3Jt) , are
human parasites. They infect the human intestine. They are named for the
hooks they use to grab onto the host’s tissues. Hookworm larvae enter
the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they
mature into adults. Adults lay eggs, which pass out of the host in
feces. Then the cycle repeats.

Hookworm Parasite. Hookworms like this one are common human parasites.

</div>

Tiny pinworms are the most common roundworm parasites of people in the
U.S. In some areas, as many as one out of three children are infected.
Humans become infected when they ingest the nearly microscopic pinworm
eggs. The eggs hatch and develop into adults in the host’s digestive
tract. Adults lay eggs that pass out of the host’s body to continue the
cycle. Pinworms have a fairly simple life cycle with only one host.

**Fish or squid?**

Neither. This is a mollusk, a cuttlefish to be specific. What is a
mollusk? Well, to start, mollusks are aquatic species that are not fish.
There are over 100,000 different mollusks, so there are bound to be some
interesting looking organisms, like this one.

### Mollusks {#12.html#x-ck12-TW9sbHVza3M._7-dek}

Have you ever been to the ocean or eaten seafood? If you have, then you
probably have encountered members of the phylum **Mollusca** . Mollusks
include snails, scallops, and squids, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE0LW1vbGx1c2stY29tcG9zaXRl) . There
are more than 100,000 known species of mollusks. About 80 percent of
mollusk species are gastropods. See *The Biological Arms Race* at
[http://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/survival.html](survival.html)
for an introduction to mollusks.

#### Structure and Function of Mollusks {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBNb2xsdXNrcw.._7-1my}

Mollusks are a very diverse phylum. Some mollusks are nearly
microscopic. The largest mollusk, a colossal squid, may be as long as a
school bus and weigh over half a ton! The basic body plan of a mollusk
is shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE1LW1vbGx1c2stYm9keS1wbGFu) . The main
distinguishing feature is a hard outer shell. It covers the top of the
body and encloses the internal organs. Most mollusks have a distinct
head region. The head may have tentacles for sensing the environment and
grasping food. There is generally a muscular foot, which may be used for
walking. However, the foot has evolved modifications in many species to
be used for other purposes.

**Figure 12.24**

Basic Mollusk Body Plan. The basic body plan shown here varies among
mollusk classes. For example, several mollusk species no longer have
shells. Do you know which ones?

</div>

Two unique features of mollusks are the mantle and radula (see
**Figure** [above](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE1LW1vbGx1c2stYm9keS1wbGFu)
). The **mantle** is a layer of tissue that lies between the shell and
the body. It secretes calcium carbonate to form the shell. It forms a
cavity, called the **mantle cavity** , between the mantle and the body.
The mantle cavity pumps water for filter feeding. The **radula** is a
feeding organ with teeth made of chitin. It is located in front of the
mouth in the head region. Herbivorous mollusks use the radula to scrape
food such as algae off rocks. Predatory mollusks use the radula to drill
holes in the shells of their prey.

Mollusks have a coelom and a complete digestive system. Their excretory
system consists of tube-shaped organs called **nephridia** (see
**Figure** [above](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE1LW1vbGx1c2stYm9keS1wbGFu)
). The organs filter waste from body fluids and release the waste into
the coelom. Terrestrial mollusks exchange gases with the surrounding
air. This occurs across the lining of the mantle cavity. Aquatic
mollusks “breathe” under water with gills. **Gills** are thin filaments
that absorb gases and exchange them between the blood and surrounding
water.

Mollusks have a circulatory system with one or two hearts that pump
blood. The **heart** is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the
circulatory system when its muscles contract. The circulatory system may
be open or closed, depending on the species.

The major classes of mollusks vary in structure and function. You can
read about some of their differences in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE2LWNsYXNzZXMtb2YtbW9sbHVza3M.) .

#### Mollusk Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-TW9sbHVzayBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._7-y6x}

Mollusks reproduce sexually. Most species have separate male and female
sexes. Gametes are released into the mantle cavity. Fertilization may be
internal or external, depending on the species. Fertilized eggs develop
into larvae. There may be one or more larval stages. Each one is
different from the adult stage. Mollusks have a unique larval form
called a **trochophore** . It is a tiny organism with cilia for
swimming.

#### Ecology of Mollusks {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBNb2xsdXNrcw.._7-pwu}

Mollusks live in most terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats.
However, the majority of species live in the ocean. They can be found in
both shallow and deep water and from tropical to polar latitudes.
Mollusks are a major food source for other organisms, including humans.
You may have eaten mollusks such as clams, oysters, scallops, or
mussels.

The different classes of mollusks have different ways of obtaining food.

-   **Gastropods** may be herbivores, predators, or internal parasites.
    They live in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Marine species
    live mainly in shallow coastal waters. Gastropods use their foot to
    crawl slowly over rocks, reefs, or soil, looking for food.
-   **Bivalves** are generally sessile filter feeders. They live in both
    freshwater and marine habitats. They use their foot to attach
    themselves to rocks or reefs or to burrow into mud. Bivalves feed on
    plankton and nonliving organic matter. They filter the food out of
    the water as it flows through their mantle cavity.
-   **Cephalopods** are carnivores that live only in marine habitats.
    They may be found in the open ocean or close to shore. They are
    either predators or scavengers. They generally eat other
    invertebrates and fish.

#### KQED: Cool Critters: Dwarf Cuttlefish {#12.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogQ29vbCBDcml0dGVyczogRHdhcmYgQ3V0dGxlZmlzaA.._7-fey}

What's the coolest critter in the ocean under 4 inches long? The Dwarf
Cuttlefish! Cuttlefish are marine animals that belong to the class
Cephalopoda. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but mollusks.
Recent studies indicate that cuttlefish are among the most intelligent
invertebrates, with one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
invertebrates. Cuttlefish have an internal shell called the
**cuttlebone** and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with suckers,
with which they secure their prey. For more information on the
cuttlefish, see

#### KQED: The Fierce Humboldt Squid {#12.html#x-ck12-S1FFRDogVGhlIEZpZXJjZSBIdW1ib2xkdCBTcXVpZA.._7-2tf}

The Humboldt squid is a large, predatory invertebrate found in the
waters of the Pacific Ocean. A mysterious sea creature up to 7 feet
long, with 10 arms, a sharp beak and a ravenous appetite, packs of
fierce Humboldt Squid attack nearly everything they see, from fish to
scuba divers. Traveling in groups of 1,000 or more and swimming at
speeds of more than 15 miles an hour, these animals hunt and feed
together, and use jet propulsion to shoot out of the water to escape
predators. Humboldt squid live at depths of between 600 and about 2,000
feet, coming to the surface at night to feed. They live for
approximately two years and spend much of their short life in the
ocean's oxygen-minimum zone, where very little other life exists.
Because they live at such depths, little is known about these mysterious
sea creatures. The Humboldt squid usually lives in the waters of the
Humboldt Current, ranging from the southern tip of South America north
to California, but in recent years, this squid has been found as far
north as Alaska. Marine biologists are working to discover why they have
headed north from their traditional homes off South America. See

**How can this be an animal?**

This is a worm. And even though it is blue, this is a Christmas tree
worm. These "Christmas tree" structures are actually specialized mouth
appendages. Each spiral is composed of feather-like tentacles which are
heavily ciliated. These appendages trap prey and transport the food
straight towards the worm's mouth. And these worms are annelids.

### Annelids {#12.html#x-ck12-QW5uZWxpZHM._8-ldd}

The phylum **Annelida** is made up of segmented worms such as
**earthworms** . Segmented worms are divided into many repeating
segments. There are roughly 15,000 species of annelids. Most belong to
one of three classes. A species in each class is pictured in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE3LWNsYXNzZXMtb2YtYW5uZWxpZHM.) . See

**Figure 12.26**

Classes of Annelids. The majority of annelids are polychaetes. They live
on the ocean floor, so you may not be familiar with them.

</div>

#### Structure and Function of Annelids {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBBbm5lbGlkcw.._8-0mh}

Annelids range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 3 meters.
They never attain the large size of some mollusks. Like mollusks,
however, they have a coelom. In fact, the annelid coelom is even larger,
allowing greater development of internal organs. Annelids have other
similarities with mollusks, including:

-   A closed circulatory system (like cephalopods).
-   An excretory system consisting of tubular nephridia.
-   A complete digestive system.
-   A brain.
-   Sensory organs for detecting light and other stimuli.
-   Gills for gas exchange (but many exchange gas through their skin).

The **segmentation** of annelids is highly adaptive. For one thing, it
allows more efficient movement. Each segment generally has its own nerve
and muscle tissues. Thus, localized muscle contractions can move just
those segments needed for a particular motion. Segmentation also allows
an animal to have specialized segments to carry out particular
functions. This allows the whole animal to be more efficient. Annelids
have the amazing capacity to regrow segments that break off. This is
called **regeneration.**

Annelids have a variety of structures on the surface of their body for
movement and other functions. These vary, depending on the species.
Several of the structures are described in **Figure**

#### Annelid Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-QW5uZWxpZCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._8-bqk}

Most species of annelids can reproduce both asexually and sexually.
However, leeches can reproduce only sexually. Asexual reproduction may
occur by budding or fission. Sexual reproduction varies by species.

-   In some species, the same individual produces both sperm and eggs.
    But worms mate to exchange sperm, rather than self-fertilizing their
    own eggs. Fertilized eggs are deposited in a mucous cocoon.
    Offspring emerge from the cocoon looking like small adults. They
    grow to adult size without going through a larval stage.
-   In polychaete species, there are separate sexes. Adult worms go
    through a major transformation to develop reproductive organs. This
    occurs in many adults at once. Then they all swim to the surface and
    release their gametes in the water, where fertilization takes place.
    Offspring go through a larval stage before developing into adults.

#### Ecology of Annelids {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBBbm5lbGlkcw.._8-kfm}

Annelids live in a diversity of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial
habitats. They vary in what they feed on and how they obtain their food.

-   Earthworms are **deposit feeders.** They burrow through the ground,
    eating soil and extracting organic matter from it. Earthworm feces,
    called worm casts, are very rich in plant nutrients. Earthworm
    burrows help aerate soil, which is also good for plants.
-   **Polychaetes** live on the ocean floor. They may be sedentary
    filter feeders, active predators, or scavengers. Active species
    crawl along the ocean floor in search of food.
-   **Leeches** are either predators or parasites. As predators, they
    capture and eat other invertebrates. As parasites, they feed off the
    blood of vertebrate hosts. They have a tubular organ, called a
    **proboscis** , for feeding.

#### Comparison of Worms {#12.html#x-ck12-Q29tcGFyaXNvbiBvZiBXb3Jtcw.._8-er1}

The following table compares the three worm phyla ( **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Q29tcGFyaXNvbi1vZi10aHJlZS13b3JtLXBoeWxh)
).

  **Phylum**        **Common Name**   **Body Cavity**   **Segmented**   **Digestive System**   **Example**

  Platyhelminthes   Flatworm          No                No              Incomplete             Tapeworm
  Nematoda          Roundworm         Yes               No              Complete               Heartworm
  Annelida          Segmented worm    Yes               Yes             Complete               Earthworm

### Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-tzy}

-   Annelids are segmented worms such as earthworms and leeches.
-   Annelids have a coelom, closed circulatory system, excretory system,
    and complete digestive system. They also have a brain.
-   Earthworms are important deposit feeders that help form and
    enrich soil.
-   Leeches are either predators or parasites. Parasitic leeches feed
    off the blood of vertebrate hosts.

**What has more species than any other animal phylum?**

Arthropods are not only the largest phylum of invertebrates. They are by
far the largest phylum of the animal kingdom. Roughly 80 percent of all
animal species living on Earth today are arthropods. Obviously,
arthropods have been extremely successful. What accounts for their
success?

### Arthropods {#12.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aHJvcG9kcw.._9-bm4}

There are more than a million known species of arthropods. There may
actually be ten times that many. **Arthropods** include insects,
spiders, lobsters, and centipedes. The arthropods pictured in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTE5LWFydGhyb3BvZC1kaXZlcnNpdHk.) give
just a hint of the phylum’s diversity. See *From Water to Land* at

### Structure and Function of Arthropods {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBBcnRocm9wb2Rz_9-8fj}

Arthropods range in length from about 1 millimeter to 4 meters (about 13
feet). They have a segmented body with a hard exoskeleton. They also
have jointed appendages. The body segments are the head, thorax, and
abdomen (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTIwLWFydGhyb3BvZC1ib2R5LXBsYW4.) ). In
some arthropods, the head and thorax are joined together as a
cephalothorax.

**Figure 12.29**

Arthropod Body Plan. Notice the three body segments of each organism.

</div>

The arthropod exoskeleton consists of several layers of cuticle. The
exoskeleton prevents water loss and gives support and protection. It
also acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The
exoskeleton doesn’t grow as the animal grows. Therefore, it must be shed
and replaced with a new one periodically through life. This is called
**molting** .

The jointed appendages of arthropods may be used as legs for walking.
Being jointed makes them more flexible. Try walking or climbing stairs
without bending your knees, and you’ll see why joints are helpful. In
most arthropods, the appendages on the head have been modified for other
functions. **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTIxLWFydGhyb3BvZC1oZWFk) shows some of
head appendages found in arthropods. Sensory organs such as eyes are
also found on the head.

**Figure 12.30**

Arthropod Head. Arthropods have evolved a variety of specialized
appendages and other structures on their head.

</div>

Some arthropods have special excretory structures. They are called
**coxal glands** and **Malpighian tubules** . Coxal glands collect and
concentrate liquid waste from blood. They excrete the waste from the
body through a pore. Malphigian tubules carry waste from the digestive
tract to the anus. The waste is excreted through the anus.

Like mollusks and annelids, aquatic arthropods may have gills to
exchange gases with the water (discussed below). Terrestrial arthropods,
on the other hand, have special respiratory structures to exchange gases
with the air. These are described in **Figure**

#### Underwater Spiders {#12.html#x-ck12-VW5kZXJ3YXRlciBTcGlkZXJz_9-nje}

In the ponds of northern Europe lives a tiny brown spider that spends
its entire life underwater. But just like land spiders, it needs oxygen
to breathe. So, how does this spider breath? Does it use book lungs? No.
In fact, aquatic spiders, known as "diving bell spiders," have gills.
Every so often, the spider leaves its underwater web to visit the
surface and bring back a bubble of air that sticks to its hairy abdomen.
It deposits the bubble into a little silk air tank. This "diving bell"
is a gill that sucks oxygen from the water, allowing the spider to stay
underwater for up to 24 hours. See
[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/06/spiders.html?ref=hp](spiders.html?ref=hp)
for additional information and additional pictures.

### Arthropod Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-QXJ0aHJvcG9kIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._9-wfc}

Arthropods have a life cycle with sexual reproduction. Most species go
through larval stages after hatching. The larvae are very different from
the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called
**metamorphosis** . This may take place within a cocoon. A familiar
example of metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva)
into a butterfly (adult). Other arthropod species, in contrast, hatch
young that look like small adults. These species lack both larval stages
and metamorphosis.

### Evolution of Arthropods {#12.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEFydGhyb3BvZHM._9-zmu}

The oldest known arthropods are **trilobites** . A fossil trilobite is
shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTIzLXRyaWxvYml0ZS1mb3NzaWw.) .
Trilobites were marine arthropods. They had many segments with paired
appendages for walking. As arthropods continued to evolve, segments
fused. Eventually, arthropods with three major segments evolved.
Appendages were also lost or modified during the course of arthropod
evolution.

arthropods. Trilobites first appeared more than 500 million years ago.
They lived for at least 200 million years before going extinct. They
left behind large numbers of fossils.

</div>

Arthropods were the first animals to live on land. The earliest
terrestrial arthropods were probably millipedes. They moved to land
about 430 million years ago. Early land arthropods evolved adaptations
such as book lungs or trachea to breathe air. The exoskeleton was
another important adaptation. It prevents an animal from drying out. It
also provides support in the absence of buoyant water.

### Classification of Arthropods {#12.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQXJ0aHJvcG9kcw.._9-79f}

Living arthropods are divided into four subphyla. They are described in
**Table** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YXJ0aHJvcG9kcw..) . The
Hexapoda subphylum includes mainly insects. There are so many insects
and they are so important that they are described in greater detail
below.

**What dominates life on Earth?**

Well, by numbers, it's not humans. This may look like a scary creature
from your worst nightmare, but it wouldn’t hurt a fly. In fact, it is a
fly! The picture shows the charming portrait of a horsefly, up close and
personal. Those big, striped, colorful orbs are its eyes. Did you ever
look through a kaleidoscope? If so, then you have an idea of what the
world looks like to a horsefly.

What other organs do insects like this horsefly have? Besides sensing
their environment, what other functions do their organs serve?

### Insects {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0cw.._10-yd0}

Most members of the subphylum **Hexapoda** are insects (class Insecta).
In fact, more than half of all known organisms are insects. There may be
more than 10 million insect species in the world, most of them yet to be
identified. It’s clear that insects, and not humans, dominate life on
Earth.

#### Structure and Function of Insects {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBJbnNlY3Rz_10-ush}

Insects range in length from less than a millimeter to about the length
of your arm. They can be found in most habitats, but they are mainly
terrestrial. Many can fly, so they are also aerial. Like other
arthropods, insects have a head, thorax, and abdomen. They have a wide
variety of appendages, including six legs attached to the thorax.

Insects have a pair of antennae for “smelling” and “tasting” chemicals.
Some insects can also use their antennae to detect sound. Other sensory
organs on the head include several simple eyes and a pair of compound
eyes. The **compound eyes** let insects see images. Butterflies and bees
can even see in color. For feeding, the head contains one pair of
**mandibles** and two pairs of **maxillae** . Insects consume a wide
range of foods, and their mouthparts have become specialized. Several
variations are shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI0LWluc2VjdC1tb3V0aHBhcnRz) .

adapted for different food sources. How do you think the different

</div>

An insect’s abdomen contains most of the internal organs. Like other
arthropods, insects have a complete digestive system. They also have an
open circulatory system and central nervous system. Like other
terrestrial arthropods, they have trachea for breathing air and
Malpighian tubules for excretion.

#### Insect Flight {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0IEZsaWdodA.._10-g2y}

The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to
fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly and were the first
animals to evolve flight. Flight has important advantages. It’s a
guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. It also aids in the
search for food and mates.

Insects generally have two pairs of wings for flight. Wings are part of
the exoskeleton and attached to the thorax. Insect wings show a lot of
variation. As you can see in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI1LWluc2VjdC13aW5ncw..) , butterfly
wings are paper-thin, whereas beetle wings are like armor. Not all
insect wings work the same way, either. They differ in how the muscles
are attached and whether the two pairs of wings work independently or
together. Besides flight, wings serve other functions. They may protect
the body (beetles), communicate visually with other insects
(butterflies), or produce sounds to attract mates (katydids).

#### Insect Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0IFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbg.._10-f9q}

Nearly all insects reproduce sexually. Some can also reproduce
asexually. An example of an insect life cycle is shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI2LWluc2VjdC1saWZlLWN5Y2xl) .

**Figure 12.36**

Insect Life Cycle. This diagram represents the life cycle of a mosquito.
Most insects have a similar life cycle.

</div>

When an insect egg hatches, a larva emerges. The larva eats and grows
and then enters the pupa stage. The **pupa** is immobile and may be
encased in a **cocoon** . During the pupa stage, the insect goes through
**metamorphosis** . Tissues and appendages of the larva break down and
reorganize into the adult form. How did such an incredible
transformation evolve? Metamorphosis is actually very advantageous. It
allows functions to be divided between life stages. Each stage can
evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without
affecting the adaptations of the other stage.

#### Insect Behavior {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0IEJlaGF2aW9y_10-wxv}

Insects are capable of a surprising range of behaviors. Most of their
behaviors, such as flying and mating, are instinctive. These are
behaviors that don’t need to be learned. They are largely controlled by
genes. However, some insect behaviors are learned. For example, ants and
bees can learn where food is located and keep going back for more.

Many species of insects have evolved complex social behaviors. They live
together in large, organized colonies (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI3LXRlcm1pdGUtbmVzdA..) ). This is
true of ants, termites, bees, and wasps. Colonies may include millions
of individual insects. Colony members divide up the labor of the colony.
Different insects are specialized for different jobs. Some reproduce,
while others care for the young. Still others get food or defend the
nest.

with chemicals called **pheromones** . For example, an ant deposits
pheromones on the ground as it returns to the nest from a food source.
It is marking the path so other ants can find the food. Honeybees
communicate by doing a “waggle dance.”

Most of us think ants are just pests. But not Brian Fisher. Known as
“The Ant Guy,” he's on a mission to show the world just how important
and amazing these little creatures are. In the process, he hopes to
catalog all of the world's 30,000 ant species before they become
casualties of habitat loss. See

Ladybugs, also known as ladybird beetles, have a life cycle of four to
six weeks. In one year as many as six generations of ladybird beetles
may hatch. In the spring, each adult female lays up to 300 eggs in small
clusters on plants where aphids are present. After a week the wingless
larvae hatch. Both the ladybird beetle larvae and adults are active
predators, eating only aphids, scales, mites and other plant-eating
insects. The ladybugs live on the vegetation where their prey is found,
which includes roses, oleander, milkweed and broccoli. Adult ladybugs
don’t taste very good. A bird careless enough to try to eat one will not
swallow it.

By late May to early June, when the larvae have depleted the food
supply, the adults migrate to the mountains. There, they eat mainly
pollen. The ladybugs gain fat from eating the pollen and this tides them
over during their nine-month hibernation. Thousands of adults hibernate
overwinter in tight clusters, called **aggregates** , under fallen
leaves and ground litter near streams. In the clear, warmer days of
early spring, the ladybugs break up the aggregates and begin several
days of mating. Learn about ladybugs at

#### Insects and Humans {#12.html#x-ck12-SW5zZWN0cyBhbmQgSHVtYW5z_10-dbm}

Most humans interact with insects every day. Many of these interactions
are harmless and often go unnoticed. However, insects cause humans a lot
of harm. They spread human diseases. For example, the deadly bubonic
plague of the middle ages was spread by fleas. Today, millions of people
die each year from malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes. Insects also
eat our crops. Sometimes they travel in huge swarms that completely
strip the land of all plant material (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI4LWxvY3VzdC1zd2FybQ..) ). On the
other hand, we depend on insects for the very food we eat. Without
insects to pollinate them, flowering plants—including many food
crops—could not reproduce.

Honeybees are one of the most well-known insects on the planet. Bees are
naturalized on every continent except Antarctica. Honeybees have a
highly developed social structure and depend on their community, or
colony, for survival, with a colony containing up to 20,000 bees. When
bees search plants for nectar, pollen sticks to the fuzzy hairs that
cover their hind legs. At the next flower, some of the pollen rubs off
and fertilizes that flower. In this way, bees help improve fruit
production. Bees pollinate an estimated 130 different varieties of
fruit, flowers, nuts and vegetables in the United States alone. Farmers
obviously depend on bees to pollinate crops, such as fruit and nuts, but
in recent years thousands of bee colonies have disappeared. This could
be a devastating issue for farmers. Can anything be done? Meet two
Northern California researchers looking for ways to make sure we always
have bees to pollinate crops at

**Believe it or not, this is an animal. See the mouth and arms?**

It is a sea lily, a crinoid echinoderm. Crinoids are essentially a mouth
on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. Although the
basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognized, most
crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids usually have a stem
used to attach themselves to a surface, but many become free-swimming as
adults.

### Echinoderms {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNoaW5vZGVybXM._11-xiv}

**Echinoderms** are marine organisms that make up the phylum
Echinodermata. They can be found in the ocean from the equator to the
poles. There are roughly 6000 living species of echinoderms. They are
among the most distinctive organisms within the animal kingdom. Members
of the phylum include sea stars (starfish), sand dollars, and feather
stars, shown in **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI5LWVjaGlub2Rlcm1z) . See “Different
But Equal” at

#### Structure and Function of Echinoderms {#12.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBvZiBFY2hpbm9kZXJtcw.._11-gqs}

Echinoderms are named for their “spiny skin.” However, the spines aren’t
on their skin. They are part of the endoskeleton. The endoskeleton
consists of calcium carbonate plates and spines, covered by a thin layer
of skin. Adult echinoderms have **radial symmetry** . This is easy to
see in the sea star and sand dollar in **Figure**
[above](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTI5LWVjaGlub2Rlcm1z) . However,
echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry. Evidence
for this is the bilateral symmetry of their larvae.

A unique feature of echinoderms is their **water vascular system** .
This is a network of canals that extend along each body part. In most
echinoderms, the canals have external projections called **tube feet**
(see **Figure** [below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTMwLXR1YmUtZmVldA..) ).
The feet have suckers on the ends. Muscle contractions force water into
the feet, causing them to extend outward. As the feet extend, they
attach their suckers to new locations, farther away from their previous
points of attachment. This results in a slow but powerful form of
movement. The suckers are very strong. They can even be used to pry open
the shells of prey.

**Figure 12.40**

Tube Feet of a Sea Star. The tube feet of a sea star (in white) are part
of its water vascular system. There is a sucker on the end of each foot
that allows the animal to “walk” slowly over a surface. The suckers are
strong enough to pry open shells.

</div>

Echinoderms lack respiratory and excretory systems. Instead, the thin
walls of their tube feet allow oxygen to diffuse in and wastes to
diffuse out. Echinoderms also lack a centralized nervous system. They
have an open circulatory system and lack a heart. On the other hand,
echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and a complete digestive
system. Echinoderms use pheromones to communicate with each other. They
detect the chemicals with sensory cells on their body surface. Some
echinoderms also have simple eyes ( **ocelli** ) that can sense light.
Like annelids, echinoderms have the ability to regenerate a missing body
part.

#### Echinoderm Reproduction {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNoaW5vZGVybSBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._11-0cv}

Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission, but most
echinoderms reproduce sexually. They generally have separate sexes and
external fertilization. Eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae. The larvae
undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form. During
metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry.

#### Echinoderm Classification {#12.html#x-ck12-RWNoaW5vZGVybSBDbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg.._11-giw}

Living echinoderms are placed in five classes. These five classes show
many similarities. Organisms in each class are described in **Table**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZWNoaW5vZGVybXM.) .

**Would you believe this animal eats its own brain?**

This is a sea squirt, which is a tunicate. Many physical changes occur
to the tunicate's body during metamorphosis into an adult, with one of
the most interesting being the digestion of the cerebral ganglion, which
controls movement and is the equivalent of the human brain. From this
comes the common saying that the sea squirt "eats its own brain."

### Invertebrate Chordates {#12.html#x-ck12-SW52ZXJ0ZWJyYXRlIENob3JkYXRlcw.._12-7bl}

Living species of chordates are classified into three major subphyla:
Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata. Vertebrates are all
chordates that have a backbone. The other two subphyla are invertebrate
chordates that lack a backbone. Members of the subphylum Urochordata are
**tunicates** (also called sea squirts). Members of the subphylum
Cephalochordata are **lancelets** . Both tunicates and lancelets are
small and primitive. They are probably similar to the earliest chordates
that evolved more than 500 million years ago.

#### Tunicates {#12.html#x-ck12-VHVuaWNhdGVz_12-dmj}

There are about 3,000 living species of tunicates (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTMzLXR1bmljYXRlcw..) ). They inhabit
shallow marine waters. Larval tunicates are free-swimming. They have all
four defining chordate traits (see the "Chordates" concept). Adult
tunicates are sessile. They no longer have a notochord or post-anal
tail.

**Figure 12.41**

</div>

Adult tunicates are barrel-shaped. They have two openings that siphon
water into and out of the body. The flow of water provides food for
filter feeding. Tunicates reproduce sexually. Each individual produces
both male and female gametes. However, they avoid self-fertilization.
Tunicates can also reproduce asexually by budding.

#### Lancelets {#12.html#x-ck12-TGFuY2VsZXRz_12-yei}

There are only about 25 living species of lancelets. They inhabit the
ocean floor where the water is shallow. Lancelet larvae are
free-swimming. The adults can swim but spend most of their time buried
in the sand. Like tunicates, lancelets are filter feeders. They take in
water through their mouth and expel it through an opening called the
**atriopore** (see **Figure**
[below](#12.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTM0LWxhbmNlbGV0cw..) ). Lancelets
reproduce sexually and have separates sexes.

## Summary {#12.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-rug}

Invertebrates describes eight invertebrate phyla with the greatest
number of species. From the simple sponge to the echinodermata, this
diverse group of organisms is anything but simple. Essentially, the only
common characteristic among all the groups is the lack of a backbone.
Many people may not even recognize the sponge as an animal. But it is.
And how many people think a worm is an insect? But it is not. Add to
this group all the different species of insects, and the diverseness of
this group is easily apparent.

**What's a chordate?**

Most chordates are animals with backbones. These range from small fish
to giant whales, from playful dogs to ferocious cats. Not nearly as
diverse as the invertebrates. But chordates do have many amazing
species. The white tiger ( *Panthera tigris* ) is a chordate. The tiger
is also from the class Mammalia, order Carnivora, and family Felidae,
meaning it is a meat-eating cat.

### Introduction to Chordates {#13.html#x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWN0aW9uIHRvIENob3JkYXRlcw..-rwd}

The phylum Chordata consists of both invertebrate and vertebrate
**chordates** . It is a large and diverse phylum. It includes some
60,000 species. Chordates range in length from about a centimeter to
over 30 meters (100 feet). They live in marine, freshwater, terrestrial,
and aerial habitats. They can be found from the equator to the poles.
Several examples of chordates are pictured in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTMxLWNob3JkYXRlLWRpdmVyc2l0eQ..) .

#### Characteristics of Chordates {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIENob3JkYXRlcw..-4m5}

Chordates have three embryonic cell layers. They also have a segmented
body with a coelom and bilateral symmetry. Chordates have a complete
digestive system and a closed circulatory system. Their nervous system
is centralized. There are four additional traits that are unique to
chordates. These four traits, shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE4LTMyLWNob3JkYXRlLWJvZHktcGxhbg..) ,
define the chordate phylum.

1.  **Post-anal tail** : The tail is opposite the head and extends past
    the anus.
2.  **Dorsal hollow nerve cord** : The nerve cord runs along the top, or
    dorsal, side of the animal. (In non chordate animals, the nerve cord
    is solid and runs along the bottom).
3.  **Notochord** : The notochord lies between the dorsal nerve cord and
    the digestive tract. It provides stiffness to counterbalance the
    pull of muscles.
4.  **Pharyngeal slits** : Pharyngeal slits are located in the pharynx.
    The pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and
    respiratory tracts.

**Figure 13.2**

post-anal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal

</div>

In some chordates, all four traits persist throughout life and serve
important functions. However, in many chordates, including humans, all
four traits are present only during the embryonic stage. After that,
some of the traits disappear or develop into other organs. For example,
in humans, pharyngeal slits are present in embryos and later develop
into the middle ear.

#### Classification of Chordates {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQ2hvcmRhdGVz-jfd}

Living species of chordates are classified into three major subphyla:
Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata. **Vertebrates** are all
chordates that have a backbone. The other two subphyla are invertebrate
chordates that lack a backbone.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-klh}

-   Chordates include vertebrates and invertebrates that have
    a notochord.
-   Chordates also have a post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and
    pharyngeal slits.
-   Vertebrate chordates have a backbone.

**What traits set this animal apart from invertebrate chordates?**

This small colorful fish is a vertebrate - it has a backbone. And
vertebral columns first evolved in fish. Think about the invertebrate
chordates. They live in the ocean, so it only makes sense that fish
would be the first true vertebrates. Vertebrates are a subphylum of the
phylum Chordata. Like all chordates, vertebrates have a notochord, a
dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. What
other characteristics do vertebrates have?

### Characteristics of Vertebrates {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIFZlcnRlYnJhdGVz_1-4m7}

The main distinguishing feature of vertebrates is their **vertebral
column** , or **backbone** (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTAxLWh1bWFuLXZlcnRlYnJhbC1jb2x1bW4tdmVydGVicmFl)
). The backbone runs from the head to the tail along the dorsal (top)
side of the body. The vertebral column is the core of the
**endoskeleton** . It allows a vertebrate to hold its shape. It also
houses and protects the spinal (nerve) cord that passes through it. The
vertebral column is made up of repeating units called **vertebrae**
(singular, **vertebra** ). In many species, there are shock-absorbing
discs between the vertebrae to cushion them during movement.

See *Vertebrates* at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT\_y1jOoaXc](watch?v=IT_y1jOoaXc) for
additional information.

#### Vertebrate Endoskeleton {#13.html#x-ck12-VmVydGVicmF0ZSBFbmRvc2tlbGV0b24._1-a5t}

Another distinguishing feature of vertebrates is an endoskeleton made of
bone or cartilage. **Cartilage** is a tough tissue that contains a
protein called collagen. **Bone** is a hard tissue that consists of a
collagen matrix, or framework, filled in with minerals such as calcium.
Bone is less flexible than cartilage but stronger. An endoskeleton made
of bone rather than cartilage allows animals to grow larger and heavier.
Bone also provides more protection for soft tissues and internal organs.

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTAyLXZlcnRlYnJhdGUtZW5kb3NrZWxldG9ucw..)
, the vertebrate endoskeleton includes a **cranium,** or skull, to
enclose and protect the brain. It also generally includes two pairs of
limbs. Limb girdles (such as the human hips and shoulders) connect the
limbs to the rest of the endoskeleton.

</div>

#### Other Vertebrate Traits {#13.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgVmVydGVicmF0ZSBUcmFpdHM._1-xvk}

There are several additional traits found in virtually all vertebrates.

-   Vertebrates have a system of muscles attached to the endoskeleton to
    enable movement. Muscles control movement by alternately
    contracting (shortening) and relaxing (lengthening). Generally,
    muscles work together in opposing pairs.
-   Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system with a heart. Blood is
    completely contained within blood vessels that carry the blood
    throughout the body. The heart is divided into chambers that work
    together to pump blood. There are between two and four chambers in
    the vertebrate heart. With more chambers, there is more oxygen in
    the blood and more vigorous pumping action.
-   Most vertebrates have skin covered with scales, feathers, fur,
    or hair. These features serve a variety of functions, such as
    waterproofing and insulating the body.
-   Vertebrates have an excretory system that includes a pair
    of kidneys. **Kidneys** are organs that filter wastes from blood so
    they can be excreted from the body.
-   Vertebrates have an endocrine system of glands that
    secrete hormones. **Hormones** are chemical messengers that control
    many body functions.
-   Vertebrates have an adaptive immune system. The **immune system** is
    the organ system that defends the body from pathogens and other
    causes of disease. Being adaptive means that the immune system can
    "learn" to recognize specific pathogens. Then it can produce
    tailor-made proteins called **antibodies** to "attack" them. This
    allows the immune system to launch a rapid attack whenever the
    pathogens invade the body again.
-   Vertebrates have a centralized nervous system. As shown in
    **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTAzLWh1bWFuLW5lcnZvdXMtc3lzdGVt) ,
    the nervous system consists of a brain in the head region. It also
    includes a long spinal cord that runs from the brain to the tail end
    of the backbone. Long nerve fibers extend from the spinal cord to
    muscles and organs throughout the body.

-   Vertebrates are a subphylum of chordates that have a vertebral
    column and an endoskeleton made of cartilage or bone.

**Does the embryo develop in the mother or in an egg?**

Is the egg within the mother or not? Vertebrate reproduction occurs by
one of three methods. These bird eggs demonstrate one of three types of
vertebrate reproduction.

### Vertebrate Reproduction {#13.html#x-ck12-VmVydGVicmF0ZSBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._2-f1x}

Vertebrates reproduce sexually, and almost all of them have separate
male and female sexes. Recall that **sexual reproduction** is the
joining of gametes during fertilization, producing genetically variable
offspring. Generally, aquatic species have external fertilization,
whereas terrestrial species have internal fertilization. Can you think
of a reason why aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates differ in this way?

Vertebrates have one of the following three reproductive strategies:
ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary.

-   **Ovipary** refers to the development of an embryo within an egg
    outside the mother’s body. This occurs in most amphibians and
    reptiles and in all birds.
-   **Ovovivipary** refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg
    within the mother’s body until it hatches. The mother provides no
    nourishment to the developing embryo inside the egg. This occurs in
    some species of fish and reptiles.
-   **Vivipary** refers to the development and nourishment of an embryo
    within the mother’s body. Birth may be followed by a period of
    parental care of the offspring. This reproductive strategy occurs in
    almost all mammals.

**What type of fish is a simple perch?**

Does it have a partial of complete vertebral column? What about a jaw?
Do you think the endoskeleton is made of cartilage or bone? Why are
these important evolutionary steps? A bony skeletal could support a
larger body. Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned and
lobe-finned fish, which then evolved into species that could move out of
the water.

### Vertebrate Evolution {#13.html#x-ck12-VmVydGVicmF0ZSBFdm9sdXRpb24._4-dwo}

The earliest vertebrates were jawless fish, similar to living hagfish.
They lived between 500 and 600 million years ago. They had a cranium but
no vertebral column. The **phylogenetic tree** in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTA0LXZlcnRlYnJhdGUtZXZvbHV0aW9u) gives
an overview of vertebrate evolution. As more data become available, new
ideas about vertebrate evolution emerge.

evolved almost 550 million years ago. Which class of vertebrates evolved
last?

</div>

#### Evolution of Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEZpc2g._4-t9h}

Not too long after hagfish first appeared, fish similar to lampreys
evolved a partial vertebral column. The first fish with a complete
vertebral column evolved about 450 million years ago. These fish also
had jaws and may have been similar to living sharks. Up to this point,
all early vertebrates had an endoskeleton made of cartilage rather than
bone. About 400 million years ago, the first bony fish appeared. A bony
skeleton could support a larger body. Early bony fish evolved into
modern ray-finned and lobe-finned fish.

#### Evolution of Other Vertebrate Classes {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE90aGVyIFZlcnRlYnJhdGUgQ2xhc3Nlcw.._4-kt5}

Amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds evolved after fish.

-   The first amphibians evolved from a lobe-finned fish ancestor about
    365 million years ago. They were the first vertebrates to live on
    land, but they had to return to water to reproduce. This meant they
    had to live near bodies of water.
-   The first reptiles evolved from an amphibian ancestor at least 300
    million years ago. They laid **amniotic eggs** and had
    internal fertilization. They were the first vertebrates that no
    longer had to return to water to reproduce. They could live just
    about anywhere.
-   Mammals and birds both evolved from reptile-like ancestors. The
    first mammals appeared about 200 million years ago and the earliest
    birds about 150 million years ago.

#### Evolution of Endothermy {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEVuZG90aGVybXk._4-y89}

Until mammals and birds evolved, all vertebrates were ectothermic.
**Ectothermy** means regulating body temperature from the outside
through behavioral changes. For example, an ectotherm might stay under a
rock in the shade in order to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. Almost all
living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. Their metabolic
rate and level of activity depend mainly on the outside temperature.
They can raise or lower their own temperature only slightly through
behavior alone.

Both mammals and birds evolved endothermy. **Endothermy** means
regulating body temperature from the inside through metabolic or other
physical changes. On a cold day, for example, an endotherm may produce
more heat by raising its metabolic rate. On a hot day, it may give off
more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. Keeping
body temperature stable allows cells to function at peak efficiency at
all times. The metabolic rate and activity level can also remain high
regardless of the outside temperature. On the other hand, maintaining a
stable body temperature requires more energy—and more food.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._4-tx3}

-   The earliest vertebrates resembled hagfish and lived more than 500
    million years ago.
-   As other classes of fish appeared, they evolved traits such as a
    complete vertebral column, jaws, and a bony endoskeleton.
-   Amphibians were the first tetrapod vertebrates as well as the first
    vertebrates to live on land.
-   Reptiles were the first amniotic vertebrates.
-   Mammals and birds, which both descended from reptile-like ancestors,
    evolved endothermy, or the ability to regulate body temperature from
    the inside.

**What are these geometric shapes?**

These are the scales - the skin - of a blue Siamese fighting fish, and
they almost look like a piece of art. They also look like they form a
smooth, streamlined skin. Why is this important to a fish?

### Structure and Function in Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBpbiBGaXNo_5-vgz}

**Fish** are aquatic vertebrates. They make up more than half of all
vertebrate species. They are especially important in the study of
vertebrate evolution because several important vertebrate traits evolved
in fish. Fish show great diversity in body size. They range in length
from about 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) to 16 meters (about 53 feet). Most
are ectothermic and covered with scales. **Scales** protect fish from
predators and parasites and reduce friction with the water. Multiple,
overlapping scales provide a flexible covering that allows fish to move
easily while swimming.

#### Adaptations for Water {#13.html#x-ck12-QWRhcHRhdGlvbnMgZm9yIFdhdGVy_5-c0b}

Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle.
Several are described below and shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTA1LWZpc2gtYm9keS1wbGFu) .

-   Fish have **gills** that allow them to “breathe” oxygen in water.
    Water enters the mouth, passes over the gills, and exits the body
    through a special opening. Gills absorb oxygen from the water as it
    passes over them.
-   Fish have a stream-lined body. They are typically long and narrow,
    which reduces water resistance when they swim.
-   Most fish have several fins for swimming. They use some of their
    fins to propel themselves through the water and others to steer the
    body as they swim.
-   Fish have a system of muscles for movement. Muscle contractions
    ripple through the body in waves from head to tail. The contractions
    whip the tail fin against the water to propel the fish through
    the water.
-   Most fish have a **swim bladder.** This is a balloon-like internal
    organ that contains gas. By changing the amount of gas in the
    bladder, a fish can move up or down through the water column.

</div>

#### Fish Organ Systems {#13.html#x-ck12-RmlzaCBPcmdhbiBTeXN0ZW1z_5-gjh}

Fish have a circulatory system with a two-chambered heart. Their
digestive system is complete and includes several organs and glands.
Jawed fish use their jaws and teeth to grind up food before passing it
to the rest of the digestive tract. This allows them to consume larger
prey.

Fish also have a centralized nervous system with a brain. Fish brains
are small compared with the brains of other vertebrates, but they are
large and complex compared with the brains of invertebrates. Fish also
have highly developed sense organs that allow them to see, hear, feel,
smell, and taste. Sharks and some other fish can even sense the very low
levels of electricity emitted by other animals. This helps them locate
prey.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-a8r}

-   Fish are aquatic, ectothermic vertebrates.
-   Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle.

**How do fish reproduce?**

Wild male and female Sockeye salmon before spawning. Sockeye salmon are
blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean. Just prior
to spawning, both sexes turn red with green heads. Sockeye spawn mostly
in streams having lakes in their watershed. The young fish spend up to
three years in the freshwater lake before migrating to the ocean.
Migratory fish spend from one to four years in salt water, and thus are
four to six years old when they return to spawn. Navigation to the home
river is thought to be done using the characteristic smell of the
stream, and possibly the sun.

### Fish Reproduction and Development {#13.html#x-ck12-RmlzaCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24gYW5kIERldmVsb3BtZW50_6-oft}

Nearly all fish reproduce sexually, and most species have separate
sexes. Those without separate sexes avoid self-fertilization by
producing sperm and eggs at different times. Each fish typically
produces a large number of gametes. In most fish species, fertilization
takes place externally. These fish are **oviparous** . Eggs are laid and
embryos develop outside the mother’s body. In a minority of fish,
including sharks, eggs develop inside the mother’s body but without
nourishment from the mother. These fish are **ovoviviparous** .

#### Spawning {#13.html#x-ck12-U3Bhd25pbmc._6-gmk}

In many species of fish, a large group of adults come together to
release their gametes into the water at the same time. This is called
**spawning.** It increases the chances that fertilization will take
place. It also means that many embryos will form at once, which helps
ensure that at least some of them will be able to escape predators.

With spawning, there is no way for fish parents to know which embryos
are their own. Therefore, fish generally don’t provide any care to their
eggs or offspring. There are some exceptions, however, including the
fish described in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTA2LW1vdXRoLWJyb29kaW5n) , which is
performing **mouth brooding** .

Mouth Brooding. Some species of fish carry their fertilized eggs in
their mouth until they hatch. This is called mouth brooding. If you look
closely, you can see the eggs inside the mouth of the cardinalfish

</div>

#### Fish Larvae {#13.html#x-ck12-RmlzaCBMYXJ2YWU._6-jmh}

Fish eggs hatch into larvae that are different from the adult form of
the species (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTA3LXNhbG1vbi1sYXJ2YQ..) ). A larva
swims attached to a large yolk sac, which provides the larva with food.
The larva eventually goes through **metamorphosis** and changes into the
adult form. However, it still needs to mature before it can reproduce.

**What type of animal is a sea horse? Is it actually a fish?**

It is, and there are about 50 species of seahorses. Although they are
bony fish, they do not have scales, but rather a thin skin stretched
over a series of bony plates arranged in rings throughout their body.
Each species has a distinct number of rings. Seahorses have a coronet on
their head, which is distinct to each individual, much like a human
fingerprint. Seahorses also swim upright, a characteristic not shared by
other fish. Seahorses are poor swimmers, so they are most likely to be
found resting, with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary
object. They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and eyes
that can move independently of each other. Seahorses eat small shrimp,
tiny fish, crustaceans, and plankton.

### Classification of Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgRmlzaA.._7-yyz}

There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed in
five different classes. The classes are commonly referred to as hagfish,
lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, and lobe-finned fish (see
the table in the previous lesson).

#### Hagfish {#13.html#x-ck12-SGFnZmlzaA.._7-osf}

**Hagfish** are very primitive fish. They retain their notochord
throughout life rather than developing a backbone, and they lack scales
and fins. They are classified as vertebrates mainly because they have a
cranium. Hagfish are noted for secreting large amounts of thick, slimy
mucus. The mucus makes them slippery, so they can slip out of the jaws
of predators.

#### Lampreys {#13.html#x-ck12-TGFtcHJleXM._7-pn2}

Like hagfish, **lampreys** also lack scales, but they have fins and a
partial backbone. The most striking feature of lampreys is a large round
sucker, lined with teeth, that surrounds the mouth (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTA4LWxhbXByZXk.) ). Lampreys use their
sucker to feed on the blood of other fish species.

#### Cartilaginous Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2FydGlsYWdpbm91cyBGaXNo_7-mkc}

**Cartilaginous fish** include sharks, rays, and ratfish (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTA5LWNhcnRpbGFnaW5vdXMtZmlzaA..) ). In
addition to an endoskeleton composed of cartilage, these fish have a
complete backbone. They also have a relatively large brain. They can
solve problems and interact with other members of their species. They
are generally predators with keen senses. Cartilaginous fish lack a swim
bladder. Instead, they stay afloat by using a pair of muscular fins to
push down against the water and create lift.

One of the most important traits of cartilaginous fish is their jaws.
Jaws allow them to bite food and break it into smaller pieces. This is a
big adaptive advantage because it greatly expands the range of food
sources they can consume. Jaws also make cartilaginous fish excellent
predators. It you’ve ever seen the film *Jaws,* then you know that jaws
make sharks very fierce predators (see also **Figure**

#### Ray-Finned Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-UmF5LUZpbm5lZCBGaXNo_7-rud}

**Ray-finned fish** include the majority of living fish species,
including goldfish, tuna, salmon, perch, and cod. They have a bony
endoskeleton and a swim bladder. Their thin fins consist of webs of skin
over flexible bony rays, or spines. The fins lack muscle, so their
movements are controlled by muscles in the body wall. You can compare
their ray fins with the fleshy fins of lobe-finned fish in **Figure**

Fins of Bony Fish. The fins of ray-finned and lobe-finned fish are quite
different. How is the form of the fins related to their different
functions in the two classes of fish? Ray Fin (left), Lobe Fin (right)

</div>

#### Lobe-Finned Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-TG9iZS1GaW5uZWQgRmlzaA.._7-fis}

**Lobe-finned fish** are currently far fewer in number than ray-finned
fish. Their fins, like the one shown in **Figure**
[above](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTExLWJvbnktZmlzaC1maW5z) , contain a
stump-like appendage of bone and muscle. There are two groups of
lobe-finned fish still alive today: coelacanths and lungfish.

1.  **Coelacanths** are ancient fish with just two living species. They
    are at risk of extinction because of their very small numbers.
2.  **Lungfish** have a lung-like organ for breathing air. The organ is
    an adaptation of the swim bladder. It allows them to survive for
    long periods out of water.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-lw0}

-   There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed
    in five classes: hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned
    bony fish, and lobe-finned bony fish.

**Are there actually ecosystems in the ocean?**

There are. Different types of fish live in different types of
ecosystems. Shown above are tropical fish in a coral reef ecosystem.
Some fish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers, whereas others live in shallow
waters. Other fish may not be able to survive in the ocean, as they need
freshwater.

### Evolution of Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEZpc2g._8-0yy}

The evolution of fish from hagfish to finned fish is a long and involved
process. One step in this evolution involves the change in function of
gills. Invertebrate chordates use their **gills** to filter food out of
water, not to absorb oxygen. In the early evolution of fish, there was a
switch to using gills to absorb oxygen instead of to filter food. Gills
consist of many thin, folded tissues that provide a large surface area
for oxygen uptake. With more oxygen absorbed by the gills, fish could
become much larger and more active.

#### Timing of Fish Evolution {#13.html#x-ck12-VGltaW5nIG9mIEZpc2ggRXZvbHV0aW9u_8-wg1}

Ancestors of hagfish are thought to have been the earliest vertebrates.
Their fossils date back to about 550 million years ago. Fossils of
**cartilaginous fish** with jaws, resembling living sharks, first
appeared in the fossil record about 450 million years ago. They were
followed about 50 million years later by the bony fish.

#### The Bony Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJvbnkgRmlzaA.._8-iv0}

At first, the **lobe-finned bony fish** were much more common than the
**ray-finned bony fish** that dominate today. Lobe-finned fish were also
ancestral to amphibians. Their stump-like appendages and lung-like
organs evolved into amphibian legs and lungs. Ray-finned bony fish may
have been the first fish to evolve in freshwater. They eventually became
the most diverse and dominant class of fish.

### Ecology of Fish {#13.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBGaXNo_8-lln}

The habitats and diets of fish are varied. They live throughout the
ocean and also in freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. However,
there is one fish, the Mudskipper, that spends time on land. See
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGqae7vuUWo](watch?v=zGqae7vuUWo) for
additional information.

#### Fish Food {#13.html#x-ck12-RmlzaCBGb29k_8-rxf}

Most fish are **predators** , but the nature of their prey and how they
consume it differs from one class to another and even within classes.

-   Hagfish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers. They feed on other fish,
    either living or dead. They enter the body of their prey through the
    mouth or anus. Then they literally eat their prey from the
    inside out.
-   Lampreys generally live in shallow ocean water or freshwater. They
    either consume small invertebrates or suck blood from larger fish
    with their sucker mouth.
-   Cartilaginous fish such as sharks may live on the bottom of
    the ocean. However, most live in the water column. They prey on
    other fish and aquatic mammals or else consume plankton.
-   Bony fish may live in salt water or freshwater. They consume a wide
    range of foods. For example, they may eat algae, smaller fish,
    detritus, or dead organisms, depending on the species of fish.

#### Fish at Risk {#13.html#x-ck12-RmlzaCBhdCBSaXNr_8-bj5}

Today, more than 1,000 species of fish are at risk of extinction. This
is mainly because of human actions. Specific causes include over-fishing
and habitat destruction caused by water pollution, dam building, and the
introduction of non-native species.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._8-mvb}

-   The evolution of fish included a shift from using the gills for
    filtering food to using them to absorb oxygen from water.
-   The earliest fish, resembling living hagfish, evolved about 550
    million years ago.
-   Adaptations that eventually evolved in fish include a complete
    vertebral column, jaws, and an endoskeleton made of bones instead
    of cartilage.
-   Fish live throughout the ocean and in freshwater lakes and streams.
-   Most fish are predators, but the nature of their prey and how they
    consume it may vary.
-   Many species of fish are threatened by human actions, such as water
    pollution and overfishing.

**So how did vertebrates move from the water onto land?**

There had to be some major modifications. Modifications in how the
animal moves, how the animal breathes, and modifications in the animals
skin.

### Structure and Function in Amphibians {#13.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBpbiBBbXBoaWJpYW5z_9-p6z}

**Amphibians** are vertebrates that exist in two worlds: they divide
their time between freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They share a
number of features with air-breathing lungfish, but they also differ
from lungfish in many ways. One way they differ is their appendages.
Modern amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, as shown
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTEyLWxpdmluZy1hbXBoaWJpYW5z)
.

![Examples of living
amphibians](ck12_13_files/20150914105342997893.jpeg "Examples of living amphibians")

**Figure 13.16**

Examples of Living Amphibians. In what ways do these three amphibians
appear to be similar? In what ways do they appear to be different?

</div>

Amphibians are the first true **tetrapods** , or vertebrates with four
limbs. Amphibians have less variation in size than fish, ranging in
length from 1 centimeter (2.5 inches) to 1.5 meters (about 5 feet). They
generally have moist skin without scales. Their skin contains
**keratin** , a tough, fibrous protein found in the skin, scales,
feathers, hair, and nails of tetrapod vertebrates, from amphibians to
humans. Some forms of keratin are tougher than others. The form in
amphibian skin is not very tough, and it allows gases and water to pass
through their skin.

#### Amphibian Ectothermy {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFuIEVjdG90aGVybXk._9-mcy}

Amphibians are **ectothermic** , so their internal body temperature is
generally about the same as the temperature of their environment. When
it’s cold outside, their body temperature drops, and they become very
sluggish. When the outside temperature rises, so does their body
temperature, and they are much more active. What do you think might be
some of the pros and cons of ectothermy in amphibians?

#### Amphibian Organ Systems {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFuIE9yZ2FuIFN5c3RlbXM._9-b5x}

All amphibians have digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. All
three systems share a body cavity called the **cloaca.** Wastes enter
the cloaca from the digestive and excretory systems, and gametes enter
the cloaca from the reproductive system. An opening in the cloaca allows
the wastes and gametes to leave the body.

Amphibians have a relatively complex circulatory system with a
three-chambered heart. Their nervous system is also rather complex,
allowing them to interact with each other and their environment.
Amphibians have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals. Other sense
organs include eyes and ears. Of all amphibians, frogs generally have
the best vision and hearing. Frogs also have a **larynx** , or voice
box, to make sounds.

Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults.
Additional oxygen is absorbed through the skin in most species. The skin
is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands. In some
species, mucous glands also produce toxins, which help protect the
amphibians from predators. The golden frog shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTEzLWdvbGRlbi1mcm9n) is an example of a
toxic amphibian.

**What changes must occur for these tadpoles to move onto land?**

These are tadpoles of the Yellow-Bellied Toad. Of course these tadpoles
are born in the water. You can see the beginning of the formation of the
hind limbs.

### Amphibian Reproduction and Development {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFuIFJlcHJvZHVjdGlvbiBhbmQgRGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ._10-rau}

Amphibians reproduce sexually with either external or internal
fertilization. They attract mates in a variety of ways. For example, the
loud croaking of frogs is their mating call. Each frog species has its
own distinctive call that other members of the species recognize as
their own. Most salamanders use their sense of smell to find a mate. The
males produce a chemical odor that attracts females of the species.

#### Amphibian Eggs {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFuIEVnZ3M._10-ywf}

Unlike other tetrapod vertebrates (reptiles, birds, and mammals),
amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs. Therefore, they must lay their
eggs in water so they won’t dry out. Their eggs are usually covered in a
jelly-like substance, like the frog eggs shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTE0LWZyb2ctZWdncy1jbG9zZXVw) . The
“jelly” helps keep the eggs moist and offers some protection from
predators.

**Figure 13.18**

Frog Eggs. Frog eggs are surrounded by “jelly.” What is its function?

</div>

Amphibians generally lay large number of eggs. Often, many adults lay
eggs in the same place at the same time. This helps to ensure that eggs
will be fertilized and at least some of the embryos will survive. Once
eggs have been laid, most amphibians are done with their parenting.

#### Amphibian Larvae {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFuIExhcnZhZQ.._10-rqt}

The majority of amphibian species go through a larval stage that is very
different from the adult form, as you can see from the frog in
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTE1LWZyb2ctZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ.)
. The early larval, or **tadpole** , stage resembles a fish. It lacks
legs and has a long tail, which it uses to swim. The tadpole also has
gills to absorb oxygen from water. As the larva undergoes
**metamorphosis** , it grows legs, loses its tail, and develops lungs.
These changes prepare it for life on land as an adult frog.

**Frog, toad, or salamander. What's the difference?**

Look closely at the face of this salamander. It is strikingly similar to
that of a frog or toad. As the first vertebrates to evolve from life in
the sea to life on land, amphibians share a number of important
evolutionary adaptations.

### Classification of Amphibians {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQW1waGliaWFucw.._11-91a}

There are about 6,200 known species of living amphibians. They are
placed in three different orders:

1.  Frogs and toads
2.  Salamanders and newts
3.  Caecilians

#### Frogs and Toads {#13.html#x-ck12-RnJvZ3MgYW5kIFRvYWRz_11-a68}

One feature that distinguishes **frogs** and **toads** from other
amphibians is lack of a tail in adulthood. Frogs and toads also have
much longer back legs than other amphibians. Their back legs are
modified for jumping. Frogs can jump up to 20 times their own body
length. That’s the same as you jumping at least 100 feet, or more than
the length of a basketball court. Think how fast you could move if you
could travel that far on one jump!

Frogs and toads are closely related, but they differ in several ways.
Generally, frogs spend more time in water, and toads spend more time on
land. As you can see from **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTE2LWZyb2ctYW5kLXRvYWQ.) , frogs also
have smoother, moister skin than toads, as well as longer hind legs.

[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTE3LXNhbGFtYW5kZXItbmV3dC1jb21wb3NpdGU.)
). They also have a long body with short legs, and all their legs are
about the same length. This is because they are adapted for walking and
swimming rather than jumping. An unusual characteristic of salamanders
is their ability to regenerate, or regrow, legs that have been lost to
predators.

**Why were amphibians so successful?**

They might not have had many predators on land 365 million years ago.
Given plenty of land and food, they had the resources to thrive. This is
a frog fossil from the Eocene epoch. The vertebral column and four limbs
are easily identifiable.

### Evolution of Amphibians {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEFtcGhpYmlhbnM._12-0kw}

Fossil evidence shows that amphibians evolved about 365 million years
ago from a lobe-finned lungfish ancestor. As the earliest land
vertebrates, they were highly successful. Some of them were much larger
than today’s amphibians. For more than 100 million years, amphibians
remained the dominant land vertebrates. Then some of them evolved into
reptiles. Once reptiles appeared, with their amniotic eggs, they
replaced amphibians as the dominant land vertebrates.

### Ecology of Amphibians {#13.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBBbXBoaWJpYW5z_12-inb}

Amphibians can be found in freshwater and moist terrestrial habitats
throughout the world. The only continent without amphibians is
Antarctica. Amphibians are especially numerous in temperate lakes and
ponds and in tropical rainforests.

#### Amphibians as Prey and Predators {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1waGliaWFucyBhcyBQcmV5IGFuZCBQcmVkYXRvcnM._12-vxf}

Amphibians are an important food source for animals such as birds,
snakes, raccoons, and fish. Amphibians are also important predators. As
larvae, they feed mainly on small aquatic animals such as water insects.
They may also feed on algae. As adults, amphibians are completely
**carnivorous** . They may catch and eat worms, snails, and insects, as
the frog in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTE5LWZyb2ctcHJlZGF0b3I.) is doing.
Unlike other amphibians, caecilians are **burrowers** . They use their
head to dig in the soil, and they feed on earthworms and other annelids.
Caecilians can be found in moist soil near rivers and streams in
tropical regions.

#### The Threat of Amphibian Extinction {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFRocmVhdCBvZiBBbXBoaWJpYW4gRXh0aW5jdGlvbg.._12-gs4}

Currently, almost one third of all amphibian species face the threat of
extinction. The reasons include habitat loss, pollution, climate change,
and the introduction of non-native species. Most of these problems are
the result of human actions.

Amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the
environment. This may explain why they seem to be especially sensitive
to pollution. Monitoring the health and survival of amphibians may help
people detect pollution early, before other organisms are affected.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-tug}

-   Amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned
    fish ancestor.
-   As the earliest land vertebrates, amphibians were highly successful
    for more than 100 million years until reptiles took over as the
    dominant land vertebrates.
-   Amphibians are found throughout the world except in Antarctica
    and Greenland.
-   Amphibians are important prey for animals such as birds, snakes,
    and raccoons. They are important predators of insects, worms, and
    other invertebrates.
-   Up to one third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction
    because of human actions, such as habitat destruction, climate
    change, and pollution.

**Why did amphibians evolve into reptiles?**

It probably has to do with food and land. Having to live close to water
limits the resources available to a species. Having the ability to live
away from water allowed reptiles to search for additional food.

### Structure and Function in Reptiles {#13.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBpbiBSZXB0aWxlcw.._13-pwo}

**Reptiles** are a class of tetrapod vertebrates that produce amniotic
eggs. They include crocodiles, alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles.
The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates. It
consists of all amniotes except birds and mammals. Reptiles have several
adaptations for living on dry land that amphibians lack. For example, as
shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTIwLWNyb2NvZGlsZS1zY2FsZXM.) , the skin
of most reptiles is covered with scales. The scales, which are made of
very tough **keratin** , protect reptiles from injury and prevent them
from losing water.

**Figure 13.24**

Crocodile Scales. These crocodiles are covered with tough, waterproof
scales.

</div>

#### Reptile Respiration {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZSBSZXNwaXJhdGlvbg.._13-qdd}

The scales of reptiles prevent them from absorbing oxygen through their
skin, as amphibians can. Instead, reptiles breathe air only through
their lungs. However, their lungs are more efficient than the lungs of
amphibians, with more surface area for gas exchange. This is another
important reptile adaptation for life on land.

Reptiles have various ways of moving air into and out of their lungs.
Lizards and snakes use muscles of the chest wall for this purpose. These
are the same muscles used for running, so lizards have to hold their
breath when they run. Crocodiles and alligators have a large sheet of
muscle below the lungs, called a **diaphragm,** that controls their
breathing. This is a structure that is also found in mammals.

#### Ectothermy in Reptiles {#13.html#x-ck12-RWN0b3RoZXJteSBpbiBSZXB0aWxlcw.._13-uek}

Like amphibians, reptiles are **ectotherms** with a slow metabolic rate.
Their metabolism doesn’t generate enough energy to keep their body
temperature stable. Instead, reptiles regulate their body temperature
through their behavior. For example, the crocodile in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTIxLXJlcHRpbGUtZWN0b3RoZXJteQ..) is
soaking up heat from the environment by basking in the sun. Because of
their ectothermy, reptiles can get by with as little as one tenth the
food needed by endotherms such as mammals. Some species of reptiles can
go several weeks between meals.

**Figure 13.25**

Heat Transfer to an Ectothermic Reptile. This crocodile is being warmed
by the environment in three ways. Heat is radiating directly from the
sun to the animal’s back. Heat is also being conducted to the animal
from the rocks it rests on. In addition, convection currents are
carrying warm air from surrounding rocks to the animal’s body.

</div>

#### Other Reptile Structures {#13.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgUmVwdGlsZSBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVz_13-exs}

Like amphibians, most reptiles have a heart with three chambers,
although crocodiles and alligators have a four-chambered heart like
birds and mammals. The reptile brain is also similar in size to the
amphibian brain, taking into account overall body size. However, the
parts of the reptile brain that control the senses and learned behavior
are larger than in amphibians.

Most reptiles have good eyesight and a keen sense of smell. Snakes smell
scents in the air using their forked tongue (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTIyLXNuYWtlLXNtZWxsaW5n) ). This helps
them locate prey. Some snakes have heat-sensing organs on their head
that help them find endothermic prey, such as small mammals and birds.

**What are the advantages of a water-tight egg?**

Obviously, water-tight eggs can be laid anywhere. They do not have to be
kept constantly moist. There is no danger of the developing fetus
dehydrating. Shown above is a turtle hatching.

### Reptile Reproduction {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZSBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._14-mju}

Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. Males
have one or two penises that pass sperm from their **cloaca** to the
cloaca of a female. Fertilization occurs within the cloaca, and
fertilized eggs leave the female’s body through the opening in the
cloaca. In a minority of species, the eggs are retained inside the
female’s body until they hatch. Then the offspring leave the mother’s
body through the cloaca opening.

#### Amniotic Eggs {#13.html#x-ck12-QW1uaW90aWMgRWdncw.._14-bcu}

Unlike amphibians, reptiles produce **amniotic eggs** (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTIzLWFtbmlvdGljLWVnZw..) ). The shell,
membranes, and other structures of an amniotic egg protect and nourish
the embryo. They keep the embryo moist and safe while it grows and
develops. They also provide it with a rich, fatty food source (the
**yolk** ).

**Figure 13.27**

The amniotic egg is an important adaptation in fully terrestrial
vertebrates. It first evolved in reptiles. The shells of reptile eggs
are either hard or leathery.

</div>

#### Reptile Young {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZSBZb3VuZw.._14-hqd}

Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have a larval stage. Instead, newly
hatched reptiles look like smaller versions of the adults. They are able
to move about on their own, but they are vulnerable to predators. Even
so, most reptile parents provide no care to their hatchlings. In fact,
most reptiles don’t even take care of their eggs. For example, female
sea turtles lay their eggs on a sandy beach and then return to the
ocean. The only exceptions are female crocodiles and alligators. They
may defend their nest from predators and help the hatchlings reach the
water. If the young remain in the area, the mother may continue to
protect them for up to a year.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._14-0ys}

-   Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization.
-   Reptile eggs are amniotic, so they can be laid on land instead of
    in water.
-   Reptiles do not have a larval stage, and their hatchlings are
    relatively mature.
-   Reptile parents provide little if any care to their young.

**With so many possible colors, how would a chameleon be classified?**

Chameleons are a distinctive and highly specialized type of lizard. They
are distinguished partly by their parrot-like feet, their separately
mobile and stereoscopic eyes, their very long, highly modified, and
rapidly extrudable tongues, crests or horns on their distinctively
shaped heads, and the ability of some to change color. But there are
approximately 160 species of chameleons. So how are they classified?

### Classification of Reptiles {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgUmVwdGlsZXM._15-agq}

**So what exactly is a dinosaur?**

Dinosaurs were not lizards. Rather, they were a separate group of
reptiles with a distinct upright posture not found in lizards. Dinosaurs
can be described as large, powerful reptiles. And many were very big.
But dinosaurs were more than that. They were a varied group of animals
with over 1,000 non-avian species.

### Evolution of Reptiles {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFJlcHRpbGVz_16-tgs}

The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. They
resembled small lizards, but they were not yet reptiles. Their amniotic
eggs allowed them to move away from bodies of water and become larger.
They soon became the most important land vertebrates.

#### Synapsids and Sauropsids {#13.html#x-ck12-U3luYXBzaWRzIGFuZCBTYXVyb3BzaWRz_16-v6l}

By about 320 million years ago, early amniotes had diverged into two
groups, called synapsids and sauropsids. **Synapsids** were amniotes
that eventually gave rise to mammals. **Sauropsids** were amniotes that
evolved into reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds. The two groups of amniotes
differed in their skulls. The earliest known reptile, pictured in
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTI0LWh5bG9ub211cw..) , dates
back about 315 million years.

**Figure 13.28**

Earliest Reptile: *Hylonomus* . The earliest known reptile is given the
genus name *Hylonomus* . It was about 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12
inches) long, lived in swamps, and ate insects and other small
invertebrates.

</div>

At first, synapsids were more successful than sauropsids. They became
the most common vertebrates on land. However, during the Permian mass
extinction 245 million years ago, most synapsids went extinct. Their
niches were taken over by sauropsids, which had been relatively
unimportant until then. This is called the **Triassic takeover** .

#### Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs {#13.html#x-ck12-UmlzZSBhbmQgRmFsbCBvZiB0aGUgRGlub3NhdXJz_16-0tu}

By the middle of the Triassic about 225 million years ago, sauropsids
had evolved into **dinosaurs** . Dinosaurs became increasingly important
throughout the rest of the Mesozoic Era, as they radiated to fill most
terrestrial niches. This is why the Mesozoic Era is called the **Age of
the Dinosaurs.** During the next mass extinction, which occurred at the
end of the Mesozoic Era, all of the dinosaurs went extinct. Many other
reptiles survived, however, and they eventually gave rise to modern
reptiles.

#### Evolution of Modern Reptile Orders {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE1vZGVybiBSZXB0aWxlIE9yZGVycw.._16-bbd}

**Figure**

shows a traditional **phylogenetic tree** of living reptiles. Based on
this tree, some of the earliest reptiles to diverge were ancestors of
turtles. The first turtle-like reptiles are thought to have evolved
about 250 million years ago. Ancestral crocodilians evolved at least 220
million years ago. Tuataras may have diverged from squamates (snakes and
lizards) not long after that. Finally, lizards and snakes went their
separate ways about 150 million years ago.

**Where do reptiles live?**

Anywhere and everywhere. Shown here is a sea turtle. Obviously, this
reptile lives in the ocean. But reptiles can also live in the desert,
jungle, forest, or even your backyard. Reptiles live in practically
every type of habitat.

### Ecology of Reptiles {#13.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBSZXB0aWxlcw.._17-fac}

Today, reptiles live in a wide range of habitats. They can be found on
every continent except Antarctica. Many turtles live in the ocean, while
others live in freshwater or on land. Lizards are all **terrestrial** ,
but their habitats may range from deserts to rainforests, and from
underground burrows to the tops of trees. Most snakes are terrestrial
and live in a wide range of habitats, but some snakes are **aquatic** .
Crocodilians live in and around swamps or bodies of freshwater or salt
water.

#### Reptile Diets {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZSBEaWV0cw.._17-sig}

What reptiles eat is also very diverse, but the majority of reptiles are
**carnivores** . Large reptiles such as crocodilians are the top
predators in their ecosystems, preying on birds, fish, deer, turtles,
and sometimes domestic livestock. Their powerful jaws can crush bones
and even turtle shells. Smaller reptiles—including tuataras, snakes, and
many lizards—are also important predators, preying on insects, frogs,
birds, and small mammals such as mice.

Most terrestrial turtles are **herbivores** . They graze on grasses,
leaves, flowers, and fruits. Marine turtles and some species of lizards
are omnivores, feeding on plants as well as insects, worms, amphibians,
and small fish.

#### Reptiles at Risk {#13.html#x-ck12-UmVwdGlsZXMgYXQgUmlzaw.._17-zc0}

Many species of reptiles, especially marine reptiles, are at risk of
extinction. Some are threatened by habitat loss. For example, many
beaches where turtles lay their eggs have been taken over and developed
by people. Other marine reptiles have been over-hunted by humans. Marine
turtles and their eggs are still eaten in some countries despite being
protected species.

Some reptiles are preyed upon by non-native species introduced by
humans. For example, marine iguanas on the Galápagos Islands are
threatened by dogs and cats that people have brought to the islands. The
iguanas are slow and tame and have no adaptations to these new
predators.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._17-qtm}

-   Reptiles can be found on every continent except Antarctica.
-   Reptiles may live in terrestrial, freshwater, or marine habitats.

**Why is flight so important to birds?**

One of the defining traits of many birds is the ability to fly.
Obviously, flight is a major evolutionary advantage. But together with
the ability to fly must come a number of structural modifications. What
do you think these might be?

### Structure and Function in Birds {#13.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIGFuZCBGdW5jdGlvbiBpbiBCaXJkcw.._18-odf}

**Birds** are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal, which
means they walk on two legs. Birds also lay amniotic eggs with hard,
calcium carbonate shells. Although birds are the most recent class of
vertebrates to evolve, they are now the most numerous vertebrates on
Earth. Why have birds been so successful? What traits allowed them to
increase and diversify so rapidly? Birds can vary considerably in size,
as you can see from the world’s smallest and largest birds, pictured in
**Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTI2LWJlZS1odW1taW5nYmlyZC1vc3RyaWNo) .
The tiny bee hummingbird is just 5 centimeters (2 inches) long, whereas
the ostrich towers over people at a height of 2.7 meters (9 feet). All
modern birds have wings, feathers, and beaks. They have a number of
other unique traits as well, most of which are adaptations for flight.
**Flight** is used by birds as a means of locomotion in order to find
food and mates and to avoid predators. Although not all modern birds can
fly, they all evolved from ancestors that could.

#### Wings and Feathers {#13.html#x-ck12-V2luZ3MgYW5kIEZlYXRoZXJz_18-xy8}

**Wings** are an obvious adaptation for flight. They are actually
modified front legs. Birds move their wings using muscles in the chest.
These muscles are quite large, making up as much as 35 percent of a
bird’s body weight.

**Feathers** help birds fly and also provide insulation and serve other
purposes. Birds actually have two basic types of feathers: flight
feathers and down feathers. Both are shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTI3LWJpcmQtZmVhdGhlcnM.) . **Flight
feathers** are long, stiff and waterproof. They provide lift and air
resistance without adding weight. **Down feathers** are short and
fluffy. They trap air next to a bird’s skin for insulation.

#### Organ Systems Adapted for Flight {#13.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW4gU3lzdGVtcyBBZGFwdGVkIGZvciBGbGlnaHQ._18-bjm}

Birds need a light-weight body in order to stay aloft. Even so, flying
is hard work, and flight muscles need a constant supply of oxygen- and
nutrient-rich blood. The organ systems of birds are adapted to meet
these needs.

-   Birds have light-weight bones that are filled with air. They also
    lack a jaw, which in many vertebrates is a dense, heavy bone with
    many teeth. Instead, birds have a light-weight keratin **beak**
    without teeth.
-   Birds have **air sacs** that store inhaled air and push it into the
    lungs like bellows. This keeps the lungs constantly filled with
    oxygenated air. The lungs also contain millions of tiny passages
    that create a very large surface area for gas exchange with the
    blood (see **Figure**
    [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTI4LW9yZ2FuLXN5c3RlbXMtZm9yLWZsaWdodA..) ).
-   Birds have a relatively large, four-chambered heart. The heart beats
    rapidly to keep oxygenated blood flowing to muscles and
    other tissues. Hummingbirds have the fastest heart rate at up to
    1,200 beats per minute. That’s almost 20 times faster than the human
    resting heart rate!
-   Birds have a sac-like structure called a **crop** to store and
    moisten food that is waiting to be digested. They also have an organ
    called a **gizzard** that contains swallowed stones. The stones make
    up for the lack of teeth by grinding food, which can then be
    digested more quickly. Both structures make it easier for the
    digestive system to produce a steady supply of nutrients from food.

#### Nervous System and Sense Organs {#13.html#x-ck12-TmVydm91cyBTeXN0ZW0gYW5kIFNlbnNlIE9yZ2Fucw.._18-qu7}

Birds have a large brain relative to the size of their body. Not
surprisingly, the part of the brain that controls flight is the most
developed part. The large brain size of birds is also reflected by their
high level of intelligence and complex behavior. In fact, birds such as
crows and ravens may be more intelligent than many mammals. They are
smart enough to use objects such as twigs for tools. They also
demonstrate planning and cooperation. Most birds have a poor sense of
smell, but they make up for it with their excellent sense of sight.
Predatory birds have especially good eyesight. Hawks, for example, have
vision that is eight times sharper than human vision.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-kom}

-   Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal and
    have wings and feathers.

**Is this pair of birds actually a “couple”?**

Yes. Birds do actually pair up each mating season, if not for life. And
the male better be prepared to treat his female properly. There is
actually an elaborate process in which the female chooses her mate.

### Bird Reproduction {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlyZCBSZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24._19-oe6}

Reproduction in birds may be quite complicated and lengthy. Birds
reproduce sexually and have separate sexes and internal fertilization,
so males and females must mate for fertilization to occur. Mating is
generally preceded by courtship. In most species, parents also take care
of their eggs and hatchlings.

#### Courtship and Mating {#13.html#x-ck12-Q291cnRzaGlwIGFuZCBNYXRpbmc._19-71g}

**Courtship** is behavior that is intended to attract a mate. It may
involve singing specific courtship songs or putting on some type of
visual display. For example, a bird may spread out and display its tail
feathers or do a ritualized mating “dance.” Typically, males perform the
courtship behavior, and females choose a mate from among competing
males.

During mating, a male bird presses his **cloaca** against his mate’s
cloaca and passes sperm from his cloaca to hers. After fertilization,
eggs pass out of the female’s body, exiting through the opening in the
cloaca.

#### Nesting and Incubation {#13.html#x-ck12-TmVzdGluZyBhbmQgSW5jdWJhdGlvbg.._19-swo}

Eggs are usually laid in a nest. The nest may be little more than a
small depression in the ground, or it may be very elaborate, like the
weaver bird nest in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTI5LWJpcmQtbmVzdHM.) . Eggs that are
laid on the ground may be camouflaged to look like their surroundings
(also shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTI5LWJpcmQtbmVzdHM.) ). Otherwise, eggs
are usually white or pastel colors such as pale blue or pink.

</div>

After birds lay their eggs, they generally keep the eggs warm with their
body heat while the embryos inside continue to develop. This is called
**incubation,** or **brooding** . In most species, parents stay together
for at least the length of the breeding season. In some species, they
stay together for life. By staying together, the males as well as
females can incubate the eggs and later care for the **hatchlings** .
Birds are the only nonhuman vertebrates with this level of male parental
involvement.

</div>

Ground-nesting birds, such as ducks and chickens, have hatchlings that
are able to run around and feed themselves almost as soon as they break
through the eggshell. Being on the ground makes them vulnerable to
predators, so they need to be relatively mature when they hatch in order
to escape. In contrast, birds that nest off the ground—in trees, bushes,
or buildings—have hatchlings that are naked and helpless. The parents
must protect and feed the immature offspring for weeks or even months.
However, this gives the offspring more time to learn from the parents
before they leave the nest and go out on their own.

#### Parental Care {#13.html#x-ck12-UGFyZW50YWwgQ2FyZQ.._19-aky}

In birds, 90% to 95% of species are **monogamous** , meaning the male
and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one
mate dies. Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are
monogamous. Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs. Birds
usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid. In
**polygamous** species, where there is more than one mate, one parent
does all of the incubating. The wild turkey is an example of a
polygamous bird.

The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different
species of birds. At one extreme, in a group of birds called the
magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at
hatching. In this case, the newly-hatched chick digs itself out of the
nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away.
These birds are called **precocial** . Other precocial birds include the
domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese. At the other
extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of
time. For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive
parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then
take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNC0wNi1ncmVhdC1mcmlnYXRlYmlyZA..) ).
These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called
**altricial** .

In most animals, male parental care is rare. But it is very common in
birds. Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and
nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks. Since birds often take
great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called
**brood parasitism.** This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in
another bird’s nest. The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite
bird's eggs.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._19-q5e}

-   Birds reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization.
-   Mating is generally preceded by courtship.
-   Birds' amniotic eggs have hard shells and are laid in a nest. The
    eggs are usually incubated until they hatch.
-   Most species have a relatively long period of parental care.

**Raptor vs. Landfowl. Any obvious differences?**

Of course there are. That is like comparing a turkey to an owl. And
there are also flightless birds, birds that live near water, and
parrots. With almost 10,000 species of birds, there are bound to be
significant differences.

### Classification of Birds {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgQmlyZHM._20-fly}

There are about 10,000 living species of birds. Almost all of them can
fly, but there are several exceptions.

#### Flightless Birds {#13.html#x-ck12-RmxpZ2h0bGVzcyBCaXJkcw.._20-sd6}

Some birds have lost the ability to fly during the course of their
evolution. Several flightless birds are shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTMwLWZsaWdodGxlc3MtYmlyZHM.) . They
include the ostrich, kiwi, rhea, cassowary, and moa. All of these birds
have long legs and are adapted for running. The penguins shown in the
figure are also flightless birds, but they have a very different body
shape. That’s because they are adapted for swimming rather than running.

Birds that are able to fly are divided into 29 orders that differ in
their physical traits and behaviors. **Table**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YmlyZHM.) describes seven of the most
common orders. As shown in the table, the majority of flying birds are
perching birds, like the honeyeater described in the last row of the
table. The order of perching birds has more species than all the other
bird orders combined. In fact, this order of birds is the largest single
order of land vertebrates.

**Did birds really evolve from dinosaurs?**

One is an ostrich, the other is a mononykus dinosaur. The structural
relationship is obvious. Mononykus moved about on two legs, was very
nimble, and could run at high speeds, something that would have been
useful in the open desert plains where they lived. It had a small skull,
and its teeth were small and pointed, suggesting that it ate insects and
small animals, such as lizards and mammals.

### Evolution of Birds {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEJpcmRz_21-ytq}

Birds are thought to have evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs
called **theropods** . The ancestor of birds was probably similar to the
theropod called *Deinonychus,* which is represented by the sketch in
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTMxLWRlaW5vbnljaHVz) .
Fossils of *Deinonychus* were first identified in the 1960s. This was an
extremely important discovery. It finally convinced most scientists that
birds had descended from dinosaurs, which had been debated for almost a
century.

</div>

#### What was *Deinonychus* ? {#13.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCB3YXM._21-df7}

*Deinonychus* is the genus name of an extinct dinosaur that is
considered to be one of the closest non-bird relatives of modern birds.
It lived about 110 million years ago in what is now North America.
*Deinonychus* was a predatory carnivore with many bird-like features.
For example, it had feathers and wings. It also had strong legs with
clawed feet, similar to modern raptors. Its respiratory, circulatory,
and digestive systems were similar to those of birds as well. The
location of fossilized eggs near *Deinonychus* fossils suggests that it
may have brooded its eggs. This would mean that it was **endothermic** .
(Can you explain why?) On the other hand, *Deinonychus* retained a
number of reptile-like traits, such as jaws with teeth, and hands with
claws at the tips of its wings.

#### Evolution of Flight {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEZsaWdodA.._21-kft}

Scientists have long speculated about the evolution of flight in birds.
They wonder how and why birds evolved wings from a pair of front limbs.
Several hypotheses have been suggested. Here are just two:

1.  Wings evolved in a bird ancestor that leapt into the air to avoid
    predators or to capture prey. Therefore, wings are modified arms
    that helped the animal leap higher.
2.  Wings evolved in a bird ancestor that lived in trees. Thus, wings
    are modified arms that helped the animal glide from branch
    to branch.

Scientists still don’t know how or why wings and flight evolved, but
they continue to search for answers. In addition to fossils, they are
studying living vertebrates such as bats that also evolved adaptations
for flight.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._21-s83}

-   Birds are thought to have evolved from theropod dinosaurs around 150
    million years ago.
-   Bird ancestors may have been similar to the extinct theropod
    *Deinonychus* , whose fossils convinced most scientists that birds
    evolved from dinosaurs.

**Where do birds live?**

Practically anywhere they want. From some of the coldest regions on the
planet to the warmest. Look at these penguins and where they live. Would
you want to live there?

### Ecology of Birds {#13.html#x-ck12-RWNvbG9neSBvZiBCaXJkcw.._22-ep6}

Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on all seven
continents, from the Arctic to Antarctica. Because they are endothermic,
birds can live in a wider range of climates than reptiles or amphibians,
although the greatest diversity of birds occurs in tropical regions.
Birds are important members of every ecosystem in which they live,
occupying a wide range of ecological positions.

#### Bird Diets {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlyZCBEaWV0cw.._22-wyr}

Some birds are generalists. A **generalist** is an organism that can eat
many different types of food. Other birds are highly specialized in
their food needs and can eat just one type of food.

**Raptors** such as hawks and owls are carnivores. They hunt and eat
mammals and other birds. Vultures are **scavengers** . They eat the
remains of dead animals, such as roadkill. Aquatic birds generally eat
fish or water plants. Perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or
nectar. Many fruit-eating birds play a key role in seed dispersal, and
some nectar-feeding birds are important **pollinators** .

Bird beaks are generally adapted for the food they eat. For example, the
sharp, hooked beak of a raptor is well suited for killing and tearing
apart prey. The long beak of the hummingbird in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTE5LTMyLWh1bW1pbmdiaXJkLW5lY3Rhcg..)
co-evolved with the tube-shaped flowers from which it sips nectar.

#### Birds at Risk {#13.html#x-ck12-QmlyZHMgYXQgUmlzaw.._22-lze}

Hundreds of species of birds have gone extinct as a result of human
actions. A well-known example is the passenger pigeon. It was once the
most common bird in North America, but overhunting and habitat
destruction led to its extinction in the 1800s. Habitat destruction and
use of the pesticide DDT explain the recent extinction of the dusky
seaside sparrow. This native Florida bird was declared extinct in 1990.

Today, some 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by
human actions. Humans need to take steps to protect this precious and
important natural resource. What can you do to help?

#### The Golden Eagle {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdvbGRlbiBFYWdsZQ.._22-vdw}

Although not as famous as its bald cousin, Golden Eagles are much easier
to find in Northern California - one of the largest breeding populations
for Golden Eagles. The largest of the raptors, Golden Eagles weigh
typically between 8 and 12 pounds, and their wing span is around 6 to 7
feet. These eagles dive towards earth to catch prey, and can reach
speeds of up to 200 mph! Meet one of the largest birds of prey at

**One of these is not a mammal. Which one?**

Mammals are a class of endothermic vertebrates. They have four limbs and
produce amniotic eggs. Examples of mammals include bats, whales, mice,
and humans. Clearly, mammals are a very diverse group. Nonetheless, they
share many traits that set them apart from other vertebrates.

### Characteristics of Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzIG9mIE1hbW1hbHM._23-wfo}

Two characteristics are used to define the **mammal** class. They are
mammary glands and body hair (or fur).

1.  Female mammals have **mammary glands** . The glands produce milk
    after the birth of offspring. Milk is a nutritious fluid. It
    contains disease-fighting molecules as well as all the nutrients a
    baby mammal needs. Producing milk for offspring is called
    **lactation** .
2.  Mammals have hair or fur. It insulates the body to help conserve
    body heat. It can also be used for sensing and communicating. For
    example, cats use their whiskers to sense their surroundings. They
    also raise their fur to look larger and more threatening (see
    **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTAxLWNhdC13YXJuaW5n) ).

**Figure 13.39**

Cat Communicating a Warning. By raising its fur, this cat is “saying”
that it’s big and dangerous. This might discourage a predator from
attacking.

</div>

Most mammals share several other traits. The traits in the following
list are typical of, but not necessarily unique to, mammals.

-   The skin of many mammals is covered with sweat glands. The glands
    produce sweat, the salty fluid that helps cool the body.
-   Mammalian lungs have millions of tiny air sacs called **alveoli** .
    They provide a very large surface area for gas exchange.
-   The heart of a mammal consists of four chambers. This makes it more
    efficient and powerful for delivering oxygenated blood to tissues.
-   The brain of a mammal is relatively large and has a covering called
    the **neocortex** . This structure plays an important role in many
    complex brain functions.
-   The mammalian middle ear has three tiny bones that carry sound
    vibrations from the outer to inner ear. The bones give mammals
    exceptionally good hearing. In other vertebrates, the three bones
    are part of the jaw and not involved in hearing.
-   Mammals have four different types of teeth. The teeth of other
    vertebrates, in contrast, are all alike.

**Does this mammal breathe like all other mammals?**

Essentially, yes it does. A whale is a mammal, so it has a pair of
lungs, not gills like fish. As shown here, whales take oxygen out of the
air, not out of water.

### Eating and Digesting Food {#13.html#x-ck12-RWF0aW5nIGFuZCBEaWdlc3RpbmcgRm9vZA.._24-5lm}

Maintaining a high metabolic rate takes a lot of energy. The energy must
come from food. Therefore, mammals need a nutritious and plentiful diet.
The diets of mammals are diverse. Except for leaf litter and wood,
almost any kind of organic matter may be eaten by mammals.

Some mammals are strictly **herbivores** or strictly **carnivores** .
However, most mammals will eat other foods if necessary. Some mammals
are **omnivores** . They routinely eat a variety of both plant and
animal foods. Most mammals also feed on a variety of other species. The
few exceptions include koalas, which feed only on eucalyptus plants, and
giant pandas, which feed only on bamboo. Types of mammalian diets and
examples of mammals that eat them are given in **Table**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6bWFtbWFsaWFuLWRpZXRz) . How would you
classify your own diet?

<div id="13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6bWFtbWFsaWFuLWRpZXRz">

[![](images/table.png)](table_13-4.html)

**Click on the image above to view the table**

</div>

Different diets require different types of digestive systems. Mammals
that eat a carnivorous diet generally have a relatively simple digestive
system. Their food consists mainly of proteins and fats that are easily
and quickly digested. Herbivorous mammals, on the other hand, tend to
have a more complicated digestive system. Complex plant carbohydrates
such as cellulose are more difficult to digest. Some herbivores have
more than one stomach. The stomachs store and slowly digest plant foods.

Mammalian teeth are also important for digestion. Mammals have four
different types of teeth. The teeth of other vertebrates, in contrast,
are all alike. The four types of teeth are specialized for different
feeding functions, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA0LW1hbW1hbGlhbi10ZWV0aA..) .
Together, the four types of teeth can cut, tear, and grind food. This
makes food easier and quicker to digest.

### Lungs and Heart of Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-THVuZ3MgYW5kIEhlYXJ0IG9mIE1hbW1hbHM._24-ml1}

Keeping the rate of metabolism high takes a constant and plentiful
supply of oxygen. That’s because **cellular respiration** , which
produces energy, requires oxygen. The lungs and heart of mammals are
adapted to meet their oxygen needs.

The lungs of mammals are unique in having **alveoli** . These are tiny,
sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very
small blood vessels (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA1LWFsdmVvbGk.) ). Because there are
millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area
for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for
example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total
surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square
feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball
court!

**Figure 13.42**

Alveoli of Mammalian Lungs. Clusters of alveoli resemble tiny bunches of
grapes. They are surrounded by many blood vessels for gas exchange.

</div>

Mammals breathe with the help of a **diaphragm** . This is the large
muscle that extends across the bottom of the chest below the lungs. When
the diaphragm contracts, it increases the volume of the chest. This
decreases pressure on the lungs and allows air to flow in. When the
diaphragm relaxes, it decreases the volume of the chest. This increases
pressure on the lungs and forces air out.

The four-chambered mammalian heart can pump blood in two different
directions. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick
up oxygen. The left side of the heart pumps blood containing oxygen to
the rest of the body. Because of the dual pumping action of the heart,
all of the blood going to body cells is rich in oxygen.

### The Mammalian Brain {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1hbW1hbGlhbiBCcmFpbg.._24-3pv}

Of all vertebrates, mammals have the biggest and most complex brain for
their body size (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA2LXZlcnRlYnJhdGUtYnJhaW5z) ). The
front part of the brain, called the **cerebrum** , is especially large
in mammals. This part of the brain controls functions such as memory and
learning.

![Vertebrate brain

**Figure 13.43**

Vertebrate Brains. Vertebrate brains come in a range of sizes. Even the
brains of mammals show a lot of variation in size. The area of the
neocortex is greatest in humans.

</div>

The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering
the cerebrum. This layer is called the **neocortex** (the pink region of
the brains in **Figure**
[above](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA2LXZlcnRlYnJhdGUtYnJhaW5z) ). The
neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In
some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other
mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds
increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the
greater the mental abilities of an animal.

#### Intelligence of Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-SW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlIG9mIE1hbW1hbHM._24-uhp}

Mammals are very intelligent. Of all vertebrates, they are the animals
that are most capable of learning. Mammalian offspring are fed and taken
care of by their parents for a relatively long time. This gives them
plenty of time to learn from their parents. By learning, they can
benefit from the experiences of their elders. The ability to learn is
the main reason that the large mammalian brain evolved. It’s also the
primary reason for the success of mammals.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-qsj}

-   Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. They have four
    types of teeth, so they can eat a wide range of foods.
-   Traits of the heart and lungs keep the cells of mammals well
    supplied with oxygen and nutrients.
-   Mammals have a relatively large brain and a high level
    of intelligence.

**Is this bear cold?**

Not really. Like all mammals, polar bears maintain a stable internal
temperature. They do not need to stay warm by lying in the sun. This
allows them to live in cold climates.

### Endothermy in Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-RW5kb3RoZXJteSBpbiBNYW1tYWxz_25-ju5}

Many structures and functions in mammals are related to **endothermy** .
Mammals can generate and conserve heat when it’s cold outside. They can
also lose heat when they become overheated. How do mammals control their
body temperature in these ways?

#### How Mammals Stay Warm {#13.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1hbW1hbHMgU3RheSBXYXJt_25-ecn}

Mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high. The
cells of mammals have many more **mitochondria** than the cells of other
animals. The extra mitochondria generate enough energy to keep the rate
of metabolism high. Mammals can also generate little bursts of heat by
shivering. **Shivering** occurs when many muscles contract a little bit
all at once. Each muscle that contracts produces a small amount of heat.

Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals. A small
body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size.
Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a
greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals
conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air
next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the
skin, so it becomes an even better insulator. Even humans automatically
contract these muscles when they are cold, causing **goosebumps** (see
**Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTAyLWdvb3NlYnVtcHM.) ).
Mammals also have a layer of fat under the skin to help insulate the
body. This fatty layer is not found in other vertebrates.

**Figure 13.44**

Mammals raise their hair with tiny muscles in the skin. Even humans
automatically contract these muscles when they are cold. They cause
“goosebumps,” as shown here.

</div>

#### How Mammals Stay Cool {#13.html#x-ck12-SG93IE1hbW1hbHMgU3RheSBDb29s_25-mfp}

One way mammals lose excess heat is by increasing blood flow to the
skin. This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment.
That’s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on
a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body
heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body.
Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals
with fur, such as dogs, use **panting** instead of sweating to lose body
heat (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTAzLXBhbnRpbmctZG9n) ). Evaporation of
water from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth and throat
uses heat and helps cool the body.

**What allows this cheetah to be so fast?**

Do you think it has something to do with the placement of the limbs?
Well, it does. Look closely at the cheetah's body. Can you describe why
it is so fast?

### Social Living in Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-U29jaWFsIExpdmluZyBpbiBNYW1tYWxz_26-a1k}

Many mammals live in social groups. Social living evolved because it is
adaptive. Consider these two examples:

1.  Herbivores such as zebras and elephants live in **herds** . Adults
    in the herd surround and protect the young, who are most vulnerable
    to predators.
2.  Lions live in social groups called **prides** . Adult females in the
    pride hunt cooperatively, which is more efficient than
    hunting alone. Then they share the food with the rest of the pride.
    For their part, adult males defend the pride’s territory from
    other predators.

### Locomotion in Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-TG9jb21vdGlvbiBpbiBNYW1tYWxz_26-r2t}

Mammals are noted for the many ways they can move about. Generally,
their limbs are very mobile. Often, they can be rotated. Many mammals
are also known for their speed. The fastest land animal is a predatory
mammal. Can you guess what it is? Racing at speeds of up to 112
kilometers (70 miles) per hour, the cheetah wins hands down. In
addition, the limbs of mammals let them hold their body up above the
ground. That’s because the limbs are attached beneath the body, rather
than at the sides as in reptiles (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA3LWxpbWItcG9zaXRpb24.) ).

**Is this kangaroo a placental mammal?**

You know that female kangaroos have a pouch for the final development of
their babies. So, no, kangaroos are not placental mammals. What is a
placental mammal?

### Therian Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlcmlhbiBNYW1tYWxz_27-sln}

Like other female vertebrates, all female mammals have **ovaries** .
These are the organs that produce eggs (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTA5LWZlbWFsZS1yZXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdGhlcmlhbg..)
). **Therian mammals** also have two additional female reproductive
structures that are not found in other vertebrates. They are the uterus
and vagina.

-   The **uterus** (plural, uteri) is a pouch-like, muscular organ. The
    embryo or fetus develops inside the uterus. Muscular contractions of
    the uterus push the offspring out during birth.
-   The **vagina** is a tubular passageway through which the embryo or
    fetus leaves the mother’s body during birth. The vagina is also
    where the male deposits sperm during mating.

**Figure 13.48**

Female Reproductive System of a Therian Mammal (Human). Therian mammals
are **viviparous** , giving birth to an embryo or infant rather than
laying eggs. The female reproductive system of all therian mammals is
similar to that of humans.

</div>

Therian mammals are divided into two groups: placental mammals and
marsupial mammals. Each group has a somewhat different reproductive
strategy.

### Placental Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-UGxhY2VudGFsIE1hbW1hbHM._27-z4o}

**Placental mammals** are therian mammals in which a placenta develops
during pregnancy. The placenta sustains the fetus while it grows inside
the mother’s uterus. Placental mammals give birth to relatively large
and mature infants. Most mammals are placental mammals.

#### The Placenta {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFBsYWNlbnRh_27-z2p}

The **placenta** is a spongy structure. It consists of membranes and
blood vessels from both mother and embryo (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTEwLWh1bWFuLXBsYWNlbnRh) ). The
placenta passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the
mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from
the fetus to the mother. The placenta lets blood from the fetus and
mother exchange substances without actually mixing. Thus, it protects
the fetus from being attacked by the mother’s immune system as a
“foreign parasite.”

#### Pros and Cons of Placental Reproduction {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJvcyBhbmQgQ29ucyBvZiBQbGFjZW50YWwgUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_27-7t8}

The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth in the uterus. As a
result, the fetus can become large and mature before birth. This
increases its chances of surviving.

On the other hand, supporting a growing fetus is very draining and risky
for the mother. The mother has to eat more food to nourish the fetus.
She also becomes heavier and less mobile as the fetus gets larger. As a
result, she may be less able to escape from predators. Because the fetus
is inside her, she can’t abandon it to save her own life if she is
pursued or if food is scarce. Giving birth to a large infant is also
risky. It may even result in the mother’s death.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._27-hv3}

-   Therian mammals are viviparous. They give birth to an embryo or
    infant rather than laying eggs.
-   The female reproductive system of a therian mammal includes a uterus
    and a vagina.
-   There are two groups of therian mammals: placental mammals
    and marsupials.
-   Placental mammals give birth to a relatively large and mature fetus.
    This is possible because they have a placenta to nourish the fetus
    and protect it from the mother’s immune system. This allows for a
    long period of growth and development before birth.
-   Because the offspring of placental mammals is relatively large and
    mature at birth, it has a good chance of surviving. However,
    carrying and giving birth to a large fetus is risky for the mother.
    It also requires her to eat more food.

**Is it really a bear?**

The koala. Or sometimes called the koala bear. The koala is a marsupial
native to Australia. And it is very different then any bear.

### Marsupials {#13.html#x-ck12-TWFyc3VwaWFscw.._28-c4l}

Marsupials have a different way of reproducing that reduces the mother’s
risks. A **marsupial** is a therian mammal in which the embryo is born
at an early, immature stage. The embryo completes its development
outside the mother’s body in a pouch on her belly. Only a minority of
therian mammals are marsupials. They live mainly in Australia. Examples
of marsupials are pictured in **Figure**

#### The Marsupial Embryo {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1hcnN1cGlhbCBFbWJyeW8._28-rzh}

The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a
yolk sac instead of through a placenta. The **yolk sac** stores enough
food for the short period of time the embryo remains in the uterus.
After the embryo is born, it moves into the mother’s pouch, where it
clings to a nipple. It remains inside the pouch for several months while
it continues to grow and develop. Even after the offspring is big enough
to leave the pouch, it may often return to the pouch for warmth and
nourishment. Eventually, the offspring is mature enough to remain
outside the pouch on its own.

#### Pros and Cons of Marsupial Development {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJvcyBhbmQgQ29ucyBvZiBNYXJzdXBpYWwgRGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQ._28-sh8}

In marsupials, the short period of development within the mother’s
uterus reduces the risk of her immune system attacking the embryo. In
addition, the marsupial mother doesn’t have to eat extra food or carry a
large fetus inside her. The risks of giving birth to a large fetus are
also avoided. Another pro is that the mother can expel the embryo from
her pouch if she is pursued by a predator or if food is scarce. On the
other hand, a newborn marsupial is tiny and fragile. Therefore, it may
be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal.

#### The North American Marsupial: The Opossum {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE5vcnRoIEFtZXJpY2FuIE1hcnN1cGlhbDogVGhlIE9wb3NzdW0._28-aw0}

Most people think of opossums as scary creatures. Is this because they
look kind of funny, walk kind of funny, have beady eyes and sharp teeth,
and can emit a very foul odor? Maybe. But what is so different about
opossums is that they are the only marsupial in North America.

These opossums, however, can be beneficial to humans. They use their
sharp teeth to crush bone – which means that they are good getting rid
of unwanted rodents in your neighborhood. They have excellent immune
systems and they emit that terrible odor for protection. Learn more

**Can a mammal lay an egg?**

This is a mammal. But it is unlike placental or marsupial mammals. If a
mammal does not develop within a placenta or a pouch, what type of
development is left? Eggs!

### Monotremes {#13.html#x-ck12-TW9ub3RyZW1lcw.._29-sdh}

Only five living species of mammals are not therian mammals. They are
called monotremes. **Monotremes** are mammals that reproduce by laying
eggs. The only living monotreme species are the platypus and echidnas
(see **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTEzYS1tb25vdHJlbWVz)
and **Figure** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTEzYi1tb25vdHJlbWVz) ).
They are found solely in Australia and New Guinea (an island not far
from Australia).

Like the platypus, the echidna is a monotreme. The only living monotreme

#### Eggs and Lactation in Monotremes {#13.html#x-ck12-RWdncyBhbmQgTGFjdGF0aW9uIGluIE1vbm90cmVtZXM._29-dwd}

Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina. Instead, they have a
**cloaca** with one opening, like the cloacas of reptiles and birds. The
opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs.

Monotreme eggs have a leathery shell, like the eggs of reptiles. The
eggs are retained inside the mother’s body for at least a couple of
weeks. During that time, the mother provides the eggs with nutrients.
Platypus females lay their eggs in a burrow. Echidna females have a
pouch in which they store their eggs. Female monotremes have mammary
glands but lack nipples. Instead, they “sweat” milk from a patch on
their belly.

#### Pros and Cons of Monotreme Reproduction {#13.html#x-ck12-UHJvcyBhbmQgQ29ucyBvZiBNb25vdHJlbWUgUmVwcm9kdWN0aW9u_29-ior}

The mother’s risks are less in monotremes than in therian mammals. The
mother doesn’t need to eat more or put herself at risk by carrying and
delivering a fetus or an embryo. On the other hand, externally laid eggs
are more difficult to protect than an embryo in a pouch or a fetus in a
uterus. Therefore, monotreme offspring may be less likely to survive
than the offspring of therian mammals.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-go5}

-   Monotremes reproduce by laying eggs.
-   Monotremes have a cloaca instead of a uterus and vagina. The eggs
    pass through the opening of the cloaca.
-   Monotreme reproduction is the least risky for the mother. However,
    eggs are harder to protect than is an embryo or a fetus in a pouch
    or uterus. Therefore, monotreme offspring may have a lower chance of
    surviving than the offspring of therian mammals.

**Which mammalian trait evolved first? What was the first mammal like?
When did the earliest mammal live?**

Detailed answers to these questions are still in dispute, though it is
probably safe to say the earliest mammals were not like this giraffe.
Obviously, the giraffe has some specialized traits.

### Mammalian Ancestors {#13.html#x-ck12-TWFtbWFsaWFuIEFuY2VzdG9ycw.._30-blg}

Ancestors of mammals evolved close to 300 million years ago. They were
**amniotes** called **synapsids** . **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTE0LW1hbW1hbC1waHlsb2dlbnk.) shows how
modern mammals evolved from synapsids. The stages of evolution from
synapsids to mammals are described below.

#### Pelycosaurs {#13.html#x-ck12-UGVseWNvc2F1cnM._30-tya}

Synapsids called **pelycosaurs** became the most common land vertebrates
during the first half of the Permian Period. A pelycosaur genus called
*Dimetrodon* is shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTE1LWRpbWV0cm9kb24.) . *Dimetrodon* had
sprawling legs and walked like a lizard. It also had a fairly small
brain. However, it had started to develop some of the traits of mammals.
For example, it had teeth of different types.

**Figure 13.54**

Pelycosaur Synapsid: *Dimetrodon* . *Dimetrodon* was a pelycosaur. It
lived about 275 million years ago.

</div>

#### Therapsids {#13.html#x-ck12-VGhlcmFwc2lkcw.._30-c91}

Some pelycosaurs gave rise to a group of animals called **therapsids** .
The earliest therapsids lived about 260 million years ago. At first, the
therapsids looked a lot like *Dimetrodon* . But after a while, they
could easily be mistaken for mammals. They evolved a number of mammalian
traits, such as legs positioned under the body instead of along the
sides. Therapsids became the most common and diverse land vertebrates
during the second half of the Permian Period.

The Permian Period ended about 250 million years ago with a mass
extinction. Most therapsids went extinct. Their niches were taken over
by **sauropsids** . These were the amniotes that evolved into dinosaurs,
reptiles, and birds. Not all therapsids went extinct, however. The few
that remained no longer had to compete with many other therapsids. Some
of them eventually evolved into mammals.

#### Cynodonts {#13.html#x-ck12-Q3lub2RvbnRz_30-oqd}

The surviving therapsids were small animals. Some of the most successful
were the **cynodonts** (see **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTE2LWN5bm9kb250) ). They flourished
worldwide during the first half of the Triassic Period. Some of them ate
insects and were **nocturnal** , or active at night. Being nocturnal may
have helped save them from extinction. Why? A nocturnal niche was one of
the few niches that dinosaurs did not take over in the Triassic Period.

Cynodonts became more mammal-like as they continued to evolve. Some of
their mammalian traits may have been adaptations to their nocturnal
niche. For example:

-   The ability to regulate body temperature might have been selected
    for because it would allow nocturnal animals to remain active in the
    cool of the night.
-   A good sense of hearing might have been selected for because it
    would be more useful than good vision when hunting in the dark.

**Figure 13.55**

Probable Mammalian Ancestor: Cynodont. Cynodonts were mammal-like
therapsids. They may have been ancestral to mammals. They were about the
size of a rat.

</div>

By the end of the Triassic Period, cynodonts had become even smaller in
size. They also had evolved many mammalian traits. For example, they had

-   Four different types of teeth.
-   A relatively large brain.
-   Three tiny bones in the middle ear.
-   A diaphragm for breathing.
-   **Endothermy** .
-   **Lactation** .
-   Hair.

Cynodonts probably gave rise to mammals about 200 million years ago.
However, they are not considered to be mammals themselves. In fact,
competition with early mammals may have led to their extinction. They
went extinct sometime during the Jurassic or Cretaceous Period.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-xm5}

-   Amniotes called synapsids were the ancestors of mammals.
-   Synapsids named pelycosaurs had some of the traits of mammals by 275
    million years ago.
-   Some synapsids evolved into therapsids, which became widespread
    during the Permian Period.
-   The few therapsids that survived the Triassic takeover were small,
    arboreal insect eaters. They were also nocturnal. Being active at
    night may explain why they survived and evolved still more
    mammalian traits.

**Could you argue that the duckbilled platypus has some characteristics
of other species?**

Like a bird or a fish? You could. This might suggest that an ancestor of
this species may have been one of the early mammals to evolve.

### Evolution of Early Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIEVhcmx5IE1hbW1hbHM._31-qbu}

The earliest mammals evolved from **cynodonts** . But the evolution of
mammals didn’t end there. Mammals continued to evolve. Monotreme mammals
probably split off from other mammals first. They were followed by
marsupials. Placental mammals probably evolved last.

#### Evolution of Monotremes {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE1vbm90cmVtZXM._31-fjb}

The first monotremes may have evolved about 150 million years ago. Early
monotreme fossils have been found in Australia. An example is a genus
called ***Steropodon*** , shown in **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTE3LXN0ZXJvcG9kb24.) . It may have been
the ancestor of the platypus. Early monotremes retained some of the
traits of their therapsid ancestors. For example, they laid eggs and had
a cloaca. These traits are still found in modern monotremes.

Probable Monotreme Ancestor: *Steropodon* . Like the platypus,
*Steropodon* probably had a bill.

</div>

#### Evolution of Marsupials {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE1hcnN1cGlhbHM._31-9jz}

The first marsupials may have evolved about 130 million years ago. One
of the earliest was the extinct genus ***Sinodelphys*** . A fossil of
this mammal is shown in. It is a remarkable fossil find. It represents a
nearly complete animal. Even tufts of hair and imprints of soft tissues
were preserved.

*Sinodelphys* was about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long. Its limb
structure suggests that it was a climbing animal. It could escape from
predators by climbing into trees. It probably lived on a diet of insects
and worms.

#### Evolution of Placental Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIFBsYWNlbnRhbCBNYW1tYWxz_31-bgm}

The earliest placental mammals may have evolved about 110 million years
ago. The ancestor of placental mammals may be the extinct genus
***Eomaia*** . Fossils of *Eomaia* have been found in what is now China.
It was only about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. It was a tree climber
and probably ate insects and worms. *Eomaia* had several traits of
placental mammals. **Figure**
[below](#13.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIwLTE5LWVvbWFpYQ..) shows how *Eomaia* may
have looked.

**Figure 13.57**

Probable Ancestor of Placental Mammals: *Eomaia* . *Eomaia* lived a

</div>

The placental mammal descendants of *Eomaia* were generally more
successful than marsupials and monotremes. On most continents, placental
mammals became the dominant mammals, while marsupials and monotremes
died out. Marsupials remained the most common and diverse mammals in
Australia. The reason for their success there is not yet resolved.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._31-rkn}

-   Monotremes evolved about 150 million years ago. Like modern
    monotremes, they had a cloaca and laid eggs.
-   Marsupials evolved about 130 million years ago. They were very small
    and ate insects and worms.
-   Placental mammals evolved about 110 million years ago. They were
    also small and climbed trees.
-   Placental mammals became the dominant land mammals. Most marsupials
    and monotremes died out, except in Australia.

**Why so many different types of large mammals?**

Elephants, zebras, gazelles, giraffes, rhinoceros, lions, and
hippopotamuses, to name just some of the animals of Africa. Each species
must have its own niche, otherwise they could not coexist. So, there
must be a role for each species within their ecosystem.

### Evolution of Modern Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-RXZvbHV0aW9uIG9mIE1vZGVybiBNYW1tYWxz_32-flp}

The Cretaceous Period ended with another mass extinction. This occurred
about 65 million years ago. All of the dinosaurs went extinct at that
time. Did the extinction of the dinosaurs allow mammals to take over?

#### Traditional View {#13.html#x-ck12-VHJhZGl0aW9uYWwgVmlldw.._32-j7e}

Scientists have long assumed that the extinction of the dinosaurs opened
up many niches for mammals to exploit. Presumably, this led to an
explosion of new species of mammals early in Cenozoic Era. Few mammalian
fossils from the early Cenozoic have been found to support this theory.
Even so, it was still widely accepted until recently.

#### View from the Mammalian Supertree {#13.html#x-ck12-VmlldyBmcm9tIHRoZSBNYW1tYWxpYW4gU3VwZXJ0cmVl_32-lnu}

In 2007, an international team of scientists compared the DNA of almost
all known species of living mammals. They used the data to create a
**supertree** of mammalian evolution. The supertree shows that placental
mammals started to diversify as early as 95 million years ago.

What explains the diversification of mammals long before the dinosaurs
went extinct? What else was happening at that time? One change was a
drop in Earth’s temperature. This may have favored **endothermic**
mammals over **ectothermic** dinosaurs. Flowering plants were also
spreading at that time. They may have provided new and plentiful foods
for small mammals or their insect prey.

The supertree also shows that another major diversification of mammals
occurred about 50 million years ago. Again, worldwide climate change may
have been one reason. This time Earth’s temperature rose. The warmer
temperature led to a greater diversity of plants. This would have meant
more food for mammals or their prey.

**How would you classify this mammal?**

Obviously it is a camel, but is there more to it than that? There are 17
orders of placental mammals. But then these mammals need to be further
classified into families, genera, and finally species.

### Classification of Placental Mammals {#13.html#x-ck12-Q2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24gb2YgUGxhY2VudGFsIE1hbW1hbHM._33-num}

Traditional classifications of mammals are based on similarities in
structure and function. Increasingly, mammals are being classified on
the basis of molecular similarities. DNA analyses has recently shown
that the traditional orders include mammals that may not be closely
related.

#### Traditional Classification {#13.html#x-ck12-VHJhZGl0aW9uYWwgQ2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24._33-gjo}

The most widely accepted traditional classification of mammals divides
living placental mammals into 17 orders. These orders are shown in
**Table** [below](#13.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cGxhY2VudGFsLW1hbW1hbHM.) .
This classification of mammals was widely accepted for more than 50
years. Placental mammals are still commonly placed in these orders.
However, this classification is not very useful for studies of mammalian
evolution. That’s because it groups together some mammals that do not
seem to be closely related by descent from a recent common ancestor.

</div>

#### Phylogenetic Classification {#13.html#x-ck12-UGh5bG9nZW5ldGljIENsYXNzaWZpY2F0aW9u_33-o8l}

The mammalian **supertree** classifies placental mammals
**phylogenetically** . It uses the analysis of DNA sequences to group
together mammals that are evolutionarily closely related, sharing a
recent common ancestor. These groups are not necessarily the same as the
traditional groups based on structure and function.

The supertree classification places placental mammals in four
**superorders** . The four superorders and some of the mammals in them
are:

-   Afrotheria—aardvarks, elephants, manatees.
-   Xenarthra—anteaters, sloths, armadillos.
-   Laurasiatheria—bats, whales, hoofed mammals, carnivores.
-   Supraprimates—primates, rabbits, rodents.

All four superorders appear to have become distinct from one another
between 85 and 105 million years ago. The exact relationships among the
superorders are still not clear. Revisions in this classification of
mammals may occur as new data become available.

### Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-1gi}

-   Mammals used to be classified on the basis of similarities in
    structure and function into 17 different orders.
-   Recently, DNA analyses have shown that the traditional orders
    include mammals that are not closely related.
-   Phylogenetic classification, based on DNA data, groups placental
    mammals in four superorders. The superorders appear to have become
    distinct from each other 85–105 million years ago.

## Summary {#13.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-3kr}

Vertebrates. From fish to mammals. Obviously a tremendous amount of
differences among these groups of species. But also many similarities.
Fish had to evolve first. Then they moved onto land as amphibians, but
they still had to live close to the water. Then they moved farther away
from the water as reptiles. Reptiles could live anywhere, and they did.
Reptiles became very large and dominated life on the planet. Some
reptiles evolved flight and turned into birds. Others stayed small and
became mammals. When all the large reptiles were extinct, what remained?
Smaller animals, including mammals, which then became the dominant form
of life.

**How is the human body similar to a well-tuned machine?**

Many people have compared the human body to a machine. Think about some
common machines, such as drills and washing machines. Each machine
consists of many parts, and each part does a specific job, yet all the
parts work together to perform an overall function. The human body is
like a machine in all these ways. In fact, it may be the most fantastic
machine on Earth.

As a preview of the human machine, the Emmy award-winning video, *Inside
The Living Body,* at this link is highly recommended:

### Levels of Organization {#14.html#x-ck12-TGV2ZWxzIG9mIE9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbg..-xyk}

The human machine is organized at different levels, starting with the
cell and ending with the entire organism (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTAxLUxldmVscy1vZi1Pcmdhbml6YXRpb24.) ).
At each higher level of organization, there is a greater degree of
complexity.

human](ck12_14_files/20150914105628935962.jpeg "Illustrates the different levels of cellular organization within a human")

**Figure 14.1**

The human organism has several levels of organization.

</div>

#### Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbHM.-azx}

The most basic parts of the human machine are cells—an amazing 100
trillion of them by the time the average person reaches adulthood!
**Cells** are the basic units of structure and function in the human
body, as they are in all living things. Each cell carries out basic life
processes that allow the body to survive. Many human cells are
specialized in form and function, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-SHVtYW4tY2VsbC1jb2xsZWN0aW9u) . Each type of
cell in the figure plays a specific role. For example, nerve cells have
long projections that help them carry electrical messages to other
cells. Muscle cells have many mitochondria that provide the energy they
need to move the body.

You can watch a video about some of the specialized cells of the human
body and how they function at this link:

Different types of cells in the human body are specialized for specific
jobs. Do you know the functions of any of the cell types shown here?

</div>

#### Tissues {#14.html#x-ck12-VGlzc3Vlcw..-sus}

After the cell, the tissue is the next level of organization in the
human body. A **tissue** is a group of connected cells that have a
similar function. There are four basic types of human tissues:
epithelial, muscle, nervous, and connective tissues. These four tissue
types, which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTAzLWh1bWFuLXRpc3N1ZXM.) , make up all
the organs of the human body.

body](ck12_14_files/20150914105629489138.png "An illustration of the four tissue types found in the human body")

**Figure 14.3**

The human body consists of these four tissue types.

</div>

-   **Connective tissue** is made up of cells that form the
    body’s structure. Examples include bone and cartilage.
-   **Epithelial tissue** is made up of cells that line inner and outer
    body surfaces, such as the skin and the lining of the
    digestive tract. Epithelial tissue protects the body and its
    internal organs, secretes substances such as hormones, and absorbs
    substances such as nutrients.
-   **Muscle tissue** is made up of cells that have the unique ability
    to contract, or become shorter. Muscles attached to bones enable the
    body to move.
-   **Nervous tissue** is made up of **neurons** , or nerve cells, that
    carry electrical messages. Nervous tissue makes up the brain and the
    nerves that connect the brain to all parts of the body.

#### Organs and Organ Systems {#14.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5zIGFuZCBPcmdhbiBTeXN0ZW1z-jkc}

After tissues, organs are the next level of organization of the human
body. An **organ** is a structure that consists of two or more types of
tissues that work together to do the same job. Examples of human organs
include the brain, heart, lungs, skin, and kidneys. Human organs are
organized into organ systems, many of which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA0LW9yZ2FuLXN5c3RlbXM.) . An **organ
system** is a group of organs that work together to carry out a complex
overall function. Each organ of the system does part of the larger job.

at the links below.

**Figure 14.4**

Many of the organ systems that make up the human body are represented
here. What is the overall function of each organ system?

</div>

Your body’s 12 organ systems are shown below ( **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6TWFqb3ItT3JnYW4tU3lzdGVtcy1vZi10aGUtSHVtYW4tQm9keQ..)
). Your organ systems do not work alone in your body. They must all be
able to work together. For example, one of the most important functions
of organ systems is to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and to
remove toxic waste products such as carbon dioxide. A number of organ
systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, all work
together to do this.

**What happens if stability is disrupted?**

Remove one stone and the whole arch collapses. The same is true for the
human body. All the systems work together to maintain stability or
homeostasis. Disrupt one system, and the whole body may be affected.

### Homeostasis {#14.html#x-ck12-SG9tZW9zdGFzaXM._1-8ux}

All of the organs and organ systems of the human body work together like
a well-oiled machine. This is because they are closely regulated by the
nervous and endocrine systems. The **nervous system** controls virtually
all body activities, and the **endocrine system** secretes **hormones**
that regulate these activities. Functioning together, the organ systems
supply body cells with all the substances they need and eliminate their
wastes. They also keep temperature, pH, and other conditions at just the
right levels to support life processes.

#### Maintaining Homeostasis {#14.html#x-ck12-TWFpbnRhaW5pbmcgSG9tZW9zdGFzaXM._1-w6s}

The process in which organ systems work to maintain a stable internal
environment is called **homeostasis** . Keeping a stable internal
environment requires constant adjustments. Here are just three of the
many ways that human organ systems help the body maintain homeostasis:

-   Respiratory system: A high concentration of carbon dioxide in the
    blood triggers faster breathing. The lungs exhale more frequently,
    which removes carbon dioxide from the body more quickly.
-   Excretory system: A low level of water in the blood triggers
    retention of water by the kidneys. The kidneys produce more
    concentrated urine, so less water is lost from the body.
-   Endocrine system: A high concentration of sugar in the blood
    triggers secretion of insulin by an endocrine gland called
    the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar
    from the blood.

So how does your body maintain homeostasis? The regulation of your
internal environment is done primarily through negative feedback.
**Negative feedback** is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable
close to a set value ( **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-TVNMUy0xNi0wNC1GZWVkYmFjay1sb29w) ).
Essentially, it "shuts off" or "turns on" a system when it varies from a
set value.

For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day,
in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds
by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way.
When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense
the temperature change. The temperature change triggers a command from
the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot,
the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate.
This response helps decrease body temperature.

Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose
levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the
pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the
conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As
blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose
levels are too low, another **hormone** called glucagon is produced,
which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose.

**Figure 14.5**

Feedback Regulation. If a raise in body temperature (stimulus) is
detected (receptor), a signal will cause the brain to maintain
homeostasis (response). Once the body temperature returns to normal,
negative feedback will cause the response to end. This sequence of
stimulus-receptor-signal-response is used throughout the body to
maintain homeostasis.

</div>

##### Positive Feedback {#14.html#x-ck12-UG9zaXRpdmUgRmVlZGJhY2s._1-qcp}

Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback.
**Positive feedback** is when a response to an event increases the
likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is
milk production in nursing mothers. As the baby drinks her mother's
milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more
the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk
to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions
during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the
birth canal, additional contractions occur.

#### Failure of Homeostasis {#14.html#x-ck12-RmFpbHVyZSBvZiBIb21lb3N0YXNpcw.._1-si8}

Many homeostatic mechanisms such as these work continuously to maintain
stable conditions in the human body. Sometimes, however, the mechanisms
fail. When they do, cells may not get everything they need, or toxic
wastes may accumulate in the body. If homeostasis is not restored, the
imbalance may lead to disease or even death.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._1-ybq}

-   All of the organ systems of the body work together to maintain
    homeostasis of the organism.
-   If homeostasis fails, death or disease may result.

**What's the worst thing you can do to hurt your health?**

Besides pathogens, many other dangers in the environment may negatively
affect human health. For example, air pollution can cause lung cancer.
It can also make asthma and other diseases worse. Bioterrorism is
another potential threat in the environment. It may poison large numbers
of people or cause epidemics of deadly diseases. But the worst thing you
can do to yourself is smoke cigarettes.

### Carcinogens and Cancer {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2FyY2lub2dlbnMgYW5kIENhbmNlcg.._2-w8g}

A **carcinogen** is anything that can cause cancer. **Cancer** is a
disease in which cells divide out of control. Most carcinogens cause
cancer by producing mutations in DNA.

#### Types of Carcinogens {#14.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgQ2FyY2lub2dlbnM._2-u1q}

There are several different types of carcinogens. They include
pathogens, radiation, and chemicals. Some carcinogens occur naturally.
Others are produced by human actions.

-   Viruses cause about 15 percent of all human cancers. For example,
    the virus called hepatitis B causes liver cancer.
-   UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. The radioactive
    gas known as radon causes lung cancer.
-   Tobacco smoke contains dozens of carcinogens, including nicotine
    and formaldehyde. Exposure to tobacco smoke is the leading cause of
    lung cancer.
-   Some chemicals that were previously added to foods, such as certain
    dyes, are now known to cause cancer. Cooking foods at very high
    temperatures also causes carcinogens to form (see **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTE3LW1lYXQtb24tZ3JpbGw.) ).

carcinogens to form.

</div>

#### How Cancer Occurs {#14.html#x-ck12-SG93IENhbmNlciBPY2N1cnM._2-vts}

Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the
cell cycle. These include tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.

-   **Tumor-suppressor genes** normally prevent cells with damaged DNA
    from dividing. Mutations in these genes prevent them from
    functioning normally. As a result, cells with damaged DNA are
    allowed to divide.
-   **Proto-oncogenes** normally help control cell division. Mutations
    in these genes turn them into oncogenes. **Oncogenes** promote the
    division of cells with damaged DNA.

Cells that divide uncontrollably may form a **tumor** , or abnormal mass
of cells. Tumors may be benign or malignant. **Benign tumors** remain
localized and generally do not harm health. **Malignant tumors** are
cancerous. There are no limits to their growth, so they can invade and
damage neighboring tissues. Cells from malignant tumors may also break
away from the tumor and enter the bloodstream. They are carried to other
parts of the body, where new tumors may form. The most common and the
most deadly cancers for U.S. adults are listed in **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Y2FuY2Vycw..) .

  **Gender**   **Most Common Types of Cancer after Skin Cancer (% of all cancers)**   **Most Common Causes of Cancer Deaths (% of all cancer deaths)**
  ------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Males        prostate cancer (33%), lung cancer (13%)                               lung cancer (31%), prostate cancer (10%)
  Females      breast cancer (32%), lung cancer (12%)                                 lung cancer (27%), breast cancer (15%)

More cancer deaths in adult males and females are due to lung cancer
than any other type of cancer. Lung cancer is most often caused by
exposure to tobacco smoke. What might explain why lung cancer causes the
most cancer deaths when it isn’t the most common type of cancer?

#### Cancer Treatment and Prevention {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2FuY2VyIFRyZWF0bWVudCBhbmQgUHJldmVudGlvbg.._2-wn9}

Most cancers can be treated, and some can be cured. The general goal of
treatment is to remove the tumor without damaging other cells. A cancer
patient is typically treated in more than one way. Possible treatments
include surgery, drugs ( **chemotherapy** ), and radiation. Early
diagnosis and treatment of cancer lead to the best chance for survival.
That’s why it’s important to know the following warning signs of cancer:

-   change in bowel or bladder habits
-   sore that does not heal
-   unusual bleeding or discharge
-   lump in the breast or elsewhere
-   chronic indigestion or difficulty swallowing
-   obvious changes in a wart or mole
-   persistent coughing or hoarseness

Having one or more warning signs does not mean you have cancer, but you
should see a doctor to be sure. Getting routine tests for particular
cancers can also help detect cancers early, when chances of a cure are
greatest. For example, getting the skin checked regularly by a
dermatologist is important for early detection of skin cancer (see
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLVJldi0yNC0xOC1EZXJtYXRvbG9naXN0)
).

is early detection important?

</div>

You can take steps to reduce your own risk of cancer. For example, you
can avoid exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and UV light.
You can also follow a healthy lifestyle. Being active, eating a low-fat
diet, and maintaining a normal weight can help reduce your risk of
cancer.

**Is some air actually bad for you?**

This question shouldn't even need an answer. Yes, some air can be
harmful.

### Air Pollution and Illness {#14.html#x-ck12-QWlyIFBvbGx1dGlvbiBhbmQgSWxsbmVzcw.._3-c2p}

Almost 5 million people die each year because of **air pollution** . In
fact, polluted air causes more deaths than traffic accidents. Air
pollution harms the respiratory and circulatory systems. Both outdoor
and indoor air can be polluted.

#### Outdoor Air Pollution {#14.html#x-ck12-T3V0ZG9vciBBaXIgUG9sbHV0aW9u_3-uka}

The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** is an assessment of the pollutants in
the outdoor air based on their human health effects. The health risks
associated with different values of AQI are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTE5LWFpcnF1YWxpdHk.) . When AQI is
high, you should limit the time you spend outdoors. Avoiding exposure to
air pollution can help limit its impact on your health. People with
certain health problems, including asthma, are very sensitive to the
effects of air pollution. They need to be especially careful to avoid
it.

**Figure 14.8**

Air quality is especially important for sensitive people. They include
people with asthma, other respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular
diseases.

</div>

AQI generally refers to the levels of ground-level ozone and
particulates. **Ozone** is a gas that forms close to the ground when air
pollutants are heated by sunlight. It is one of the main components of
smog (see **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTIwLXNtb2c.) ).
Smog also contains particulates. **Particulates** are tiny particles of
solids or liquids suspended in the air. They are produced mainly by the
burning of fossil fuels. The particles settle in airways and the lungs,
where they cause damage.

#### Indoor Air Pollution {#14.html#x-ck12-SW5kb29yIEFpciBQb2xsdXRpb24._3-dzx}

Indoor air may be even more polluted than outdoor air. It may contain
harmful substances such as mold, bacteria, and radon. It may also
contain carbon monoxide. **Carbon monoxide** is a gas produced by
furnaces and other devices that burn fuel. If it is inhaled, it replaces
oxygen in the blood and quickly leads to death. Carbon monoxide is
colorless and odorless, but it can be detected with a carbon monoxide
detector like the one in **Figure**

**"The world has definitely changed." This statement is common at times.
What might it refer to?**

Bioterrorism is a threat against civilized people worldwide. To be
prepared, all levels of government have developed and conducted
terrorism drills. These include protecting responders from harmful
biological substances.

### Bioterrorism {#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvdGVycm9yaXNt_4-zhi}

**Bioterrorism** is the intentional release or spread of agents of
disease. The agents may be viruses, bacteria, or toxins produced by
bacteria. The agents may spread through the air, food, or water; or they
may come into direct contact with the skin. Two of the best known
bioterrorism incidents in the U.S. occurred early in this century:

1.  In 2001, letters containing **anthrax** spores were mailed to
    several news offices and two U.S. Senate offices. A total of 22
    people were infected, and 5 of them died of anthrax.
2.  In 2003, a deadly toxin called **ricin** was detected in a letter
    addressed to the White House. The letter was intercepted at a
    mail-handling facility off White House grounds. Fortunately, the
    ricin toxin did not cause any illnesses or deaths.

**The skeletal system consists of all the bones of the body. How
important are your bones?**

Try to imagine what you would look like without them. You would be a
soft, wobbly pile of skin, muscles, and internal organs, so you might
look something like a very large slug. Not that you would be able to see
yourself—folds of skin would droop down over your eyes and block your
vision because of your lack of skull bones. You could push the skin out
of the way, if you could only move your arms, but you need bones for
that as well!

### The Skeleton {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNrZWxldG9u_5-3v6}

The human skeleton is an internal framework that, in adults, consists of
206 **bones** , most of which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA1LXNrZWxldG9u) . Learn more about
bones in the animation “Bones Narrated”:
[http://medtropolis.com/virtual-body/]()

In addition to bones, the skeleton also consists of cartilage and
ligaments:

-   **Cartilage** is a type of dense connective tissue, made of tough
    protein fibers, that provides a smooth surface for the movement of
    bones at joints.
-   A **ligament** is a band of fibrous connective tissue that holds
    bones together and keeps them in place.

**Figure 14.11**

The human skeleton consists of bones, cartilage, and ligaments.

</div>

The skeleton supports the body and gives it shape. It has several other
functions as well, including:

1.  protecting internal organs
2.  providing attachment surfaces for muscles
3.  producing blood cells
4.  storing minerals
5.  maintaining mineral homeostasis.

Maintaining **mineral homeostasis** is a very important function of the
skeleton, because just the right levels of calcium and other minerals
are needed in the blood for normal functioning of the body. When mineral
levels in the blood are too high, bones absorb some of the minerals and
store them as mineral salts, which is why bones are so hard. When blood
levels of minerals are too low, bones release some of the minerals back
into the blood, thus restoring homeostasis.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._5-9kg}

-   The adult human skeleton includes 206 bones and other tissues.
-   The skeleton supports the body, protects internal organs, produces

**Are bones living?**

It's common to think of bones as not living. But bones are very much
living. In fact, you are constantly making new bone tissue. That means
that you are also constantly getting rid of bone. Bone is full of blood
and nerves and all sorts of cells and proteins, making it an extremely
complex living tissue.

### Structure of Bones {#14.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIEJvbmVz_6-cls}

Many people think of bones as being dead, dry, and brittle. These
adjectives correctly describe the bones of a preserved skeleton, but the
bones in a living human being are very much alive. As shown in
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA2LWJvbmUtbWF0cml4) , the
basic structure of bones is **bone matrix** , which makes up the
underlying rigid framework of bones, composed of both compact bone and
spongy bone. The bone matrix consists of tough protein fibers, mainly
**collagen** , that become hard and rigid due to mineralization with
calcium crystals. Bone matrix is crisscrossed by blood vessels and
nerves and also contains specialized bone cells that are actively
involved in metabolic processes.

You can watch an animated video of bone matrix and other structures of
bone at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qTiw8lyYbs](watch?v=4qTiw8lyYbs) .

**Figure 14.12**

Bone matrix provides bones with their basic structure. Notice the spongy
bone in the middle, and the compact bone towards the outer region. The
osteon is the functional unit of compact bone.

</div>

#### Bone Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-Qm9uZSBDZWxscw.._6-kle}

There are three types of specialized cells in human bones: osteoblasts,
osteocytes, and osteoclasts. These cells are responsible for bone growth
and mineral homeostasis.

-   **Osteoblasts** make new bone cells and secrete collagen that
    mineralizes to become bone matrix. They are responsible for bone
    growth and the uptake of minerals from the blood.
-   **Osteocytes** regulate mineral homeostasis. They direct the uptake
    of minerals from the blood and the release of minerals back into the
    blood as needed.
-   **Osteoclasts** dissolve minerals in bone matrix and release them
    back into the blood.

Bones are far from static, or unchanging. Instead, they are dynamic,
living tissues that are constantly being reshaped. Under the direction
of osteocytes, osteoblasts continuously build up bone, while osteoclasts
continuously break it down. You can watch an animated video of these
processes in bone at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yENNqRJ2mu0](watch?v=yENNqRJ2mu0) .

#### Bone Tissues {#14.html#x-ck12-Qm9uZSBUaXNzdWVz_6-aqc}

Bones consist of different types of tissue, including compact bone,
spongy bone, bone marrow, and periosteum. All of these tissue types are
shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA3LWJvbmUtdGlzc3Vlcw..) .

-   **Compact bone** makes up the dense outer layer of bone. Its
    functional unit is the **osteon** . Compact bone is very hard
    and strong.
-   **Spongy bone** is found inside bones and is lighter and less dense
    than compact bone. This is because spongy bone is porous.
-   **Bone marrow** is a soft connective tissue that produces
    blood cells. It is found inside the pores of spongy bone.
-   **Periosteum** is a tough, fibrous membrane that covers and protects
    the outer surfaces of bone.

**How do bones grow?**

Bones are hard structures. So how do they grow? Well, bones are a living
tissue. They have a blood supply. You are consistently making new bone.
In fact, the human skeleton is replaced every 7-10 years. But how do
bones grow? From their ends, where they have cartilage.

### Growth and Development of Bones {#14.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBEZXZlbG9wbWVudCBvZiBCb25lcw.._7-lin}

Early in the development of a human fetus, the skeleton is made entirely
of **cartilage** . The relatively soft cartilage gradually turns into
hard bone through **ossification** . This is a process in which mineral
deposits replace cartilage. As shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA4LUJvbmUtZ3Jvd3Ro) , ossification of
long bones, which are found in the arms and legs, begins at the center
of the bones and continues toward the ends. By birth, several areas of
cartilage remain in the skeleton, including **growth plates** at the
ends of the long bones. This cartilage grows as the long bones grow, so
the bones can keep increasing in length during childhood.

<div
id="14.html#x-ck12-NTlkYzAwNDAwNTI5MDdlNDZlODRjODUwOTJjNmE4M2E.-p2b"
class="x-ck12-img-postcard x-ck12-nofloat">

<!-- @@author="LadyofHats" -->
![](ck12_14_files/20150914105633971284.png)

**Figure 14.14**

Long bones ossify and get longer as they grow and develop. These bones
grow from their ends, known as the epiphysis, and the presence of a
growth plate, or epiphyseal line, signifies that the bone is still
growing.

</div>

In the late teens or early twenties, a person reaches skeletal maturity.
By then, all of the cartilage has been replaced by bone, so no further
growth in bone length is possible. However, bones can still increase in
thickness. This may occur in response to increased muscle activity, such
as weight training.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._7-yvi}

-   Bones become increasingly ossified and grow larger during fetal
    development, childhood, and adolescence.
-   When skeletal maturity is reached at about age 20, no additional
    growth in bone length can occur.

**What allows running?**

Running. A means of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other
animals to move rapidly on foot. The knees, which connect one part of
the leg to the other, have to allow the legs to move. The knee is a
joint, the part of the skeletal system that connects bones.

### Joints {#14.html#x-ck12-Sm9pbnRz_8-rrk}

A **joint** is a place where two or more bones of the skeleton meet.
With the help of muscles, joints work like mechanical levers, allowing
the body to move with relatively little force. The surfaces of bones at
joints are covered with a smooth layer of **cartilage** that reduces
friction at the points of contact between the bones.

#### Types of Joints {#14.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgSm9pbnRz_8-5ex}

There are three main types of joints: immovable, partly movable, and
movable.

For a video about these types of joints, go to the link below.

-   **Immovable joints** allow no movement because the bones at these
    joints are held securely together by dense **collagen** . The bones
    of the skull are connected by immovable joints.
-   **Partly movable joints** allow only very limited movement. Bones at
    these joints are held in place by cartilage. The ribs and sternum
    are connected by partly movable joints.
-   **Movable joints** allow the most movement. Bones at these joints
    are connected by **ligaments** . Movable joints are the most common
    type of joints in the body, so they are described in more
    detail next.

#### Movable Joints {#14.html#x-ck12-TW92YWJsZSBKb2ludHM._8-gln}

Movable joints are also known as **synovial joints** . This is because
the space between the bones is filled with a thick fluid, called
**synovial fluid** , that cushions the joint (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTA5LVN5bm92aWFsLWpvaW50) ).

There are a variety of types of movable joints, which are illustrated in
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTEwLU1vdmFibGUtam9pbnRz) .
The joints are classified by how they move. For example, a
**ball-and-socket joint** , such as the shoulder, has the greatest range
of motion, allowing movement in several directions. Other movable
joints, including **hinge joints** such as the knee, allow less
movement.

**Do you think this would hurt? Why?**

That would probably hurt. And hurt a lot. Broken bones, or fractures,
may be one of the more common problems of the skeletal system. And this
one would probably need surgery to fix. But, in addition to broken
bones, there are other problems and diseases of the skeletal system.

### Skeletal System Problems {#14.html#x-ck12-U2tlbGV0YWwgU3lzdGVtIFByb2JsZW1z_9-ybh}

Despite their hardness and strength, bones can suffer from injury and
disease. Bone problems include fractures, osteoarthritis, and rickets.

-   **Fractures** are breaks in bone, usually caused by excessive stress
    on bone. Fractures heal when osteoblasts form new bone. The
    animation at this link shows how this happens:
    [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVougiCEgH8](watch?v=qVougiCEgH8) .
    Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break. The area
    becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days, bone cells travel to
    the break site and begin to rebuild the bone. It takes about two to
    three months before compact and spongy bone form at the break site.
    Sometimes the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone. In
    such a case, a surgeon will piece a broken bone together with
    metal pins. Moving the broken pieces together will help keep the
    bone from moving and give the body a chance to repair the break.

<!-- -->

-   **Osteoarthritis** is a condition in which cartilage breaks down in
    joints due to wear and tear, causing joint stiffness and pain. For a
    brief animation about osteoarthritis, go to this link:

-   **Osteoporosis** is a disease in which bones lose mass and become
    more fragile than they should be. Osteoporosis also makes bones more
    likely to break. Two of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis are
    eating a healthy diet that has the right amount of calcium and
    vitamin D and to do some sort of weight-bearing exercise every day.
    Foods that are a good source of calcium include milk, yogurt,
    and cheese. Non-dairy sources of calcium include Chinese cabbage,
    kale, and broccoli. Many fruit juices, fruit drinks, tofu, and
    cereals have calcium added to them. It is recommended that teenagers
    get 1300 mg of calcium every day. For example, one cup (8 fl. oz.)
    of milk provides about 300 mg of calcium, or about 30% of the
    daily requirement.

<!-- -->

-   **Rickets** is softening of the bones in children that occurs
    because bones do not have enough calcium. Rickets can lead to
    fractures and bowing of the leg bones, which is illustrated in the
    **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTExLVgtcmF5) .

**What exactly are muscles?**

Does the word "muscle" make you think of the biceps of a weightlifter,
like the man in pictured above? Muscles such as biceps that move the
body are easy to feel and see, but they aren’t the only muscles in the
human body. Many muscles are deep within the body. They form the walls
of internal organs such as the heart and stomach. You can flex your
biceps like a body builder, but you cannot control the muscles inside
you. It’s a good thing that they work on their own without any conscious
effort on your part, because movement of these muscles is essential for
survival.

### What Are Muscles? {#14.html#x-ck12-V2hhdCBBcmUgTXVzY2xlcz8._10-8hy}

The **muscular system** consists of all the muscles of the body. Muscles
are organs composed mainly of muscle cells, which are also called
**muscle fibers** . Each muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell that can
do something no other cell can do. It can contract, or shorten. Muscle
contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the
body, both inside and out. There are three types of muscle tissues in
the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. They are
shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTEzLW11c2NsZS10aXNzdWVz) and described
below.

You can also watch an overview of the three types at this link:

**Figure 14.18**

Types of Muscle Tissue. Both skeletal and cardiac muscles appear
striated, or striped, because their cells are arranged in bundles.
Smooth muscles are not striated because their cells are arranged in
sheets instead of bundles.

</div>

#### Smooth Muscle {#14.html#x-ck12-U21vb3RoIE11c2NsZQ.._10-kaj}

Muscle tissue in the walls of internal organs such as the stomach and
intestines is **smooth muscle** . When smooth muscle contracts, it helps
the organs carry out their functions. For example, when smooth muscle in
the stomach contracts, it squeezes the food inside the stomach, which
helps break the food into smaller pieces. Contractions of smooth muscle
are involuntary. This means they are not under conscious control.

#### Skeletal Muscle {#14.html#x-ck12-U2tlbGV0YWwgTXVzY2xl_10-oaf}

Muscle tissue that is attached to bone is **skeletal muscle** . Whether
you are blinking your eyes or running a marathon, you are using skeletal
muscle. Contractions of skeletal muscle are voluntary, or under
conscious control. When skeletal muscle contracts, bones move. Skeletal
muscle is the most common type of muscle in the human body.

#### Cardiac Muscle {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2FyZGlhYyBNdXNjbGU._10-myy}

**Cardiac muscle** is found only in the walls of the heart. When cardiac
muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. Cardiac muscle
contains a great many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy. This
helps the heart resist fatigue. Contractions of cardiac muscle are
involuntary, like those of smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle, like skeletal
muscle, is arranged in bundles, so it appears **striated** , or striped.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._10-i1n}

-   There are three types of human muscle tissue: smooth muscle (in
    internal organs), skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle (only in

**How do your bones move?**

By the contraction and extension of your skeletal muscles. Notice how
the muscles are attached to the bones. The muscles pull on the bones,
causing movement.

### Skeletal Muscles {#14.html#x-ck12-U2tlbGV0YWwgTXVzY2xlcw.._11-aq4}

There are well over 600 skeletal muscles in the human body, some of
which are identified in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE0LXNrZWxldGFsLW11c2NsZXM.) . Skeletal
muscles vary considerably in size, from tiny muscles inside the middle
ear to very large muscles in the upper leg.

</div>

#### Structure of Skeletal Muscles {#14.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIFNrZWxldGFsIE11c2NsZXM._11-1w7}

Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds or even thousands of skeletal
**muscle fibers** . The fibers are bundled together and wrapped in
connective tissue, as shown **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE1LW11c2NsZS1zdHJ1Y3R1cmU.) . The
connective tissue supports and protects the delicate muscle cells and
allows them to withstand the forces of contraction. It also provides
pathways for nerves and blood vessels to reach the muscles. Skeletal
muscles work hard to move body parts. They need a rich blood supply to
provide them with nutrients and oxygen and to carry away their wastes.

You can watch a video about skeletal muscle structure and how skeletal
muscles work at the link below.

#### Skeletal Muscles and Bones {#14.html#x-ck12-U2tlbGV0YWwgTXVzY2xlcyBhbmQgQm9uZXM._11-bdn}

Skeletal muscles are attached to the skeleton by tough connective
tissues called **tendons** (see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE1LW11c2NsZS1zdHJ1Y3R1cmU.) ). Many
skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones that meet at a
**joint** . The muscles span the joint and connect the bones. When the
muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move.

You can watch a video showing how muscles and bones move together at
this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rzi7zYlWno](watch?v=7Rzi7zYlWno) .

Muscles can only contract. They cannot actively extend, or lengthen.
Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must
work in opposition. For example, the biceps and triceps muscles of the
upper arm work in opposition to bend and extend the arm at the elbow
(see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE2LWJpY2Vwcy10cmljZXBz) ).

You can watch an animation of these two muscles working in opposition at
the link below. What other body movements do you think require opposing
muscle pairs?

#### Use It or Lose It {#14.html#x-ck12-VXNlIEl0IG9yIExvc2UgSXQ._11-8i1}

In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a
resisting force (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE3LWV4ZXJjaXNl) ). Using skeletal
muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as
running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more
blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and
efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger
muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so
use it or lose it.

**What makes a muscle contract?**

It starts with a signal from the nervous system. So it starts with a
signal from your brain. The signal goes through your nervous system to
your muscle. Your muscle contracts, and your bones move. And all this
happens incredibly fast.

### Muscle Contraction {#14.html#x-ck12-TXVzY2xlIENvbnRyYWN0aW9u_12-iu9}

Muscle contraction occurs when muscle fibers get shorter. Literally, the
muscle fibers get smaller in size. To understand how this happens, you
need to know more about the structure of muscle fibers.

#### Structure of Muscle Fibers {#14.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlIG9mIE11c2NsZSBGaWJlcnM._12-rbb}

Each muscle fiber contains hundreds of organelles called **myofibrils**
. Each myofibril is made up of two types of protein filaments: **actin**
filaments, which are thinner, and **myosin** filaments, which are
thicker. Actin filaments are anchored to structures called **Z lines**
(see **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE4LVNhcmNvbWVyZQ..) ).
The region between two Z lines is called a **sarcomere** . Within a
sarcomere, myosin filaments overlap the actin filaments. The myosin
filaments have tiny structures called **cross bridges** that can attach
to actin filaments.

**Figure 14.23**

Sarcomere. A sarcomere contains actin and myosin filaments between two Z
lines.

</div>

#### Sliding Filament Theory {#14.html#x-ck12-U2xpZGluZyBGaWxhbWVudCBUaGVvcnk._12-5sq}

The most widely accepted theory explaining how muscle fibers contract is
called the **sliding filament theory** . According to this theory,
myosin filaments use energy from ATP to “walk” along the actin filaments
with their cross bridges. This pulls the actin filaments closer
together. The movement of the actin filaments also pulls the Z lines
closer together, thus shortening the sarcomere.

You can watch this occurring in a video animation at the link below.
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V-zFVnFkWg](watch?v=7V-zFVnFkWg)

[![](ck12_14_files/tmp84puFd.jpeg)](7V-zFVnFkWg)

Click on the image above for more content

When all of the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber
contracts. A muscle fiber either contracts fully or it doesn’t contract
at all. The number of fibers that contract determines the strength of
the muscular force. When more fibers contract at the same time, the
force is greater.

Actin, myosin and muscle contraction are discussed at

#### Muscles and Nerves {#14.html#x-ck12-TXVzY2xlcyBhbmQgTmVydmVz_12-1gj}

Muscles cannot contract on their own. They need a stimulus from a nerve
cell to “tell” them to contract. Let’s say you decide to raise your hand
in class. Your brain sends electrical messages to nerve cells, called
**motor neurons** , in your arm and shoulder. The motor neurons, in
turn, stimulate muscle fibers in your arm and shoulder to contract,
causing your arm to rise. Involuntary contractions of cardiac and smooth
muscles are also controlled by nerves.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._12-zhr}

-   According to the sliding filament theory, a muscle fiber contracts
    when myosin filaments pull actin filaments closer together and thus
    shorten sarcomeres within a fiber.
-   When all the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the
    fiber contracts.

**What is integumentary?**

Because the organs of the integumentary system are external to the body,
you may think of them as little more than “accessories,” like clothing
or jewelry. But the organs of the integumentary system serve important
biological functions. They provide a protective covering for the body
and help the body maintain homeostasis.

For an overview of the integumentary system, you can watch the animation
at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAAt\_MfIJ-Y](watch?v=IAAt_MfIJ-Y)

### The Skin {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNraW4._13-dxc}

The skin is the major organ of the **integumentary system** , which also
includes the nails and hair. In fact, the skin is the body’s largest
organ, and a remarkable one at that. Consider these skin facts. The
average square inch (6.5 cm ^2^ ) of skin has 20 blood vessels, 650
sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings. It also has an
incredible 60,000 pigment-producing cells. All of these structures are
packed into a stack of cells that is just 2 mm thick, or about as thick
as the cover of a book.

You can watch an excellent video introduction to the skin and its
marvels at the following link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH\_uzjY2bEE&feature=fvw](watch?v=uH_uzjY2bEE&feature=fvw)
.

Although the skin is thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called
the epidermis and the dermis. These layers are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTE5LUxheWVycy1vZi1odW1hbi1za2lu) .

**Figure 14.24**

Layers of Human Skin. The outer layer of the skin is the epidermis, and
the inner layer is the dermis. Most skin structures originate in the
dermis.

</div>

#### Epidermis {#14.html#x-ck12-RXBpZGVybWlz_13-iu6}

The **epidermis** is the outer layer of skin, consisting of epithelial
cells and little else (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTIwLUxheWVycy1vZi1lcGlkZXJtaXM.) ). For
example, there are no nerve endings or blood vessels in the epidermis.
The innermost cells of the epidermis are continuously dividing through
mitosis to form new cells. The newly formed cells move up through the
epidermis toward the skin surface, while producing a tough, fibrous
protein called **keratin** . The cells become filled with keratin and
die by the time they reach the surface, where they form a protective,
waterproof layer called the **stratum corneum** . The dead cells are
gradually shed from the surface of the skin and replaced by other cells.

**Figure 14.25**

Cell Layers of the Epidermis. The epidermis consists mainly of
epithelial cells.

</div>

The epidermis also contains **melanocytes** , which are cells that
produce melanin. **Melanin** is the brownish pigment that gives skin
much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes,
but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The
amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV
light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also
stimulates the skin to produce **vitamin D** . Because melanin blocks UV
light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at
greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

#### Dermis {#14.html#x-ck12-RGVybWlz_13-eud}

The **dermis** is the lower layer of the skin, located directly beneath
the epidermis (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTIxLWRlcm1pcy1zdHJ1Y3R1cmVz) ). It is
made of tough connective tissue and attached to the epidermis by
collagen fibers. The dermis contains blood vessels and nerve endings.
Because of the nerve endings, skin can feel touch, pressure, heat, cold,
and pain. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of
glands.

-   **Hair follicles** are the structures where hairs originate. Hairs
    grow out of follicles, pass through the epidermis, and exit at the
    surface of the skin.
-   **Sebaceous glands** produce an oily substance called **sebum** .
    Sebum is secreted into hair follicles and makes its way to the
    skin surface. It waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent
    them from drying out. Sebum also has antibacterial properties, so it
    inhibits the growth of microorganisms on the skin.
-   **Sweat glands** produce the salty fluid called sweat, which
    contains excess water, salts, and other waste products. The glands
    have ducts that pass through the epidermis and open to the surface
    through pores in the skin.

#### Functions of the Skin {#14.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIHRoZSBTa2lu_13-0lr}

The skin has multiple roles in the body. Many of these roles are related
to homeostasis. The skin’s main functions are preventing water loss from
the body and serving as a barrier to the entry of microorganisms. In
addition, melanin in the skin blocks UV light and protects deeper layers
from its damaging effects.

The skin also helps regulate body temperature. When the body is too
warm, sweat is released by the sweat glands and spreads over the skin
surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the body. Blood vessels in
the skin also dilate, or widen, when the body is too warm. This allows
more blood to flow through the skin, bringing body heat to the surface,
where it radiates into the environment. When the body is too cool, sweat
glands stop producing sweat, and blood vessels in the skin constrict, or
narrow, thus conserving body heat.

#### Skin Problems {#14.html#x-ck12-U2tpbiBQcm9ibGVtcw.._13-sg6}

In part because it is exposed to the environment, the skin is prone to
injury and other problems. Two common problems of the skin are acne and
skin cancer (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTIyLVNpZ25zLW9mLXNraW4tY2FuY2Vy) ).

-   **Acne** is a condition in which red bumps called pimples form on
    the skin due to a bacterial infection. It affects more than 85
    percent of teens and may continue into adulthood. The underlying
    cause of acne is excessive secretion of sebum, which plugs hair
    follicles and makes them good breeding grounds for bacteria.

At the following link, you can watch an animation showing how acne
develops:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11I7ONVqcc0](watch?v=11I7ONVqcc0) .

[![](ck12_14_files/tmpPicGN7.jpeg)](11I7ONVqcc0)

Click on the image above for more content

-   **Skin cancer** is a disease in which skin cells grow out
    of control. It is caused mainly by excessive exposure to UV light.
    People with lighter skin are at greater risk of developing skin
    cancer because they have less melanin to block harmful UV radiation.
    The best way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid UV exposure by using
    sunscreen and wearing protective clothing.

    mainly epithelial cells, and the dermis, which contains most of
    skin’s other structures, including blood vessels, nerve endings,
    hair follicles, and glands.

**Would you believe this is a close-up of your hair and scalp?**

Well maybe not yours. But some other person's. Hair is an integral part
of the integumentary system. And although many people may lose some or
all of the hair on top of their head, they still have hair on their arms
and legs that perform important functions.

### Nails and Hair {#14.html#x-ck12-TmFpbHMgYW5kIEhhaXI._14-fr5}

In addition to the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and
hair. Like the skin, these organs help the body maintain homeostasis.

#### Nails {#14.html#x-ck12-TmFpbHM._14-4jl}

Fingernails and toenails consist of specialized epidermal cells that are
filled with **keratin** . The keratin makes them tough and hard, which
is important for the functions they serve. Fingernails prevent injury by
forming protective plates over the ends of the fingers. They also
enhance sensation by acting as a counterforce to the sensitive
fingertips when objects are handled. Nails are similar to claws in other
animals. They cover the tips of fingers and toes. Fingernails and
toenails both grow from nail beds. As the nail grows, more cells are
added at the nail bed. Older cells get pushed away from the nail bed and
the nail grows longer. There are no nerve endings in the nail. Otherwise
cutting your nails would hurt a lot!

#### Hair {#14.html#x-ck12-SGFpcg.._14-rkx}

Hair is a fiber that is found only in mammals. Its main component is
keratin. A hair shaft consists of dead, keratin-filled cells that
overlap each other like the shingles on a roof (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIxLTIzLWh1bWFuLWhhaXI.) ). Like roof
shingles, the overlapping cells help shed water from the hair.

Hair helps to insulate and protect the body. Head hair is especially
important in preventing heat loss from the body. Eyelashes and eyebrows
protect the eyes from water, dirt, and other irritants. Hairs in the
nose trap dust particles and microorganisms in the air and prevent them
from reaching the lungs. Hair also provides sensory input when objects
brush against it or it sways in moving air.

**A close-up view of a spider web? Some sort of exotic bacteria? What do
you think this is?**

This is actually a nerve cell, the cell of the nervous system. This cell
sends electrical “sparks” that transmit signals throughout your body.

### The Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE5lcnZvdXMgU3lzdGVt_15-2tl}

A small child darts in front of your bike as you race down the street.
You see the child and immediately react. You put on the brakes, steer
away from the child, and yell out a warning, all in just a split second.
How do you respond so quickly? Such rapid responses are controlled by
your nervous system. The **nervous system** is a complex network of
nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body. It
includes the brain and spinal cord, the **central nervous system** , and
nerves that run throughout the body, the **peripheral nervous system**
(see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTAxLVRoZS1OZXJ2b3VzLVN5c3RlbQ..) ). To
understand how nervous messages can travel so quickly, you need to know
more about nerve cells.

nervous system) and nerves that run throughout the body (peripheral

</div>

### Nerve Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-TmVydmUgQ2VsbHM._15-j6q}

Although the nervous system is very complex, nervous tissue consists of
just two basic types of nerve cells: neurons and glial cells.
**Neurons** are the structural and functional units of the nervous
system. They transmit electrical signals, called **nerve impulses.**
**Glial cells** provide support for neurons. For example, they provide
neurons with nutrients and other materials.

#### Neuron Structure {#14.html#x-ck12-TmV1cm9uIFN0cnVjdHVyZQ.._15-dce}

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTAyLW5ldXJvbi1zdHJ1Y3R1cmU.) , a neuron
consists of three basic parts: the cell body, dendrites, and axon. You
can watch an animation of the parts of a neuron at this link:
[http://www.garyfisk.com/anim/neuronparts.swf](neuronparts.swf) .

-   The **cell body** contains the nucleus and other cell organelles.
-   **Dendrites** extend from the cell body and receive nerve impulses
    from other neurons.
-   The **axon** is a long extension of the cell body that transmits
    nerve impulses to other cells. The axon branches at the end, forming
    **axon terminals** . These are the points where the neuron
    communicates with other cells.

#### Myelin Sheath {#14.html#x-ck12-TXllbGluIFNoZWF0aA.._15-him}

The axon of many neurons has an outer layer called a **myelin sheath**
(see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTAyLW5ldXJvbi1zdHJ1Y3R1cmU.) ).
**Myelin** is a lipid produced by a type of a glial cell known as a
**Schwann cell** . The myelin sheath acts like a layer of insulation,
similar to the plastic that encases an electrical cord. Regularly spaced
nodes, or gaps, in the myelin sheath allow nerve impulses to skip along
the axon very rapidly.

#### Types of Neurons {#14.html#x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgTmV1cm9ucw.._15-nva}

Neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry nerve
impulses.

-   **Sensory neurons** carry nerve impulses from tissues and organs to
    the spinal cord and brain.
-   **Motor neurons** carry nerve impulses from the brain and spinal
    cord to muscles and glands (see **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTAzLWF4b24.) ).
-   **Interneurons** carry nerve impulses back and forth between sensory
    and motor neurons.

**How does a nervous system signal move from one cell to the next?**

It literally jumps by way of a chemical transmitter. Notice the two
cells are not connected, but separated by a small gap. The synapse. The
space between a neuron and the next cell.

### Nerve Impulses {#14.html#x-ck12-TmVydmUgSW1wdWxzZXM._16-lyl}

Nerve impulses are electrical in nature. They result from a difference
in electrical charge across the plasma membrane of a neuron. How does
this difference in electrical charge come about? The answer involves
**ions** , which are electrically charged atoms or molecules.

#### Resting Potential {#14.html#x-ck12-UmVzdGluZyBQb3RlbnRpYWw._16-cv0}

When a neuron is not actively transmitting a nerve impulse, it is in a
resting state, ready to transmit a nerve impulse. During the resting
state, the **sodium-potassium pump** maintains a difference in charge
across the cell membrane (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA0LXJlc3RpbmctcG90ZW50aWFs) ). It uses
energy in ATP to pump positive sodium ions (Na ^+^ ) out of the cell and
potassium ions (K ^+^ ) into the cell. As a result, the inside of the
neuron is negatively charged compared to the extracellular fluid
surrounding the neuron. This is due to many more positively charged ions
outside the cell compared to inside the cell. This difference in
electrical charge is called the **resting potential.**

</div>

#### Action Potential {#14.html#x-ck12-QWN0aW9uIFBvdGVudGlhbA.._16-mdt}

A **nerve impulse** is a sudden reversal of the electrical charge across
the membrane of a resting neuron. The reversal of charge is called an
**action potential.** It begins when the neuron receives a chemical
signal from another cell. The signal causes gates in sodium ion channels
to open, allowing positive sodium ions to flow back into the cell. As a
result, the inside of the cell becomes positively charged compared to
the outside of the cell. This reversal of charge ripples down the axon
very rapidly as an electric current (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA1LWFjdGlvbi1wb3RlbnRpYWw.) ). You can
watch a detailed animation of an action potential at this link:

**Figure 14.34**

An action potential speeds along an axon in milliseconds.

</div>

In neurons with myelin sheaths, ions flow across the membrane only at
the nodes between sections of myelin. As a result, the action potential
jumps along the axon membrane from node to node, rather than spreading
smoothly along the entire membrane. This increases the speed at which it
travels.

The action potential is discussed at

#### The Synapse {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN5bmFwc2U._16-lbn}

The place where an axon terminal meets another cell is called a
**synapse** . The axon terminal and other cell are separated by a narrow
space known as a **synaptic cleft** (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA2LVN5bmFwc2U.) ). When an action
potential reaches the axon terminal, the axon terminal releases
molecules of a chemical called a **neurotransmitter** . The
neurotransmitter molecules travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to
receptors on the membrane of the other cell. If the other cell is a
neuron, this starts an action potential in the other cell. You can view
animations of neurotransmission at a synapse at the following links:

**The human brain. The "control center." What does it control?**

Practically everything. From breathing and heartbeat to reasoning,
memory, and language. And it is the main part of the central nervous
system.

### Central Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2VudHJhbCBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbQ.._17-mvw}

The nervous system has two main divisions: the central nervous system
and the peripheral nervous system (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA3LXR3by1tYWluLWRpdmlzaW9ucw..) ). The
**central nervous system (CNS)** includes the brain and spinal cord (see
**Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA4LWNlbnRyYWwtbmVydm91cy1zeXN0ZW0.) ).
You can see an overview of the central nervous system at this link:

#### The Brain {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEJyYWlu_17-dny}

The **brain** is the most complex organ of the human body and the
control center of the nervous system. It contains an astonishing 100
billion neurons! The brain controls such mental processes as reasoning,
imagination, memory, and language. It also interprets information from
the senses. In addition, it controls basic physical processes such as
breathing and heartbeat.

The brain has three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain
stem. These parts are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTA5LVBhcnRzLW9mLXRoZS1CcmFpbi1iYXNpYw..)
and described in this section. For a video of the parts of the brain and
their functions, go to this link:

</div>

-   The **cerebrum** is the largest part of the brain. It controls
    conscious functions such as reasoning, language, sight, touch,
    and hearing. It is divided into two hemispheres, or halves. The
    hemispheres are very similar but not identical to one another. They
    are connected by a thick bundle of axons deep within the brain. Each
    hemisphere is further divided into the four lobes shown in
    **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTEwLUxvYmVzLUNlcmVicnVt) .
-   The **cerebellum** is just below the cerebrum. It coordinates
    body movements. Many nerve pathways link the cerebellum with motor
    neurons throughout the body.
-   The **brain stem** is the lowest part of the brain. It connects the
    rest of the brain with the spinal cord and passes nerve impulses
    between the brain and spinal cord. It also controls unconscious
    functions such as heart rate and breathing.

#### Spinal Cord {#14.html#x-ck12-U3BpbmFsIENvcmQ._17-tiv}

The **spinal cord** is a thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue that
extends from the brainstem and continues down the center of the back to
the pelvis. It is protected by the **vertebrae** , which encase it. The
spinal cord serves as an information superhighway, passing messages from
the body to the brain and from the brain to the body.

**How does the signal get to your toes?**

If the brain controls practically everything, how does the signal get to
your toes? Or your legs? Or arms? By way of the peripheral nervous
system, or all the nerves shown here other than the brain and spinal
cord. Notice how they go everywhere.

### Peripheral Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-UGVyaXBoZXJhbCBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbQ.._18-2ve}

The **peripheral nervous system (PNS)** consists of all the nervous
tissue that lies outside the central nervous system. It is shown in
yellow in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTExLVBlcmlwaGVyYWwtTmVydmVz) . It is
connected to the central nervous system by nerves. A **nerve** is a
cable-like bundle of axons. Some nerves are very long. The longest human
nerve is the sciatic nerve. It runs from the spinal cord in the lower
back down the left leg all the way to the toes of the left foot. Like
the nervous system as a whole, the peripheral nervous system also has
two divisions: the sensory division and the motor division.

-   The **sensory division** of the PNS carries sensory information from
    the body to the central nervous system.
-   The **motor division** of the PNS carries nerve impulses from the
    central nervous system to muscles and glands throughout the body.
    The nerve impulses stimulate muscles to contract and glands to
    secrete hormones. The motor division of the peripheral nervous
    system is further divided into the somatic and autonomic
    nervous systems.

The nerves of the peripheral nervous system are shown in blue in this
image. Can you identify the sciatic nerve?

</div>

#### Somatic Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-U29tYXRpYyBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbQ.._18-0sy}

The **somatic nervous system (SNS)** controls mainly voluntary
activities that are under conscious control. It is made up of nerves
that are connected to skeletal muscles. Whenever you perform a conscious
movement, from signing your name to riding your bike, your somatic
nervous system is responsible.

The somatic nervous system also controls some unconscious movements,
called reflexes. A **reflex** is a very rapid motor response that is not
directed by the brain. In a reflex, nerve impulses travel to and from
the spinal cord in a **reflex arc** , like the one in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTEyLVJlZmxleC1BcmM.) . In this example,
the person jerks his hand away from the flame without any conscious
thought. It happens unconsciously because the nerve impulses bypass the
brain.

responses be beneficial to the organism?

</div>

#### Autonomic Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-QXV0b25vbWljIE5lcnZvdXMgU3lzdGVt_18-ypr}

All other involuntary activities not under conscious control are the
responsibility of the **autonomic nervous system (ANS)** . Nerves of the
ANS are connected to glands and internal organs. They control basic
physical functions such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and sweat
production. The autonomic nervous system also has two subdivisions: the
sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division. You can watch an
animation comparing these two subdivisions at this link:
[http://www.garyfisk.com/anim/autonomicns.swf](autonomicns.swf) .

-   The **sympathetic division** deals with emergency situations. It
    prepares the body for “fight or flight.” Do you get clammy palms or
    a racing heart when you have to play a solo or give a speech? Nerves
    of the sympathetic division control these responses.
-   The **parasympathetic division** controls involuntary activities
    that are not emergencies. For example, it controls the organs of
    your digestive system so they can break down the food you eat.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._18-dmq}

-   The peripheral nervous system consists of all the nervous tissue
    that lies outside the central nervous system. It is connected to the
    central nervous system by nerves.
-   The peripheral nervous system has several divisions and subdivisions
    that transmit nerve impulses between the central nervous system and
    the rest of the body.

**Name the five senses.**

Hearing, sight, taste, touch, and smell. But how do we hear, see, taste,
touch and smell? It all has to do, obviously, with the nervous system.

### The Senses {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNlbnNlcw.._19-caq}

The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes
several sense organs—the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and skin. Each sense
organ has special cells, called **sensory receptors** , that respond to
a particular type of stimulus. For example, the nose has sensory
receptors that respond to chemicals, which we perceive as odors. Sensory
receptors send nerve impulses to **sensory nerves** , which carry the
nerve impulses to the central nervous system. The brain then interprets
the nerve impulses to form a response.

#### Sight {#14.html#x-ck12-U2lnaHQ._19-5ap}

**Sight** is the ability to sense light, and the eye is the organ that
senses light. Light first passes through the **cornea** of the eye,
which is a clear outer layer that protects the eye (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTEzLWh1bWFuLWV5ZQ..) ). Light enters
the eye through an opening called the **pupil** . The light then passes
through the **lens** , which focuses it on the **retina** at the back of
the eye. The retina contains light receptor cells. These cells send
nerve impulses to the **optic nerve** , which carries the impulses to
the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and “tells” us what we are
seeing. To learn more about the eye and the sense of sight, you can go
to the link below.

The eye is the organ that senses light and allows us to see.

</div>

#### Hearing {#14.html#x-ck12-SGVhcmluZw.._19-flu}

**Hearing** is the ability to sense sound waves, and the ear is the
organ that senses sound. Sound waves enter the **auditory canal** and
travel to the **eardrum** (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE0LUh1bWFuLUVhcg..) ). They strike the
eardrum and make it vibrate. The vibrations then travel through several
other structures inside the ear and reach the cochlea. The **cochlea**
is a coiled tube filled with liquid. The liquid moves in response to the
vibrations, causing tiny hair cells lining the cochlea to bend. In
response, the hair cells send nerve impulses to the **auditory nerve** ,
which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the
impulses and “tells” us what we are hearing.

**Figure 14.43**

The ear is the organ that senses sound waves and allows us to hear. It
also senses body position so we can keep our balance.

</div>

#### Balance {#14.html#x-ck12-QmFsYW5jZQ.._19-5tk}

The ears are also responsible for the sense of balance. **Balance** is
the ability to sense and maintain body position. The **semicircular
canals** inside the ear (see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE0LUh1bWFuLUVhcg..) ) contain fluid
that moves when the head changes position. Tiny hairs lining the
semicircular canals sense movement of the fluid. In response, they send
nerve impulses to the **vestibular nerve** , which carries the impulses
to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and sends messages to
the peripheral nervous system. This system maintains the body’s balance
by triggering contractions of skeletal muscles as needed.

#### Taste and Smell {#14.html#x-ck12-VGFzdGUgYW5kIFNtZWxs_19-kd9}

**Taste** and **smell** are both abilities to sense chemicals. Like
other sense receptors, both **taste receptors** and **odor receptors**
send nerve impulses to the brain, and the brain “tells” use what we are
tasting or smelling.

Taste receptors are found in tiny bumps on the tongue called **taste
buds** (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE1LXRhc3RlLWJ1ZHM.) ). There are
separate taste receptors for sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and meaty
tastes. The meaty taste is called *umami* . You can learn more about
taste receptors and the sense of taste by watching the animation at the
following link:

</div>

Odor receptors line the passages of the nose (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE2LW9kb3ItcmVjZXB0b3Jz) ). They sense
chemicals in the air. In fact, odor receptors can sense hundreds of
different chemicals. Did you ever notice that food seems to have less
taste when you have a stuffy nose? This occurs because the sense of
smell contributes to the sense of taste, and a stuffy nose interferes
with the ability to smell.

#### Touch {#14.html#x-ck12-VG91Y2g._19-mkw}

**Touch** is the ability to sense pressure. **Pressure receptors** are
found mainly in the skin. They are especially concentrated on the
tongue, lips, face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Some
touch receptors sense differences in temperature or pain. How do pain
receptors help maintain homeostasis? (Hint: What might happen if we
couldn’t feel pain?)

*If you kids don't like broccoli, it may not be their fault, it may just
be their genes talking.* Dr. Danielle Reed is a geneticist working to
understand the genetics of taste. Can all people detect the same tastes?
No. Why not? It has to do with a person's genes. People may actually
taste foods differently.

**Is coffee a drug?**

Maybe. But that doesn't necessarily mean it is bad for you. Looks tasty,
though. Other than taste, why do many people have a cup of coffee in the
morning? Does it help them wake up? For many people, it does. Why? The
caffeine in the coffee stimulates the central nervous system. This drug
is one of the milder drugs affecting the nervous system.

### Drugs and the Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-RHJ1Z3MgYW5kIHRoZSBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbQ.._20-jqx}

A **drug** is any chemical that affects the body’s structure or
function. Many drugs, including both legal and illegal drugs, are
**psychoactive drugs** . This means that they affect the central nervous
system, generally by influencing the transmission of nerve impulses. For
example, some psychoactive drugs mimic neurotransmitters. At the link
below, you can watch an animation showing how psychoactive drugs affect
the brain.
[http://www.thirteen.org/closetohome/animation/neuron-main.html](neuron-main.html)

#### Examples of Psychoactive Drugs {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhhbXBsZXMgb2YgUHN5Y2hvYWN0aXZlIERydWdz_20-4xm}

**Caffeine** is an example of a psychoactive drug. It is found in coffee
and many other products (see **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6Y2FmZmVpbmUtY29udGVudA..) ). Caffeine is
a central nervous system **stimulant** . Like other stimulant drugs, it
makes you feel more awake and alert. Other psychoactive drugs include
alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. Each has a different effect on the
central nervous system. Alcohol, for example, is a **depressant** . It
has the opposite effects of a stimulant like caffeine.

  Product                         Caffeine Content (mg)
  ------------------------------- -----------------------
  Coffee (8 oz)                   130
  Tea (8 oz)                      55
  Cola (8 oz)                     25
  Coffee ice cream (8 oz)         60
  Hot cocoa (8 oz)                10
  Dark chocolate candy (1.5 oz)   30

#### Drug Abuse and Addiction {#14.html#x-ck12-RHJ1ZyBBYnVzZSBhbmQgQWRkaWN0aW9u_20-0sl}

Psychoactive drugs may bring about changes in mood that users find
desirable, so the drugs may be abused. **Drug abuse** is use of a drug
without the advice of a medical professional and for reasons not
originally intended. Continued use of a psychoactive drug may lead to
**drug addiction** , in which the drug user is unable to stop using the
drug. Over time, a drug user may need more of the drug to get the
desired effect. This can lead to drug **overdose** and death.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._20-otx}

-   Drugs are chemicals that affect the body’s structure or function.
-   Psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine and alcohol, affect the central
    nervous system by influencing the transmission of nerve impulses in
    the brain.
-   Psychoactive drugs may be abused and lead to drug addiction.

**Ever had a headache that just won't go away?**

We all get headaches. Headaches are a relatively minor problem
associated with the nervous system. But what about more serious issues
of the nervous system? As you can probably imagine, these can be
extremely serious.

### Disorders of the Nervous System {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlzb3JkZXJzIG9mIHRoZSBOZXJ2b3VzIFN5c3RlbQ.._21-9xg}

There are several different types of problems that can affect the
nervous system.

-   **Vascular disorders** involve problems with blood flow. For
    example, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to part
    of the brain. Brain cells die quickly if their oxygen supply is
    cut off. This may cause paralysis and loss of other normal
    functions, depending on the part of the brain that is damaged.
-   Nervous tissue may become infected by microorganisms. **Meningitis**
    , for example, is caused by a viral or bacterial infection of the
    tissues covering the brain. This may cause the brain to swell and
    lead to brain damage and death.
-   **Encephalitis** <span class="c2">  is a brain infection  </span>
    <span class="c2"> most often caused by viruses. The immune system
    tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight off
    other infections. But sometimes this can do more harm than good. The
    immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain. With no
    room to expand, the brain pushes against the skull. This may injure
    the brain and even cause death. Medicines can help fight some viral
    infections of the brain, but not all infections. </span>
-   Brain or spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis and
    other disabilities. Injuries to peripheral nerves can cause
    localized pain or numbness.
-   Abnormal brain functions can occur for a variety of reasons.
    Examples include headaches, such as migraine headaches, and
    epilepsy, in which seizures occur.
-   Nervous tissue may degenerate, or break down. **Alzheimer’s
    disease** is an example of this type of disorder, as is
    **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis** , or ALS. ALS is also known as Lou
    Gehrig's disease. It leads to a gradual loss of higher
    brain functions. For a detailed video discussion of Alzheimer's
    disease see the visualMD.com at
    [http://www.thevisualmd.com/health\_centers/neurological\_health/what\_is\_alzheimer\_s/what\_is\_alzheimer\_s\_disease\_video](what_is_alzheimer_s_disease_video) .
-   In addition to ALS and Alzheimer's disease,  <span class="c2"> other
    serious nervous system diseases include multiple sclerosis,
    Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. T <span class="c2">
    hese diseases rarely, if ever, occur in young people. Their causes
    and symptoms are listed below ( </span> **Table** <span class="c2">
      </span>
    [below](Diseases_of_the_Nervous_System#table:IncurableNervousDiseases)
    <span class="c2"> ). The diseases have no known cure, but medicines
    may help control their symptoms. </span> </span>

**What's a hormone?**

This messenger pigeon is delivering a letter, making sure it gets to
where it needs to go. It could be said that hormones are biological
messengers, and they originate from the endocrine system. The nervous
system isn’t the only message-relaying system of the human body. The
endocrine system also carries messages. The endocrine system is a system
of glands that release chemical messenger molecules into the
bloodstream. The messenger molecules are hormones. Hormones act slowly
compared with the rapid transmission of electrical messages by the
nervous system. They must travel through the bloodstream to the cells
they affect, and this takes time. On the other hand, because endocrine
hormones are released into the bloodstream, they travel throughout the
body. As a result, endocrine hormones can affect many cells and have
body-wide effects.

### Glands of the Endocrine System {#14.html#x-ck12-R2xhbmRzIG9mIHRoZSBFbmRvY3JpbmUgU3lzdGVt_22-h16}

secretes **hormones** . Some of its hormones “tell” the pituitary gland
either to secrete or to stop secreting its hormones. In this way, the
hypothalamus provides a link between the nervous and endocrine systems.
The hypothalamus also produces hormones that directly regulate body
processes. These hormones travel to the pituitary gland, which stores
them until they are needed. The hormones include antidiuretic hormone
and oxytocin.

-   **Antidiuretic hormone** stimulates the kidneys to conserve water by
    producing more concentrated urine.
-   **Oxytocin** stimulates the contractions of childbirth, among
    other functions.

The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are located close together at the
base of the brain.

#### Pituitary Gland {#14.html#x-ck12-UGl0dWl0YXJ5IEdsYW5k_22-bfj}

The pea-sized **pituitary gland** is attached to the hypothalamus by a
thin stalk (see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE4LUh5cG90aGFsYW11cw..) ). It consists
of two bulb-like lobes. The posterior (back) lobe stores hormones from
the hypothalamus. The anterior (front) lobe secretes pituitary hormones.
Several pituitary hormones and their effects are listed in **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6cGl0dWl0YXJ5LWhvcm1vbmVz) . Most
pituitary hormones control other endocrine glands. That’s why the
pituitary is often called the “master gland” of the endocrine system.

  Hormone                              Target            Effect(s)
  ------------------------------------ ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)   Adrenal glands    Stimulates the cortex of each adrenal gland to secrete its hormones.
  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)    Thyroid gland     Stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormone.
  Growth hormone (GH)                  Body cells        Stimulates body cells to synthesize proteins and grow.
  Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)   Ovaries, testes   Stimulates the ovaries to develop mature eggs; stimulates the testes to produce sperm.
  Luteinizing hormone (LH)             Ovaries, testes   Stimulates the ovaries and testes to secrete sex hormones; stimulates the ovaries to release eggs.
  Prolactin (PRL)                      Mammary glands    Stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk.

#### Other Endocrine Glands {#14.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgRW5kb2NyaW5lIEdsYW5kcw.._22-t3d}

Other glands of the endocrine system are described below. You can refer
to **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE3LWVuZG9jcmluZS1zeXN0ZW0.) to see
where they are located.

-   The **thyroid gland** is a large gland in the neck. Thyroid hormones
    increase the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body. They
    control how quickly cells use energy and make proteins.
-   The two **parathyroid glands** are located behind the thyroid gland.
    Parathyroid hormone helps keep the level of calcium in the blood
    within a narrow range. It stimulates bone cells to dissolve calcium
    in bone matrix and release it into the blood.
-   The **pineal gland** is a tiny gland located at the base of
    the brain. It secretes the hormone **melatonin** . This hormone
    controls sleep-wake cycles and several other processes.
-   The **pancreas** is located near the stomach. Its hormones include
    insulin and glucagon. These two hormones work together to control
    the level of glucose in the blood. **Insulin** causes excess blood
    glucose to be taken up by the liver, which stores the glucose
    as glycogen. **Glucagon** stimulates the liver to break down
    glycogen into glucose and release it back into the blood. The
    pancreas also secretes digestive enzymes into the digestive tract.
-   The two **adrenal glands** are located above the kidneys. Each gland
    has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex,
    secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with
    stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of
    minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called
    the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline,
    which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example,
    adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to
    the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the
    link below.

[http://www.abpischools.org.uk/page/modules/hormones/horm8.cfm?coSiteNavigation\_allTopic=1](horm8.cfm?coSiteNavigation_allTopic=1)

-   The **gonads** secrete sex hormones. The male gonads are called
    **testes** . They secrete the male sex hormone testosterone. The
    female gonads are called **ovaries** . They secrete the female sex
    hormone estrogen. Sex hormones are involved in the changes
    of puberty. They also control the production of gametes by
    the gonads.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._22-brs}

-   The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones into
    the bloodstream.
-   The endocrine system is regulated by a part of the brain called the
    hypothalamus, which also secretes hormones.
-   The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland, which is called the
    “master gland” of the endocrine system because its hormones regulate
    other endocrine glands.
-   Other endocrine glands include the thyroid gland and pancreas.

**Steroid hormones. How do they work?**

As hormones, they are the messengers of the endocrine system. Obviously
they must change something in the cell.

### How Hormones Work {#14.html#x-ck12-SG93IEhvcm1vbmVzIFdvcms._23-gcp}

**Hormones** are the messenger molecules of the endocrine system.
Endocrine hormones travel throughout the body in the blood. However,
each hormone affects only certain cells, called target cells. A **target
cell** is the type of cell on which a hormone has an effect. A target
cell is affected by a particular hormone because it has **receptor
proteins** that are specific to that hormone. A hormone travels through
the bloodstream until it finds a target cell with a matching receptor it
can bind to. When the hormone binds to a receptor, it causes a change
within the cell. Exactly how this works depends on whether the hormone
is a **steroid hormone** or a **non-steroid hormone** . At the link
below, you can watch an animation that shows how both types of hormones
work.

#### Steroid Hormones {#14.html#x-ck12-U3Rlcm9pZCBIb3Jtb25lcw.._23-n2c}

Steroid hormones are made of lipids, such as phospholipids and
cholesterol. They are fat soluble, so they can diffuse across the plasma
membrane of target cells and bind with receptors in the cytoplasm of the
cell (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTE5LVN0ZXJvaWQtSG9ybW9uZS1NZWNoYW5pc20.)
). The steroid hormone and receptor form a complex that moves into the
nucleus and influences the expression of genes, essentially acting as a
transcription factor. Examples of steroid hormones include cortisol and
sex hormones.

**Figure 14.48**

A steroid hormone crosses the plasma membrane of a target cell and binds
with a receptor inside the cell.

</div>

#### Non-Steroid Hormones {#14.html#x-ck12-Tm9uLVN0ZXJvaWQgSG9ybW9uZXM._23-3f0}

Non-steroid hormones are made of amino acids. They are not fat soluble,
so they cannot diffuse across the plasma membrane of target cells.
Instead, a non-steroid hormone binds to a receptor on the cell membrane
(see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTIwLU5vbi1zdGVyb2lkLUhvcm1vbmUtTWVjaGFuaXNt)
). The binding of the hormone triggers an enzyme inside the cell
membrane. The enzyme activates another molecule, called the **second
messenger** , which influences processes inside the cell. Most endocrine
hormones are non-steroid hormones, including insulin and thyroid
hormones.

-   Hormones work by binding to protein receptors either inside target
    cells or on their plasma membranes.
-   The binding of a steroid hormone forms a hormone-receptor complex
    that affects gene expression in the nucleus of the target cell.
-   The binding of a non-steroid hormone activates a second messenger

**On or off?**

Hormones alter conditions inside the cell, usually in response to a
stimulus. That means they are activated at specific times. So they must
be turned on and then turned back off. What turns these hormones and
their responses on or off?

### Hormone Regulation: Feedback Mechanisms {#14.html#x-ck12-SG9ybW9uZSBSZWd1bGF0aW9uOiBGZWVkYmFjayBNZWNoYW5pc21z_24-2ze}

Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for
homeostasis. But what controls the hormones themselves? Most hormones
are regulated by feedback mechanisms. A **feedback mechanism** is a loop
in which a product feeds back to control its own production. Most
hormone feedback mechanisms involve **negative feedback loops** .
Negative feedback keeps the concentration of a hormone within a narrow
range.

#### Negative Feedback {#14.html#x-ck12-TmVnYXRpdmUgRmVlZGJhY2s._24-8ws}

**Negative feedback** occurs when a product feeds back to decrease its
own production. This type of feedback brings things back to normal
whenever they start to become too extreme. The thyroid gland is a good
example of this type of regulation. It is controlled by the negative
feedback loop shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTIxLVJlZ3VsYXRpb24tVGh5cm9pZC1HbGFuZA..)
. You can also watch an animation of this process at the link below.

![Regulation of the thyroid
gland](ck12_14_files/20150914105647316667.jpeg "Regulation of the thyroid gland")

**Figure 14.50**

The thyroid gland is regulated by a negative feedback loop. The loop
includes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in addition to the
thyroid.

</div>

Here’s how thyroid regulation works. The hypothalamus secretes
thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or TRH. TRH stimulates the pituitary
gland to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. TSH, in turn,
stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones. When the level of
thyroid hormones is high enough, the hormones feedback to stop the
hypothalamus from secreting TRH and the pituitary from secreting TSH.
Without the stimulation of TSH, the thyroid gland stops secreting its
hormones. Soon, the level of thyroid hormone starts to fall too low.
What do you think happens next?

This process is discussed at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vae5CcaPN\_8](watch?v=Vae5CcaPN_8)
(1:35).

Negative feedback also controls insulin secretion by the pancreas. You
can interact with a feedback loop of this process at the link below.
[http://www.abpischools.org.uk/page/modules/hormones/horm6.cfm?coSiteNavigation\_allTopic=1](horm6.cfm?coSiteNavigation_allTopic=1)

#### Positive feedback {#14.html#x-ck12-UG9zaXRpdmUgZmVlZGJhY2s._24-pex}

**Positive feedback** occurs when a product feeds back to increase its
own production. This causes conditions to become increasingly extreme.
An example of positive feedback is milk production by a mother for her
baby. As the baby suckles, nerve messages from the nipple cause the
pituitary gland to secrete prolactin. Prolactin, in turn, stimulates the
mammary glands to produce milk, so the baby suckles more. This causes
more prolactin to be secreted and more milk to be produced. This example
is one of the few positive feedback mechanisms in the human body. What
do you think would happen if milk production by the mammary glands was
controlled by negative feedback instead?

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._24-kcp}

-   Most hormones are controlled by negative feedback, in which the
    hormone feeds back to decrease its own production. This type of
    feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become
    too extreme.
-   Positive feedback is much less common because it causes conditions
    to become increasingly extreme.

**How tall can a person become?**

This may be an exaggeration, but the world's tallest person, Robert
Pershing Wadlow, stood almost nine feet tall when he died at the age of
22. Is growing that tall due to a problem with the endocrine system?

### Endocrine System Disorders {#14.html#x-ck12-RW5kb2NyaW5lIFN5c3RlbSBEaXNvcmRlcnM._25-rv9}

Diseases of the endocrine system are relatively common. An endocrine
disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough
hormone. When too much hormone is secreted, it is called
**hypersecretion** . When not enough hormone is secreted, it is called
**hyposecretion** .

#### Hypersecretion {#14.html#x-ck12-SHlwZXJzZWNyZXRpb24._25-jme}

Hypersecretion by an endocrine gland is often caused by a tumor. For
example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause hypersecretion of
growth hormone. If this occurs in childhood, it results in very long
arms and legs and abnormally tall stature by adulthood. The condition is
commonly known as **gigantism** (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTIyLWdpZ2FudGlzbQ..) ). See *Giants -
Part 1 - Pituitary Gigantism and Acromegaly* at

Hypersecretion of growth hormone leads to abnormal growth, often called
gigantism.

</div>

#### Hyposecretion {#14.html#x-ck12-SHlwb3NlY3JldGlvbg.._25-bk8}

Destruction of hormone-secreting cells of a gland may result in not
enough of a hormone being secreted. This occurs in **type 1 diabetes** .
In this case, the body’s own immune system attacks and destroys cells of
the pancreas that secrete insulin, making type 1 diabetes an autoimmune
disease. A person with type 1 diabetes must frequently monitor the level
of glucose in the blood (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIyLTIzLUJsb29kLUdsdWNvc2UtTGV2ZWw.) ). If
the level of blood glucose is too high, insulin is injected to bring it
under control. If it is too low, a small amount of sugar is consumed.

on a test strip, which is read by a meter.

</div>

#### Hormone Resistance {#14.html#x-ck12-SG9ybW9uZSBSZXNpc3RhbmNl_25-kcm}

In some cases, an endocrine gland secretes a normal amount of hormone,
but target cells do not respond to the hormone. Often, this is because
target cells have become resistant to the hormone. **Type 2 diabetes**
is an example of this type of endocrine disorder. In type 2 diabetes,
body cells do not respond to normal amounts of insulin. As a result,
cells do not take up glucose and the amount of glucose in the blood
becomes too high. This type of diabetes is usually treated with
medication and diet. The addition of extra insulin to the treatment can
help some patients.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._25-sp0}

-   Endocrine system disorders usually involve the secretion of too much
    or not enough hormone. For example, a tumor of the adrenal gland may
    lead to excessive secretion of growth hormone, which
    causes gigantism.
-   In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not secrete enough insulin,
    which causes high levels of glucose in the blood.

**What's the most active muscle in the body?**

The human heart. An absolutely remarkable organ. Obviously, its main
function is to pump blood throughout the body. And it does this
extremely well. On average, this muscular organ will beat about 100,000
times in one day and about 35 million times in a year. During an average
lifetime, the human heart will beat more than 2.5 billion times.

### The Circulatory System {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIENpcmN1bGF0b3J5IFN5c3RlbQ.._26-sru}

The **circulatory system** can be compared to a system of
interconnected, one-way roads that range from superhighways to back
alleys. Like a network of roads, the job of the circulatory system is to

in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTAxLWNpcmN1bGF0b3J5LWZ1bmN0aW9u) , the
materials carried by the circulatory system include hormones, oxygen,
cellular wastes, and nutrients from digested food. Transport of all
these materials is necessary to maintain homeostasis of the body. The
main components of the circulatory system are the **heart, blood
vessels,** and **blood.**

### The Heart {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEhlYXJ0_26-lex}

The heart is a muscular organ in the chest. It consists mainly of
cardiac muscle tissue and pumps blood through blood vessels by repeated,
rhythmic contractions. The heart has four chambers, as shown in
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTAyLWhlYXJ0LWJsb29kLWZsb3c.)
: two upper **atria** (singular, **atrium** ) and two lower
**ventricles** . Valves between chambers keep blood flowing through the
heart in just one direction.

#### Blood Flow Through the Heart {#14.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgRmxvdyBUaHJvdWdoIHRoZSBIZWFydA.._26-c29}

Blood flows through the heart in two separate loops, which are indicated
by the arrows in **Figure**  above. You can think of them as a "left
side loop" and a "right side loop." The right side of the heart collects
oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps the blood to the lungs. In the
lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen obtained by the blood. The
left side of the heart carries the oxygen-rich blood back from the lungs
and pumps it to the rest of the body. The blood delivers oxygen to the
body's cells, returning the oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.

You can watch an animation of the heart pumping blood at this link:
[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hhw/hhw\_pumping.html](hhw_pumping.html)
.

1.  Blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart. The right
    atrium pumps the blood to the right ventricle, which pumps it to the
    lungs. 
2.  Blood from the lungs enters the left atrium of the heart. The left
    atrium pumps the blood to the left ventricle, which pumps it to
    the body.

#### Heartbeat {#14.html#x-ck12-SGVhcnRiZWF0_26-if9}

Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle contracts without stimulation by
the nervous system. Instead, specialized cardiac muscle cells send out
electrical impulses that stimulate the contractions. As a result, the
atria and ventricles normally contract with just the right timing to
keep blood pumping efficiently through the heart. You can watch an
animation to see how this happens at this link:
[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hhw/hhw\_electrical.html](hhw_electrical.html)
.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._26-dkn}

**How does blood travel around the body?**

Through blood vessels, of course. This image of veins is from William
Harvey's (1578-1657) *Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis
in Animalibus.* Harvey was the first to describe in detail the systemic
circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and body
by the heart.

### Blood Vessels {#14.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgVmVzc2Vscw.._27-u6q}

**Blood vessels** form a network throughout the body to transport blood
to all the body cells. There are three major types of blood vessels:
arteries, veins, and capillaries. All three are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTAzLUJsb29kLVZlc3NlbHM.) and described
below.

vessels](ck12_14_files/20150914105649207227.png "Various blood vessels")

**Figure 14.55**

Blood vessels include arteries, veins, and capillaries.

</div>

-   **Arteries** are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from
    the heart. They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of
    blood being pumped by the heart. Arteries generally carry
    oxygen-rich blood. The largest artery is the **aorta** , which
    receives blood directly from the heart.
-   **Veins** are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. This
    blood is no longer under much pressure, so many veins have valves
    that prevent backflow of blood. Veins generally carry
    deoxygenated blood. The largest vein is the **inferior vena cava** ,
    which carries blood from the lower body to the heart. The **superior
    vena cava** brings blood back to the heart from the upper body.
-   **Capillaries** are the smallest type of blood vessels. They connect
    very small arteries and veins. The exchange of gases and other
    substances between cells and the blood takes place across the
    extremely thin walls of capillaries.

#### Blood Vessels and Homeostasis {#14.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgVmVzc2VscyBhbmQgSG9tZW9zdGFzaXM._27-9qp}

Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting
(becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in
response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine
system. **Constriction** occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels
contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the
vessels (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTA0LVZhc29jb25zdHJpY3Rpb24tYW5kLWJsb29kLWZsb3c.)
). **Dilation** occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows
through the vessels.

**Figure 14.56**

When a blood vessel constricts, less blood can flow through it.

</div>

Constriction and dilation allow the circulatory system to change the
amount of blood flowing to different organs. For example, during a
fight-or-flight response, dilation and constriction of blood vessels
allow more blood to flow to skeletal muscles and less to flow to
digestive organs. Dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more
blood to flow to the body surface so the body can lose heat.
Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps
conserve body heat.

#### Blood Vessels and Blood Pressure {#14.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgVmVzc2VscyBhbmQgQmxvb2QgUHJlc3N1cmU._27-t4y}

The force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels is
called **blood pressure** . Blood pressure is highest in arteries and
lowest in veins. When you have your blood pressure checked, it is the
blood pressure in arteries that is measured. High blood pressure, or
**hypertension** , is a serious health risk but can often be controlled
with lifestyle changes or medication. You can learn more about
hypertension by watching the animation at this link:

**How does oxygen get into the blood?**

The main function of the circulatory system is to pump blood carrying
oxygen around the body. But how does that oxygen get into the blood in
the first place? You may already know that this occurs in the lungs. So
the blood must also be pumped to the lungs, and this happens separately
from the rest of the body.

### Pulmonary and Systemic Circulations {#14.html#x-ck12-UHVsbW9uYXJ5IGFuZCBTeXN0ZW1pYyBDaXJjdWxhdGlvbnM._28-sml}

The circulatory system actually consists of two separate systems:
pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. You can watch animations
of both systems at the following link.
[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/journey/phase2\_a1.html](phase2_a1.html)

#### Pulmonary Circulation {#14.html#x-ck12-UHVsbW9uYXJ5IENpcmN1bGF0aW9u_28-k1j}

**Pulmonary circulation** is the part of the circulatory system that
carries blood between the heart and lungs (the term “pulmonary” means
“of the lungs”). It is illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTA1LVB1bG1vbmFyeS1DaXJjdWl0) .
Deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle through pulmonary
arteries, which transport it to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood gives
up carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood then returns
to the left atrium of the heart through pulmonary veins.

#### Systemic Circulation {#14.html#x-ck12-U3lzdGVtaWMgQ2lyY3VsYXRpb24._28-beh}

**Don't smoke, eat healthy, and exercise. Why?**

Normally blood needs to flow freely through our arteries. Plaque in an
artery can restrict the flow of blood. As you can probably imagine, this
is not an ideal situation. And eating right, exercising, and not smoking
can help keep your arteries healthy.

### Cardiovascular Disease {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2FyZGlvdmFzY3VsYXIgRGlzZWFzZQ.._29-tql}

Diseases of the heart and blood vessels, called **cardiovascular
diseases (CVD)** , are very common. The leading cause of CVD is
atherosclerosis.

#### Atherosclerosis {#14.html#x-ck12-QXRoZXJvc2NsZXJvc2lz_29-ynd}

**Atherosclerosis** is the buildup of plaque inside arteries (see
**Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTA3LUFydGVyeS13aXRoLWFuZC13aXRob3V0LXBsYXF1ZQ..)
). **Plaque** consists of cell debris, cholesterol, and other
substances. Factors that contribute to plaque buildup include a high-fat
diet and smoking. As plaque builds up, it narrows the arteries and
reduces blood flow. You can watch an animation about atherosclerosis at
these links:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLonh7ZesKs](watch?v=fLonh7ZesKs) and
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRK7-DCDKEA](watch?v=qRK7-DCDKEA) .

![Cross section of plaque
development](ck12_14_files/20150914105650563065.jpeg "Cross section of plaque development")

**Figure 14.59**

The fatty material inside the artery on the right is plaque. Notice how
much narrower the artery has become. Less blood can flow through it than
the normal artery.

</div>

Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found
in most major arteries. It does not usually have any early symptoms.
Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol,
smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to
health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart
or the brain. A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart
attack. Blockage of the circulation in the brain can cause a stroke.

Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting
plenty of exercise and not smoking. A diet high in saturated fat and
cholesterol can raise your body's cholesterol levels, which can lead to
increased plaque in your arteries. Cholesterol and saturated fat are
found mostly in animal products, such as meat, eggs, milk and other
dairy products.

#### Coronary Heart Disease

Atherosclerosis of arteries that supply the heart muscle is called
**coronary heart disease** . This disease may or may not have symptoms,
such as chest pain. As the disease progresses, there is an increased
risk of heart attack. A **heart attack** occurs when the blood supply to
part of the heart muscle is blocked and cardiac muscle fibers die.
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the
United States.

The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can
cause a heart attack. The loss of oxygen to the heart muscle cause that
part of the tissue to die. Maybe one day, stem cell therapy will allow
for the replacement of the dead cells with new cardiac muscle cells. 

<div

![](ck12_14_files/20150914105650774070.png)

**Figure 14.60**

A blockage in a coronary artery stops oxygen from getting to part of the
heart muscle, so areas of the heart that depend on the blood flow from
the blocked artery are starved of oxygen.

</div>

#### <span class="c5"> Stroke </span> {#14.html#x-ck12-a5n_29-mij}

Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke.
A  **stroke**  is a loss of brain function due to a blockage of the
blood supply to the brain. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high
blood pressure, having a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol,
and smoking. The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low
blood pressure.

#### Preventing Cardiovascular Disease {#14.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBDYXJkaW92YXNjdWxhciBEaXNlYXNl_29-eia}

Many factors may increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease
and other CVDs. The risk of CVDs increases with age and is greater in
males than females at most ages. Having a close relative with CVD also
increases the risk. These factors cannot be controlled, but other risk
factors can, including smoking, lack of exercise, and high-fat diet. By
making healthy lifestyle choices, you can reduce your risk of developing
CVD.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._29-xco}

-   A disease that affects the heart or blood vessels is called a
    cardiovascular disease (CVD).
-   The leading cause of CVD is atherosclerosis, or the buildup of
    plaque inside arteries.

**What exactly is blood?**

All your cells need oxygen, as oxygen is the final electron acceptor
during cellular respiration. How do they get this oxygen? From blood.
Blood cells flow through the vessels of the human circulatory system.
But what exactly is blood? It does transport oxygen, but also has other
functions.

### Blood {#14.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2Q._30-rvb}

**Blood** is a fluid connective tissue. It circulates throughout the
body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. Blood in
arteries carries oxygen and nutrients to all the body’s cells. Blood in
veins carries carbon dioxide and other wastes away from the cells to be
excreted. Blood also defends the body against infection, repairs body
tissues, transports hormones, and controls the body’s pH.

#### Composition of Blood {#14.html#x-ck12-Q29tcG9zaXRpb24gb2YgQmxvb2Q._30-bjr}

The fluid part of blood is called **plasma** . It is a watery
golden-yellow liquid that contains many dissolved substances and blood
cells. Types of blood cells in plasma include red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTA4LWNlbGxzLWxlYXZpbmctYXJ0ZXJ5) ). You
can learn more about blood and its components by watching the animation

blood](ck12_14_files/20150914105651477809.jpeg "Components cells of blood")

**Figure 14.61**

Cells in blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets.

</div>

-   The trillions of **red blood cells** in blood plasma carry oxygen.
    Red blood cells contain **hemoglobin** , a protein with iron that
    binds with oxygen. Red blood cells are made in the marrow of long
    bones, rib bones, the skull, and the vertebrae. These cells survive
    for about 120 days, and then they are destroyed. Mature red blood
    cells lack a nucleus and other organelles, allowing for more
    hemoglobin, and therefore more oxygen to be carried by each cell.
-   **White blood cells** are generally larger than red blood cells but
    far fewer in number. They defend the body against foreign bacteria,
    viruses and other pathogens. For example, white blood cells called
    **phagocytes** swallow and destroy microorganisms and debris in the
    blood, neutrophils engulf bacteria and other parasites, and
    lymphocytes fight infections caused by bacteria and viruses.
-   **Platelets** are cell fragments involved in blood clotting. They
    stick to tears in blood vessels and to each other, forming a plug at
    the site of injury. They also release chemicals that are needed for
    clotting to occur.

#### Blood Type {#14.html#x-ck12-Qmxvb2QgVHlwZQ.._30-glo}

**Blood type** is a genetic characteristic associated with the presence
or absence of certain molecules, called **antigens** , on the surface of
red blood cells. The most commonly known blood types are the ABO and
Rhesus blood types.

-   **ABO blood type** is determined by two common antigens, often
    referred to simply as antigens A and B. A person may have blood type
    A (only antigen A), B (only antigen B), AB (both antigens), or O
    (no antigens).

<!-- -->

-   **Rhesus blood type** is determined by one common antigen. A person
    may either have the antigen (Rh ^+^ ) or lack the antigen (Rh ^-^ ).

Blood type is important for medical reasons. A person who needs a blood
transfusion must receive blood that is the same type as his or her own.
Otherwise, the transfused blood may cause a potentially life-threatening
reaction in the patient’s bloodstream. See
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj8ziUBMQhU](watch?v=zj8ziUBMQhU) for
more information on blood types.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._30-bsh}

**Where does oxygen get into blood?**

Red blood cells are like trucks that transport cargo on a highway
system. Their cargo is oxygen, and the highways are blood vessels. Where
do red blood cells pick up their cargo of oxygen? The answer is the
lungs. The lungs are organs of the respiratory system. The respiratory
system is the body system that brings air containing oxygen into the
body and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

### Respiration {#14.html#x-ck12-UmVzcGlyYXRpb24._31-ayj}

The job of the **respiratory system** is the exchange of gases between
the body and the outside air. This process, called **respiration** ,
actually consists of two parts. In the first part, oxygen in the air is
drawn into the body and carbon dioxide is released from the body through
the respiratory tract. In the second part, the circulatory system
delivers the oxygen to body cells and picks up carbon dioxide from the
cells in return. The **lungs** are organs of the respiratory system. It
is in the lungs where oxygen is transferred from the respiratory system
to the circulatory system.

The use of the word “respiration” in relation to gas exchange is
different from its use in the term **cellular respiration** . Recall
that cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells obtain
energy by “burning” glucose. Cellular respiration uses oxygen and
releases carbon dioxide. Respiration by the respiratory system supplies
the oxygen and takes away the carbon dioxide.

### Organs of the Respiratory System {#14.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW5zIG9mIHRoZSBSZXNwaXJhdG9yeSBTeXN0ZW0._32-7dt}

The organs of the respiratory system that bring air into the body are
divided among the upper **respiratory tract** and lower respiratory
tract. These organs are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTA5LXJlc3BpcmF0b3J5LXN5c3RlbQ..) . In
addition to the **lungs** , these organs include the pharynx, larynx,
trachea and bronchi. The **nasal cavity** is also part of the
respiratory system. The nose and nasal cavity filter, warm, and moisten
the air we inhale. Hairs and mucus produced in the nose trap particles
in the air and prevent them from reaching the lungs.

-   The **pharynx** is a long tube that is shared with the
    digestive system. Both food and air travel through the pharynx. 
-   The **larynx** , or voice box, contains vocal cords, which allow us
    to produce vocal sounds. Air passes through thin tissues in the
    larynx, producing sound.
-   The **trachea** , or wind pipe, is a long tube that leads down to
    the chest.
-   The trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and
    left **bronchi** , which branch into smaller bronchioles within
    each lung. The bronchioles lead to alveoli, the sites of
    gas exchange.

**Grapes. Why? What do these have in common with a breath of air?**

Below are the parts of the lungs where oxygen moves from the lungs into
the blood. If the alveoli below were purple, they could resemble a bunch
of grapes. Of course, as the alveoli are in the lungs, they must be very
small to provide enough area for the exchange of gases. In fact, there
are about 300 million alveoli in the adult lung.

### Journey of a Breath of Air {#14.html#x-ck12-Sm91cm5leSBvZiBhIEJyZWF0aCBvZiBBaXI._33-yml}

Take in a big breath of air through your nose. As you inhale, you may
feel the air pass down your throat and notice your chest expand. Now
exhale and observe the opposite events occurring. Inhaling and exhaling
may seem like simple actions, but they are just part of the complex
process of respiration, which includes these four steps:

1.  **Ventilation**
2.  **Pulmonary gas exchange**
3.  **Gas transport**
4.  **Peripheral gas exchange**

#### Ventilation {#14.html#x-ck12-VmVudGlsYXRpb24._33-zxu}

Respiration begins with ventilation. This is the process of moving air
in and out of the lungs. The **lungs** are the organs in which gas
exchange takes place between blood and air.

-   Air enters the respiratory system through the nose. As the air
    passes through the nasal cavity, mucus and hairs trap any particles
    in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it won’t harm
    delicate tissues of the lungs.
-   Next, the air passes through the **pharynx** , a long tube that is
    shared with the digestive system. A flap of connective tissue called
    the **epiglottis** closes when food is swallowed to prevent choking.
-   From the pharynx, air next passes through the **larynx** , or
    voice box. The larynx contains vocal cords, which allow us to
    produce vocal sounds.
-   After the larynx, air moves into the **trachea** , or wind pipe.
    This is a long tube that leads down to the chest.
-   In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the
    right and left **bronchi** . The bronchi contain cartilage, which
    prevents them from collapsing. Mucus in the bronchi traps any
    remaining particles in air. Tiny, hair-like structures called
    **cilia** line the bronchi and sweep the particles and mucus toward
    the throat so they can be expelled from the body.
-   Finally, air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called
    **bronchioles** . The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called
    **alveoli** .

#### Pulmonary Gas Exchange {#14.html#x-ck12-UHVsbW9uYXJ5IEdhcyBFeGNoYW5nZQ.._33-bzz}

Pulmonary gas exchange is the exchange of gases between inhaled air and
the blood. It occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Alveoli (singular,
alveolus) are grape-like clusters surrounded by networks of thin-walled
pulmonary capillaries. After you inhale, there is a greater
concentration of oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood of the
pulmonary capillaries, so oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the
blood across the capillaries (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTEwLUFsdmVvbGk.) ). Carbon dioxide, in
contrast, is more concentrated in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries
than in the alveoli, so it diffuses in the opposite direction.

This link has an animation of pulmonary gas exchange:

Alveoli are tiny sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place.

</div>

#### Gas Transport {#14.html#x-ck12-R2FzIFRyYW5zcG9ydA.._33-wuz}

After the blood in the pulmonary capillaries becomes saturated with
oxygen, it leaves the lungs and travels to the heart. The heart pumps
the oxygen-rich blood into arteries, which carry it throughout the body.
Eventually, the blood travels into capillaries that supply body tissues.
These capillaries are called **peripheral capillaries** .

#### Peripheral Gas Exchange {#14.html#x-ck12-UGVyaXBoZXJhbCBHYXMgRXhjaGFuZ2U._33-jgr}

The cells of the body have a much lower concentration of oxygen than
does the oxygenated blood in the peripheral capillaries. Therefore,
oxygen diffuses from the peripheral capillaries into body cells. Carbon
dioxide is produced by cells as a byproduct of cellular respiration, so
it is more concentrated in the cells than in the blood of the peripheral
capillaries. As a result, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite
direction.

#### Back to the Lungs {#14.html#x-ck12-QmFjayB0byB0aGUgTHVuZ3M._33-l9x}

The carbon dioxide from body cells travels in the blood from the
peripheral capillaries to veins and then to the heart. The heart pumps
the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the
alveoli. Then, the carbon dioxide passes out of the body through the
other structures of the respiratory system, bringing the process of
respiration full circle.

#### Gas Exchange and Homeostasis {#14.html#x-ck12-R2FzIEV4Y2hhbmdlIGFuZCBIb21lb3N0YXNpcw.._33-gst}

Gas exchange is needed to provide cells with the oxygen they need for
cellular respiration. Cells cannot survive for long without oxygen. Gas
exchange is also needed to carry away carbon dioxide waste. Some of the
carbon dioxide in the blood dissolves to form carbonic acid, which keeps
blood pH within a normal range.

Blood pH may become unbalanced if the rate of breathing is too fast or
too slow. When breathing is too fast, blood contains too little carbon
dioxide and becomes too basic. When breathing is too slow, blood
contains too much carbon dioxide and becomes too acidic. Clearly, to
maintain proper blood pH, the rate of breathing must be regulated.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._33-kp0}

-   Respiration begins with ventilation, the process of moving air into
    and out of the lungs.
-   Gas exchange in the lungs takes place across the thin walls of
    pulmonary arteries in tiny air sacs called alveoli.
-   Oxygenated blood is transported by the circulatory system from lungs
    to tissues throughout the body.
-   Gas exchange between blood and body cells occurs across the walls of
    peripheral capillaries.
-   Gas exchange helps maintain homeostasis by supplying cells with
    oxygen, carrying away carbon dioxide waste, and maintaining proper
    pH of the blood.

**What allows you to take a deep breath?**

Deep breath in…now blow out those candles. We've all done that. Taking
that deep breath in is an active process. You can usually feel your
chest move. Why? Obviously, muscles in your chest are doing the work.

### Regulation of Breathing {#14.html#x-ck12-UmVndWxhdGlvbiBvZiBCcmVhdGhpbmc._34-a9b}

To understand how breathing is regulated, you first need to understand
how breathing occurs.

#### How Breathing Occurs {#14.html#x-ck12-SG93IEJyZWF0aGluZyBPY2N1cnM._34-iuz}

**Inhaling** is an active movement that results from the contraction of
a muscle called the diaphragm. The **diaphragm** is large, sheet-like
muscle below the lungs (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTExLXJlc3BpcmF0aW9u) ). When the
diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen
move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases
air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than
outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm
relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity
decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of
the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon.

You can watch an animation showing how breathing occurs at this link:

**Figure 14.64**

Breathing depends on contractions of the diaphragm.

</div>

#### Control of Breathing {#14.html#x-ck12-Q29udHJvbCBvZiBCcmVhdGhpbmc._34-ged}

The regular, rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm are controlled by
the brain stem. It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the
autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon
dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it “tells” the
diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess
carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when
the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way,
breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._34-zcr}

-   Breathing occurs due to repeated contractions of a large muscle
    called the diaphragm.
-   The rate of breathing is regulated by the brain stem. It monitors
    the level of carbon dioxide in the blood and triggers faster or
    slower breathing as needed to keep the level within a narrow range.

**Does making ATP start with the lungs?**

The importance of a nice pair of healthy lungs is obvious. We all need
oxygen to get into our lungs, so the oxygen can be transferred to the
blood, so it can be transported around our body, so each cell can
receive its fair share of oxygen, allowing oxygen to serve as the final
electron acceptor during the electron transport chain of cellular
respiration, allowing the cell to produce lots of ATP. And it all starts
with the lungs.

### Diseases of the Respiratory System {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlzZWFzZXMgb2YgdGhlIFJlc3BpcmF0b3J5IFN5c3RlbQ.._35-h7n}

When you have a cold, your nasal passages may become so congested that
it’s hard to breathe through your nose. Many other diseases also affect
the respiratory system, most of them more serious than the common cold.
Some lung diseases, such as lung cancer, can be especially dangerous.
The following list includes just a sample of respiratory system
diseases.

-   **Asthma** is a disease in which the air passages of the lungs
    periodically become too narrow, often with excessive
    mucus production. This causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and
    chest tightness. An asthma attack may be triggered by allergens,
    strenuous exercise, stress, or other factors.

You can learn more about asthma by watching the animation at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S04dci7NTPk](watch?v=S04dci7NTPk) .

-   **Pneumonia** is a disease in which some of the alveoli of the lungs
    fill with fluid so gas exchange cannot occur. Symptoms usually
    include coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia
    may be caused by an infection or injury of the lungs.
-   **Emphysema** is a lung disease in which walls of the alveoli break
    down so less gas can be exchanged in the lungs (see **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTEyLWVtcGh5c2VtYS1BbHZlb2xp) ).
    This causes shortness of breath. The damage to the alveoli is
    usually caused by smoking and is irreversible.

#### Causes of Respiratory Diseases {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._35-zyv}

<span class="c2"> Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens.
</span> <span class="c2"> Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are
pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused
by viruses. </span> <span class="c2">  Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and
acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds,
flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing and
sneezing. </span>

<span class="c2"> Air pollution is another significant cause of
respiratory disease. The quality of the air you breathe can affect the
health of your lungs. Asthma, heart and lung diseases, allergies, and
several types of cancers are all linked to air quality. Air pollution is
not just found outdoors; indoor air pollution can also be responsible
for health problems. </span>

<span class="c2"> Smoking is the most significant cause of respiratory
disease as well as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Exposure to
tobacco smoke by smoking or by breathing air that contains tobacco smoke
is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Regular
smokers die about 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes tobacco use as "the
single most important preventable risk to human health in developed
countries and an important cause of \[early\] death worldwide." </span>

**Specifically, our energy comes from what?**

The respiratory and circulatory systems work together to provide cells
with the oxygen they need for cellular respiration. Cells also need
glucose for cellular respiration. Glucose is a simple sugar that comes
from the food we eat. To get glucose from food, digestion must occur.
This process is carried out by the digestive system.

### Overview of the Digestive System {#14.html#x-ck12-T3ZlcnZpZXcgb2YgdGhlIERpZ2VzdGl2ZSBTeXN0ZW0._36-je3}

The **digestive system** consists of organs that break down food and
absorb nutrients such as glucose. Organs of the digestive system are
shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTEzLWRpZ2VzdGl2ZS1zeXN0ZW0.) . Most of
the organs make up the **gastrointestinal tract** . The rest of the
organs are called **accessory organs** .

The digestive system includes organs from the mouth to the anus.

</div>

#### The Gastrointestinal Tract {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEdhc3Ryb2ludGVzdGluYWwgVHJhY3Q._36-lfb}

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a long tube that connects the mouth
with the anus. It is more than 9 meters (30 feet) long in adults and
includes the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. Food
enters the mouth, passes through the other organs of the GI tract, and
then leaves the body through the anus.

At **The Digestive Process** link below, you can watch an animation that
shows what happens to food as it passes through the GI tract.
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm3oIX6jjn4](watch?v=lm3oIX6jjn4) .

The organs of the GI tract are lined with **mucous membranes** that
secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. The organs are also
covered by layers of muscle that enable peristalsis. **Peristalsis** is
an involuntary muscle contraction that moves rapidly along an organ like
a wave (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE0LVBlcmlzdGFsc2lz) ). You can watch
an animation of peristalsis at this link:

#### Accessory Organs of Digestion {#14.html#x-ck12-QWNjZXNzb3J5IE9yZ2FucyBvZiBEaWdlc3Rpb24._36-wzn}

Other organs involved in digestion include the liver, gall bladder, and
pancreas. They are called accessory organs because food does not pass
through them. Instead, they secrete or store substances needed for
digestion.

#### Functions of the Digestive System {#14.html#x-ck12-RnVuY3Rpb25zIG9mIHRoZSBEaWdlc3RpdmUgU3lzdGVt_36-qyn}

The digestive system has three main functions: digestion of food,
absorption of nutrients, and elimination of solid food waste.
**Digestion** is the process of breaking down food into components the
body can absorb. It consists of two types of processes: mechanical
digestion and chemical digestion.

-   **Mechanical digestion** is the physical breakdown of chunks of food
    into smaller pieces. This type of digestion takes place mainly in
    the mouth and stomach.
-   **Chemical digestion** is the chemical breakdown of large, complex
    food molecules into smaller, simpler nutrient molecules that can be
    absorbed by the blood. This type of digestion begins in the mouth
    and stomach but occurs mainly in the small intestine.

After food is digested, the resulting nutrients are absorbed.
**Absorption** is the process in which substances pass into the
bloodstream, where they can circulate throughout the body. Absorption of
nutrients occurs mainly in the small intestine. Any remaining matter
from food that cannot be digested and absorbed passes into the large
intestine as waste. The waste later passes out of the body through the
anus in the process of **elimination** .

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._36-8im}

-   The digestive system consists of organs that break down food, absorb
    nutrients, and eliminate waste.

**What's the first step in the digestion process?**

It all starts with the mouth. Food goes in, you chew it up, swallow it,
then what happens? The process of turning that food into energy and
proteins and other things necessary for life begins. But it all starts
with the mouth.

### The Start of Digestion: Mouth to Stomach {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFN0YXJ0IG9mIERpZ2VzdGlvbjogTW91dGggdG8gU3RvbWFjaA.._37-80o}

Does the sight or aroma of your favorite food make your mouth water?
When this happens, you are getting ready for digestion.

#### Mouth {#14.html#x-ck12-TW91dGg._37-hvc}

The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters. The sight,
smell, or taste of food stimulates the release of digestive enzymes by
**salivary glands** inside the mouth. The major salivary enzyme is
**amylase** . It begins the **chemical digestion** of carbohydrates by
breaking down starch into sugar.

The mouth also begins the process of **mechanical digestion** . Sharp
teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it
(see **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE1LVRlZXRoLUFMVA..) ).
Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Food is
easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary
glands. The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you
swallow. After you swallow, the chewed food passes into the pharynx.

Teeth are important for mechanical digestion.

</div>

#### Esophagus {#14.html#x-ck12-RXNvcGhhZ3Vz_37-asd}

From the pharynx, the food moves into the esophagus. The **esophagus**
is a long, narrow tube that passes food from the pharynx to the stomach
by peristalsis. The esophagus has no other digestive functions. At the
end of the esophagus, a muscle called a sphincter controls the entrance
to the stomach. The sphincter opens to let food into the stomach and
then closes again to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus.

#### Stomach {#14.html#x-ck12-U3RvbWFjaA.._37-c80}

The **stomach** is a sac-like organ in which food is further digested
both mechanically and chemically. (To see an animation of how the
stomach digests food, go to the link below.) Churning movements of the
stomach’s thick, muscular walls complete the mechanical breakdown of
food. The churning movements also mix food with digestive fluids
secreted by the stomach. One of these fluids is hydrochloric acid. It
kills bacteria in food and gives the stomach the low (acidic) pH needed
by digestive enzymes that work in the stomach. The main enzyme is
**pepsin** , which chemically digests protein.

See [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URHBBE3RKEs](watch?v=URHBBE3RKEs)
for additional information.

The stomach stores the partly digested food until the small intestine is
ready to receive it. When the small intestine is empty, a sphincter
opens to allow the partially digested food to enter the small intestine.

The following interactive animation demonstrates the processes that
occur in the stomach.

**These projections absorb. Absorb what?**

Imagine the inside walls of the 23 feet of your small intestine covered
with these finger-like projections. Why? What's their purpose, and why
is the small intestine so long? These projections absorb. Absorb what?
Minerals and nutrients from food. And the length of the small intestine
allows as much of these important substances to be absorbed as possible.

### Digestion and Absorption: The Small Intestine {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlnZXN0aW9uIGFuZCBBYnNvcnB0aW9uOiBUaGUgU21hbGwgSW50ZXN0aW5l_38-ml7}

The **small intestine** is a narrow tube about 7 meters (23 feet) long
in adults. It is the site of most chemical digestion and virtually all
absorption. The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum,
jejunum and ileum (see the opening figure).

#### Digestion in the Small Intestine {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlnZXN0aW9uIGluIHRoZSBTbWFsbCBJbnRlc3RpbmU._38-idu}

The **duodenum** is the first and shortest part of the small intestine.
Most chemical digestion takes place here, and many digestive enzymes are
active in the duodenum (see **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6ZGlnZXN0aXZlLWVuenltZXM.) ). Some are
produced by the duodenum itself. Others are produced by the pancreas and
secreted into the duodenum.

  Enzyme      What It Digests   Where It Is Made
  ----------- ----------------- --------------------
  Amylase     carbohydrates     pancreas
  Trypsin     proteins          pancreas
  Lipase      lipids            pancreas, duodenum
  Maltase     carbohydrates     duodenum
  Peptidase   proteins          duodenum

The **liver** is an organ of both digestion and excretion. It produces a
fluid called **bile** , which is secreted into the duodenum. Some bile
also goes to the **gall bladder** , a sac-like organ that stores and
concentrates bile and then secretes it into the small intestine. In the
duodenum, bile breaks up large globules of lipids into smaller globules
that are easier for enzymes to break down. Bile also reduces the acidity
of food entering from the highly acidic stomach. This is important
because digestive enzymes that work in the duodenum need a neutral
environment. The pancreas contributes to the neutral environment by
secreting bicarbonate, a basic substance that neutralizes acid.

#### Absorption in the Small Intestine {#14.html#x-ck12-QWJzb3JwdGlvbiBpbiB0aGUgU21hbGwgSW50ZXN0aW5l_38-sid}

The **jejunum** is the second part of the small intestine, where most
nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE2LXZpbGxp) , the mucous membrane
lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike
projections called **villi** (singular, villus). Villi contain many
capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream
through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly
increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner
surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court!

The **ileum** is the third part of the small intestine. A few remaining
nutrients are absorbed here. Like the jejunum, the inner surface of the
ileum is covered with villi that increase the surface area for
absorption.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._38-uwt}

-   Virtually all absorption of nutrients takes place in the small
    intestine, which has a very large inner surface area because it is

**Liquid to solid. What does this mean?**

Well, that's exactly what the large intestine does. It takes the remains
of digested food — that is, food in which all the nutrients and minerals
have been removed, and prepares it for elimination.

### The Large Intestine and Its Functions {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIExhcmdlIEludGVzdGluZSBhbmQgSXRzIEZ1bmN0aW9ucw.._39-7uv}

From the small intestine, any remaining food wastes pass into the large
intestine. The **large intestine** is a relatively wide tube that
connects the small intestine with the anus. Like the small intestine,
the large intestine also consists of three parts: the cecum (or caecum),
colon, and rectum. Follow food as it moves through the digestive system

#### Absorption of Water and Elimination of Wastes {#14.html#x-ck12-QWJzb3JwdGlvbiBvZiBXYXRlciBhbmQgRWxpbWluYXRpb24gb2YgV2FzdGVz_39-mrv}

The **cecum** is the first part of the large intestine, where wastes
enter from the small intestine. The wastes are in a liquid state. As
they pass through the **colon** , which is the second part of the large
intestine, excess water is absorbed. The remaining solid wastes are
called **feces** . Feces accumulate in the **rectum** , which is the
third part of the large intestine. As the rectum fills, the feces become
compacted. After a certain amount of feces accumulate, they are
eliminated from the body. A sphincter controls the anus and opens to let
feces pass through.

#### Bacteria in the Large Intestine {#14.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWEgaW4gdGhlIExhcmdlIEludGVzdGluZQ.._39-eb8}

Trillions of bacteria normally live in the large intestine. Most of them
are helpful. In fact, we wouldn’t be able to survive without them. Some
of the bacteria produce vitamins, which are absorbed by the large
intestine. Other functions of intestinal bacteria include:

-   controlling the growth of harmful bacteria.
-   breaking down indigestible food components.
-   producing substances that help prevent colon cancer.
-   breaking down toxins before they can poison the body.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._39-o29}

-   The absorption of water from digestive wastes and the elimination of
    the remaining solid wastes occur in the large intestine.
-   The large intestine also contains helpful bacteria.

**What's worse than an upset stomach?**

You've probably had an upset stomach. Most likely it was due to
something you ate. But imagine bleeding from your stomach. That's a
little different than your stomach just being upset. Stomach ulcers can
be very serious.

### Diseases of the Digestive System {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlzZWFzZXMgb2YgdGhlIERpZ2VzdGl2ZSBTeXN0ZW0._40-95e}

Many diseases can affect the digestive system. Three of the most common
diseases that affect the digestive system are food allergies, ulcers,
and heartburn. Foodborne illnesses and food intolerance are also serious
issues associated with the digestive system.

-   Food **allergies** occur when the immune system reacts to substances
    in food as though they were harmful “foreign invaders.” Foods that
    are most likely to cause allergies are pictured in **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE3LWFsbGVyZ2llcw..) , and include
    nuts, eggs, grains and milk. Symptoms of food allergies often
    include vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms of food allergies include
    itching and swelling of the lips and mouth. More serious symptoms
    include trouble breathing. In some instances, a food allergy can
    trigger anaphylaxis, which is an extremely severe reaction.
    Emergency medical treatment is critical for this condition, which
    left untreated, can lead to death.

-   **Ulcers** are sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum that
    are usually caused by bacterial infections. They may also be caused
    by the acidic environment of the stomach. Stomach acids may damage
    the lining of the stomach. Symptoms typically include abdominal pain
    and bleeding. You can see how stomach ulcers develop at this link:

-   **Heartburn** is a painful burning sensation in the chest caused by
    stomach acid backing up into the esophagus. The stomach acid may
    eventually cause serious damage to the esophagus unless the problem
    is corrected.

**Are these really good for you?**

Fresh fruit and vegetables. Every child's favorite. Especially those
vegetables. When your mother tells you to "eat your vegetables," there
is a reason for that. Yes, they are actually good for you.

### Food and Nutrients {#14.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBhbmQgTnV0cmllbnRz_41-aom}

Did you ever hear the saying, “You are what you eat”? It’s not just a
saying. It’s actually true. What you eat plays an important role in your
health. Eating a variety of the right types of foods promotes good
health and provides energy for growth and activity. This is because
healthful foods are rich in nutrients. **Nutrients** are substances the
body needs for energy, building materials, and control of body
processes. There are six main classes of nutrients: carbohydrates,
proteins, lipids, water, vitamins, and minerals. These six classes are
categorized as macronutrients or micronutrients depending on how much of
them the body needs.

#### Macronutrients {#14.html#x-ck12-TWFjcm9udXRyaWVudHM._41-toz}

Nutrients the body needs in relatively large amounts are called
**macronutrients** . They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and
water. All macronutrients except water can be used by the body for
energy. (The energy in food is measured in a unit called a **Calorie**
.) The exact amount of each macronutrient that an individual needs
depends on many factors, including gender and age. Recommended daily
intakes by teens of three macronutrients are shown in **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6bWFjcm9udXRyaWVudHM.) . Based on your
gender and age, how many grams of proteins should you eat each day?

  Gender/Age            Carbohydrates (g/day)   Proteins (g/day)   Water (L/day) (includes water in food)
  --------------------- ----------------------- ------------------ ----------------------------------------
  Males 9–13 years      130                     34                 2.4
  Males 14-18 years     130                     52                 3.3
  Females 9-13 years    130                     34                 2.1
  Females 14-18 years   130                     46                 2.3

-   **Carbohydrates** include sugars, starches, and fiber. Sugars and
    starches are used by the body for energy. One gram of carbohydrates
    provides 4 Calories of energy. Fiber, which is found in plant foods,
    cannot be digested but is needed for good health. Simple
    carbohydrates are small carbohydrates found in foods such as fruits
    and milk. These carbohydrates include lactose, fructose and glucose.
    Complex carbohydrates are much larger molecules. Starch, which is a
    complex carbohydrate found in vegetables and grains, is made of
    thousands of glucose units bonded together.
-   Dietary **proteins** are broken down during digestion to provide the
    amino acids needed for protein synthesis. Any extra proteins in the
    diet not needed for this purpose are used for energy or stored
    as fat. One gram of proteins provides 4 Calories of energy. Eating
    protein provides the amino acids for your cells to produce your own
    antibodies, muscle fibers and enzymes (as well as many other types
    of proteins).
-   **Lipids** provide the body with energy and serve other vital
    functions, such as protecting neurons and providing the membranes
    that surround all cells. One gram of lipids provides 9 Calories
    of energy. You need to eat small amounts of lipids for good health.
    However, large amounts can be harmful, especially if they contain
    saturated fatty acids from animal foods. More about saturated and
    unsaturated fats can be found at *Nutrition and Healthy Eating* : 
    [http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550](art-20045550) .
-   Water is essential to life because biochemical reactions take place
    in water. Most people can survive only a few days without water.

#### Micronutrients {#14.html#x-ck12-TWljcm9udXRyaWVudHM._41-psm}

Nutrients the body needs in relatively small amounts are called
**micronutrients** . They include vitamins and minerals. **Vitamins**
are organic compounds that are needed by the body to function properly.
Several vitamins are described in **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dml0YW1pbnM.) . Vitamins play many roles
in good health, ranging from maintaining good vision to helping blood
clot. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria in the large intestine.
Vitamin D is synthesized by the skin when it is exposed to UV light.
Most other vitamins must be obtained from foods like those listed in
**Table** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6dml0YW1pbnM.) .

  Vitamin   Function                   Good Food Sources
  --------- -------------------------- ----------------------
  A         good vision                carrots, spinach
  B12       normal nerve function      meat, milk
  C         making connective tissue   oranges, red peppers
  D         healthy bones and teeth    salmon, eggs
  E         normal cell membranes      vegetable oils, nuts
  K         blood clotting             spinach, soybeans

**Minerals** are chemical elements that are essential for body
processes. They include calcium, which helps form strong bones and
teeth, and potassium, which is needed for normal nerve and muscle
function. Good sources of minerals include leafy, green vegetables,
whole grains, milk, and meats.

Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy, but they are still
essential for good health. The necessary amounts can usually be met with
balanced eating. However, people who do not eat enough of the right
foods may need vitamin or mineral supplements.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._41-tqp}

-   Nutrients are substances that the body needs for energy, building
    materials, and control of body processes.
-   Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water are nutrients needed in
    relatively large amounts.
-   Vitamins and minerals are nutrients needed in much smaller amounts.

**Why is the** ***good*** **stuff in the smallest segment of this
diagram?**

If you're like most high school kids, one of the first things you do
after school is search for something to eat. And you look for the chips
or candy. As this diagram shows, you can eat those. Just not a lot.

### Balanced Eating {#14.html#x-ck12-QmFsYW5jZWQgRWF0aW5n_42-g3k}

**Balanced eating** is a way of eating that promotes good health. It
means eating the right balance of different foods to provide the body
with all the nutrients it needs. Fortunately, you don’t need to measure
and record the amounts of different nutrients you each day in order to
balance your eating. Instead, you can use MyPlate, MyPyramid and food
labels.

#### MyPyramid and MyPlate {#14.html#x-ck12-TXlQeXJhbWlkIGFuZCBNeVBsYXRl_42-jbd}

**MyPyramid** shows the relative amounts of foods in different food
groups you should eat each day (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE4LU15UHlyYW1pZA..) ). You can visit
the MyPyramid Web site at [http://www.mypyramid.gov](www.mypyramid.gov)
to learn more about MyPyramid and customize it for your own gender, age,
and activity level.

**Figure 14.71**

MyPyramid is a visual guideline for balanced eating.

</div>

Each food group represented by a colored band in MyPyramid is a good
source of nutrients. The key in **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE4LU15UHlyYW1pZA..) shows the food
group each band represents. The wider the band, the more you should eat
from that food group. The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods that
should be eaten only once in a while, such as ice cream and potato
chips. They contain few nutrients and may contribute excess Calories to
the diet.

The figure “walking” up the side of MyPyramid represents the role of
physical activity in balanced eating. Regular exercise helps you burn
any extra energy that you consume in foods and provides many other
health benefits. You should be active for about an hour a day most days
of the week. The more active you are, the more energy you will use.

In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My
Pyramid with **MyPlate.** MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of
various food groups. See [http://www.choosemyplate.gov/]() for further
information.

**Figure 14.72**

MyPlate is a visual guideline for balanced eating, replacing MyPyramid
in 2011.

</div>

The following guidelines accompany MyPlate:

1\. Balancing Calories

-   Enjoy your food, but eat less.
-   Avoid oversized portions.

2\. Foods to Increase

-   Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.
-   Make at least half your grains whole grains.
-   Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk.

3\. Foods to Reduce

-   Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals - and
    choose the foods with lower numbers.
-   Drink water instead of sugary drinks.

#### Food Labels {#14.html#x-ck12-Rm9vZCBMYWJlbHM._42-3ik}

Packaged foods are required by law to carry a nutrition facts label,
like the one in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTE5LW51dHJpdGlvbi1mYWN0cy1sYWJlbA..) .
The labels show the nutrient content and ingredients of foods. Reading
labels can help you choose foods that are high in nutrients you need
more of (such as proteins) and low in nutrients you need less of (such
as fats).

**Figure 14.73**

Nutrition facts labels like this one can help you make good food
choices.

</div>

You should also look for ingredients such as whole grains, vegetables,
and fruits. Avoid foods that contain processed ingredients, such as
white flour or white rice. Processing removes nutrients. As a result,
processed foods generally supply fewer nutrients than whole foods, even
when they have been enriched or fortified with added nutrients.

#### Weight Gain and Obesity {#14.html#x-ck12-V2VpZ2h0IEdhaW4gYW5kIE9iZXNpdHk._42-sfj}

Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates,
proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500
Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1
pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food
energy then they need may become obese. **Obesity** occurs when the body
mass index is 30.0 kg/m ^2^ or greater. **Body mass index (BMI)** is an
estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a
person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in
meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2
diabetes and hypertension.

#### Eating Disorders {#14.html#x-ck12-RWF0aW5nIERpc29yZGVycw.._42-frs}

Some people who are obese have an eating disorder, called binge eating
disorder, in which they compulsively overeat. An **eating disorder** is
a mental illness in which people feel compelled to eat in a way that
causes physical, mental, and emotional health problems. Other eating
disorders include anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Treatments for
eating disorders include counseling and medication.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._42-awe}

-   Balanced eating promotes good health.
-   MyPlate, MyPyramid, and food labels are tools that can help you
    choose the right foods for balanced eating.
-   Eating too much and exercising too little can lead to weight gain
    and obesity.
-   Some people who are obese have an eating disorder. Eating disorders
    are mental illnesses that require treatment by health professionals.

**What do you do with your waste?**

Toxic waste must be disposed of properly or there can be serious
consequences. Now, your waste should not be as colorful or toxic as
shown here (if it is, get yourself to a doctor as soon as possible), but
it still needs to be removed from you. And that is the role of the
excretory system. The excretory system gets rid of waste and excess
water.

### Excretion {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhjcmV0aW9u_43-fzm}

If you exercise on a hot day, you are likely to lose a lot of water in
sweat. Then, for the next several hours, you may notice that you do not
pass **urine** as often as normal and that your urine is darker than
usual. Do you know why this happens? Your body is low on water and
trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine. The amount of water
lost in urine is controlled by the **kidneys** , the main organs of the
excretory system.

**Excretion** is the process of removing wastes and excess water from
the body. It is one of the major ways the body maintains homeostasis.
Although the kidneys are the main organs of excretion, several other
organs also excrete wastes. They include the large intestine, liver,
skin, and lungs. All of these organs of excretion, along with the
kidneys, make up the **excretory system** . The roles of the excretory
organs other than the kidney are summarized below:

-   The large intestine eliminates solid wastes that remain after the
    digestion of food.
-   The liver breaks down excess amino acids and toxins in the blood.
-   The skin eliminates excess water and salts in sweat.
-   The lungs exhale water vapor and carbon dioxide.

**How is it determined what's waste and what's not?**

Shown above is a major process of maintaining homeostasis. Getting rid
of waste and excess water. Such a basic process is actually very
complex. It involves an intricate exchange of material through the
kidney.

### Urinary System {#14.html#x-ck12-VXJpbmFyeSBTeXN0ZW0._44-sok}

The **kidneys** are part of the **urinary system** , which is shown in
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTIwLVVyaW5hcnktU3lzdGVt) .
The main function of the urinary system is to filter waste products and
excess water from the blood and excrete them from the body.

#### Filtering Blood and Forming Urine {#14.html#x-ck12-RmlsdGVyaW5nIEJsb29kIGFuZCBGb3JtaW5nIFVyaW5l_44-biq}

As shown in **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTIyLW5lcGhyb24.)
, each nephron acts as a tiny filtering plant. It filters blood and
forms urine in the following steps:

1.  Blood enters the kidney through the **renal artery** , which
    branches into capillaries. When blood passes through capillaries of
    the **glomerulus** of a nephron, blood pressure forces some of the
    water and dissolved substances in the blood to cross the capillary
    walls into **Bowman’s capsule** .
2.  The filtered substances pass to the **renal tubule** of the nephron.
    In the renal tubule, some of the filtered substances are reabsorbed
    and returned to the bloodstream. Other substances are secreted into
    the fluid.
3.  The fluid passes to a collecting duct, which reabsorbs some of the
    water and returns it to the bloodstream. The fluid that remains in
    the collecting duct is urine.

</div>

#### Excretion of Urine {#14.html#x-ck12-RXhjcmV0aW9uIG9mIFVyaW5l_44-sdc}

From the collecting ducts of the kidneys, urine enters the **ureters** ,
two muscular tubes that move the urine by peristalsis to the bladder
(see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTIwLVVyaW5hcnktU3lzdGVt) ). The
**bladder** is a hollow, sac-like organ that stores urine. When the
bladder is about half full, it sends a nerve impulse to a sphincter to
relax and let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The
**urethra** is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body. Urine
leaves the body through another sphincter in the process of
**urination** . This sphincter and the process of urination are normally
under conscious control.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._44-srt}

-   The kidneys filter blood and form urine. They are part of the

**Why is a bean-shaped organ so important?**

Shown above are the isolated kidneys from many little mice. OK, they're
really just kidney beans. But this is what the important kidney looks
like. Why is it so important? Your kidneys filter and remove wastes from
your blood.

### The Kidneys {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIEtpZG5leXM._45-ng3}

The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs just above the waist. They
are important organs with many functions in the body, including
producing hormones, absorbing minerals, and filtering blood and
producing urine.

A cross-section of a kidney is shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTIxLUtpZG5leQ..) . The function of the
kidney is to filter blood and form urine. **Urine** is the liquid waste
product of the body that is excreted by the urinary system. Wastes in
the blood come from the normal breakdown of tissues, such as muscles,
and from food. The body uses food for energy. After the body has taken
the nutrients it needs from food, some of the wastes are absorbed into
the blood. If the kidneys did not remove them, these wastes would build
up in the blood and damage the body.

#### Kidneys and Nephrons {#14.html#x-ck12-S2lkbmV5cyBhbmQgTmVwaHJvbnM._45-ank}

The actual removal of wastes from the blood occurs in tiny units inside
the kidneys called nephrons. **Nephrons** are the structural and
functional units of the kidneys. A single kidney may have more than a
million nephrons! This is further discussed in the *Urinary System*
concept.

</div>

#### Kidneys and Homeostasis {#14.html#x-ck12-S2lkbmV5cyBhbmQgSG9tZW9zdGFzaXM._45-saq}

The kidneys play many vital roles in **homeostasis** . They work with
many other organ systems to do this. For example, they work with the
circulatory system to filter blood, and with the urinary system to
remove wastes.

The kidneys filter all the blood in the body many times each day and
produce a total of about 1.5 liters of **urine** . The kidneys control
the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by
excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete
**hormones** that help maintain homeostasis. **Erythropoietin** , for
example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red
blood cells when more are needed. They also secrete renin, which
regulates blood pressure, and calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D,
which helps maintain calcium for bones. The kidneys themselves are also
regulated by hormones. For example, **antidiuretic hormone** from the
hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine
when the body is low on water.

#### Other Functions {#14.html#x-ck12-T3RoZXIgRnVuY3Rpb25z_45-a4p}

In addition to filtering blood and producing urine, the kidneys are also
involved in maintaining the water level in the body, and regulating red
blood cell levels and blood pressure.

-   As the kidneys are mainly involved in the production of urine, they
    react to changes in the body’s water level throughout the day. As
    water intake decreases, the kidneys adjust accordingly and leave
    water in the body instead of helping remove it through the urine,
    maintaining the water level in the body.
-   The kidneys also need constant pressure to filter the blood. When
    the blood pressure drops too low, the kidneys increase the pressure.
    One way is by producing angiotensin, a blood
    vessel-constricting protein. This protein also signals the body to
    retain sodium and water. Together, the constriction of blood vessels
    and retention of sodium and water help restore normal
    blood pressure.
-   When the kidneys don’t get enough oxygen, they send out a signal in
    the form of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone
    marrow to produce more oxygen-carrying red blood cells.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._45-fdb}

-   The kidneys maintain homeostasis by controlling the amount of water,
    ions, and other substances in the blood.
-   Kidneys also secrete hormones that have other homeostatic functions.

**How do you block the flow of urine?**

Kidney stones. Imagine having that travel through your excretory system.
OK, that's not a kidney stone, but you get the idea. Kidney stones can
be more than a few millimeters in diameter. Painful? Sometimes extremely
uncomfortable. And how does a stone leave the kidney? The same way urine
does.

### Kidney Disease and Dialysis {#14.html#x-ck12-S2lkbmV5IERpc2Vhc2UgYW5kIERpYWx5c2lz_46-jvf}

A person can live a normal, healthy life with just one kidney. However,
at least one kidney must function properly to maintain life. Diseases
that threaten the health and functioning of the kidneys include kidney
stones, infections, and diabetes.

-   **Kidney stones** are mineral crystals that form in urine inside
    the kidney. Kidney stones can form when substances in the urine,
    such as calcium, oxalate, and phosphorus, become
    highly concentrated. They may be extremely painful. If they block a
    ureter, they must be removed so urine can leave the kidney and
    be excreted. A kidney stone may not cause symptoms until it moves
    around within your kidney or passes into your ureter. A stone may
    stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract. Kidney stones
    vary in size. A small stone may pass on its own, causing little or
    no pain. A larger stone may get stuck along the urinary tract and
    can block the flow of urine, causing severe pain or bleeding.
-   Bacterial infections of the urinary tract, especially the bladder,
    are very common. Bladder infections can be treated with antibiotics
    prescribed by a doctor. If untreated, they may lead to
    kidney damage.
-   Uncontrolled **diabetes** may damage capillaries of nephrons. As a
    result, the kidneys lose much of their ability to filter blood. This
    is called **kidney failure** . The only cure for kidney failure is a
    kidney transplant, but it can be treated with dialysis. **Dialysis**
    is a medical procedure in which blood is filtered through a machine
    (see **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTIzLTIzLWRpYWx5c2lz) ).

**How does your body keep most enemies out?**

Many would consider the moat around this castle, together with the thick
stone castle walls, as the first line of defense. Their role is to keep
the enemy out, and protect what's inside.

**Figure 14.79**

</div>

Does this organism look like a space alien? A scary creature from a
nightmare? In fact, it’s a 1-cm long worm that lives in the human body
and causes serious harm. It enters the body through a hair follicle of
the skin when it’s in a much smaller stage of its life cycle. Like this
worm, many other organisms can make us sick if they manage to enter our
body. Fortunately for us, our immune system is able to keep out most
such invaders.

The **immune system** protects the body from worms, germs, and other
agents of harm. The immune system is like a medieval castle. The outside
of the castle was protected by a moat and high stone walls. Inside the
castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any invaders that managed to
get through the outer defenses. Like a medieval castle, the immune
system has a series of defenses. In fact, it has three lines of defense.
Only pathogens that are able to get through all three lines of defense
can harm the body.

The body’s first line of defense consists of different types of barriers
that keep most pathogens out of the body. **Pathogens** are
disease-causing agents, such as bacteria and viruses. These and other
types of pathogens are described in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTAxLVRhYmxlLWZvdXItcGF0aG9nZW5z) .
Regardless of the type of pathogen, however, the first line of defense
is always the same.

#### Mechanical Barriers {#14.html#x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBCYXJyaWVycw.._47-457}

**Mechanical barriers** physically block pathogens from entering the
body. The skin is the most important mechanical barrier. In fact, it is
the single most important defense the body has. The outer layer of the
skin is tough and very difficult for pathogens to penetrate.

**Mucous membranes** provide a mechanical barrier at body openings. They
also line the respiratory, GI, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Mucous
membranes secrete **mucus** , a slimy substance that traps pathogens.
The membranes also have hair-like cilia. The **cilia** sweep mucus and
pathogens toward body openings where they can be removed from the body.
When you sneeze or cough, pathogens are removed from the nose and throat
(see **Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTAyLVNuZWV6ZQ..) ).
Tears wash pathogens from the eyes, and urine flushes pathogens out of
the urinary tract. You can watch the sweeping action of cilia at the
following link:

**Figure 14.81**

A sneeze can expel many pathogens from the respiratory tract. That’s why
you should always cover your mouth and nose and when you sneeze.

</div>

#### Chemical Barriers {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgQmFycmllcnM._47-lnw}

**Chemical barriers** destroy pathogens on the outer body surface, at
body openings, and on inner body linings. Sweat, mucus, tears, and
saliva all contain enzymes that kill pathogens. Urine is too acidic for
many pathogens, and semen contains zinc, which most pathogens cannot
tolerate. In addition, stomach acid kills pathogens that enter the GI
tract in food or water.

#### Biological Barriers {#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvbG9naWNhbCBCYXJyaWVycw.._47-zeq}

**Biological barriers** are living organisms that help protect the body.
Millions of harmless bacteria live on the human skin. Many more live in
the GI tract. The harmless bacteria use up food and space so harmful
bacteria cannot grow.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._47-0i7}

**What happens when an enemy gets past the first line of defense?**

For this running back to make it past the first line of defense, there
usually has to be a hole or break in the line. He then runs into the
secondary, or the second line of defense. Whenever the skin is broken,
it is possible for pathogens to easily enter your body. They get past
the first line of defense, and run into the second line of defense.

### The Second Line of Defense {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIFNlY29uZCBMaW5lIG9mIERlZmVuc2U._48-q9w}

If you have a cut on your hand, the break in the skin provides a way for
pathogens to enter your body. Assume bacteria enter through the cut and
infect the wound. These bacteria would then encounter the body’s second
line of defense.

#### Inflammatory Response {#14.html#x-ck12-SW5mbGFtbWF0b3J5IFJlc3BvbnNl_48-uhx}

The cut on your hand may become red, warm, and swollen. These are signs
of an **inflammatory response.** This is the first reaction of the body
to tissue damage or infection. As explained in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTAzLUluZmxhbW1hdGlvbg..) , the response
is triggered by chemicals called **cytokines** and **histamines** ,
which are released when tissue is injured or infected. The chemicals
communicate with other cells and coordinate the inflammatory response.
You can see an animation of the inflammatory response at this link:

#### Leukocytes {#14.html#x-ck12-TGV1a29jeXRlcw.._48-dzk}

The chemicals that trigger an inflammatory response attract leukocytes
to the site of injury or infection. **Leukocytes** are white blood
cells. Their role is to fight infections and get rid of debris.
Leukocytes may respond with either a nonspecific or a specific defense.

-   A **nonspecific defense** is the same no matter what type of
    pathogen is involved. An example of a nonspecific defense is
    **phagocytosis.** This is the process in which leukocytes engulf and
    break down pathogens and debris. It is illustrated in **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA0LVdCQw..) . The immune system's
    first line of defense is also a nonspecific defense.
-   A **specific defense** is tailored to a particular pathogen.
    Leukocytes involved in this type of defense are part of the immune
    response and are described in other concepts.

**What happens when your tonsils cause more problems than they solve?**

Almost all of us have had a sore throat at some time. Maybe you had your
tonsils out when you were younger? Why? Your tonsils are two lumps of
tissue that work as germ fighters for your body. But sometimes germs
like to hang out there, where they cause infections. In other words,
your tonsils can cause more problems than they solve. So, you have them
taken out.

### Lymphatic System {#14.html#x-ck12-THltcGhhdGljIFN5c3RlbQ.._49-dvf}

Like the immune systems of other vertebrates, the human immune system is
adaptive. If pathogens manage to get through the body’s first two lines
of defense, the third line of defense takes over. The third line of
defense is referred to as the **immune response** . This defense is
specific to a particular pathogen, and it allows the immune system to
“remember” the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen
tries to invade the body again, the immune response against that
pathogen will be much faster and stronger.

You can watch an overview of the immune response at this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7rQuFZxVQQ](watch?v=G7rQuFZxVQQ) .

The immune response mainly involves the lymphatic system. The
**lymphatic system** is a major part of the immune system. It produces
leukocytes called lymphocytes. **Lymphocytes** are the key cells
involved in the immune response. They recognize and help destroy
particular pathogens in body fluids and cells. They also destroy certain
cancer cells.

#### Structures of the Lymphatic System {#14.html#x-ck12-U3RydWN0dXJlcyBvZiB0aGUgTHltcGhhdGljIFN5c3RlbQ.._49-vqd}

**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA1LUx5bXBoYXRpYy1TeXN0ZW0.)
shows the structures of the lymphatic system. They include organs, lymph
vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes. Organs of the lymphatic system are the
bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and tonsils.

-   **Bone marrow** is found inside many bones. It produces lymphocytes.
-   The **thymus** is located in the upper chest behind the breast bone.
    It stores and matures lymphocytes.
-   The **spleen** is in the upper abdomen. It filters pathogens and
    worn out red blood cells from the blood, and then lymphocytes in the
    spleen destroy them.
-   The **tonsils** are located on either side of the pharynx in
    the throat. They trap pathogens, which are destroyed by lymphocytes
    in the tonsils.

![Components of the lymphatic
system](ck12_14_files/20150914105702524880.png "Components of the lymphatic system")

**Figure 14.84**

The lymphatic system consists of organs, vessels, and lymph.

</div>

#### Lymphatic Vessels and Lymph {#14.html#x-ck12-THltcGhhdGljIFZlc3NlbHMgYW5kIEx5bXBo_49-kfm}

Lymphatic vessels make up a body-wide circulatory system. The fluid they
circulate is lymph. **Lymph** is a fluid that leaks out of capillaries
into spaces between cells. As the lymph accumulates between cells, it
diffuses into tiny lymphatic vessels. The lymph then moves through the
lymphatic system from smaller to larger vessels. It finally drains back
into the bloodstream in the chest. As lymph passes through the lymphatic
vessels, pathogens are filtered out at small structures called **lymph
nodes** (see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA1LUx5bXBoYXRpYy1TeXN0ZW0.) ). The
filtered pathogens are destroyed by lymphocytes.

#### Lymphocytes {#14.html#x-ck12-THltcGhvY3l0ZXM._49-w86}

The human body has as many as two trillion lymphocytes, and lymphocytes
make up about 25% of all leukocytes. The majority of lymphocytes are
found in the lymphatic system, where they are most likely to encounter
pathogens. The rest are found in the blood. There are two major types of
lymphocytes, called **B cells** and **T cells.** These cells get their
names from the organs in which they mature. B cells mature in bone
marrow, and T cells mature in the thymus. Both B and T cells recognize
and respond to particular pathogens.

#### Antigen Recognition {#14.html#x-ck12-QW50aWdlbiBSZWNvZ25pdGlvbg.._49-rdj}

B cells and T cells actually recognize and respond to antigens on
pathogens. **Antigens** are molecules that the immune system recognizes
as foreign to the body. Antigens are also found on cancer cells and the
cells of transplanted organs. They trigger the immune system to react
against the cells that carry them. This is why a transplanted organ may
be rejected by the recipient’s immune system.

How do B and T cells recognize specific antigens? They have receptor
molecules on their surface that bind only with particular antigens.

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA2LWFudGlnZW4tbWF0Y2hpbmc.) , the fit
between an antigen and a matching receptor molecule is like a key in a
lock.

**What are those Y-shaped things floating around the cell?**

They are antibodies, which are large proteins. And they signal specific
antigens for destruction. It does help that the antigens are usually
attached to pathogens.

### Humoral Immune Response {#14.html#x-ck12-SHVtb3JhbCBJbW11bmUgUmVzcG9uc2U._50-p9e}

There are actually two types of immune responses: humoral and
cell-mediated. The **humoral immune response** involves mainly **B
cells** and takes place in blood and lymph. You can watch an animation
of the humoral immune response at this link:
[http://www.cancerresearch.org/resources.aspx?id=586](resources.aspx?id=586)
.

#### B Cell Activation {#14.html#x-ck12-QiBDZWxsIEFjdGl2YXRpb24._50-6tn}

B cells must be activated by an antigen before they can fight pathogens.
This happens in the sequence of events shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA3LUItY2VsbC1hY3RpdmF0aW9u) . First, a
B cell encounters its matching antigen and engulfs it. The B cell then
displays fragments of the antigen on its surface. This attracts a
**helper T cell** . The helper T cell binds to the B cell at the antigen
site and releases **cytokines** that “tell” or signal the B cell to
develop into a **plasma cell** .

B lymphocytes are further discussed at

#### Plasma Cells and Antibody Production {#14.html#x-ck12-UGxhc21hIENlbGxzIGFuZCBBbnRpYm9keSBQcm9kdWN0aW9u_50-xmi}

Plasma cells are activated B cells that secrete antibodies.
**Antibodies** are large, Y-shaped proteins that recognize and bind to
antigens. Plasma cells are like antibody factories, producing many
copies of a single type of antibody. The antibodies travel throughout
the body in blood and lymph. Each antibody binds to just one kind of
antigen. When it does, it forms an **antigen-antibody complex** (see
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA4LWFudGlnZW4tYW50aWJvZHk.)
). The complex flags the antigen-bearing cell for destruction by
**phagocytosis** .

The video at the link below shows how this happens.

</div>

#### Memory Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-TWVtb3J5IENlbGxz_50-dbz}

Most plasma cells live for just a few days, but some of them live much
longer. They may even survive for the lifetime of the individual.
Long-living plasma cells are called **memory cells.** They retain a
“memory” of a specific pathogen long after an infection is over. They
help launch a rapid response against the pathogen if it invades the body
again in the future.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._50-2dq}

-   Activated B cells produce antibodies to a particular antigen.
-   Memory B cells remain in the body after the immune response is over
    and provide immunity to pathogens bearing the antigen.

**Do cells really attack other cells?**

They sure do. Depicted here is a group of T cells attacking a cancer
cell. When they can, the T cells search out and destroy “bad” cells.

### Cell-Mediated Immune Response {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2VsbC1NZWRpYXRlZCBJbW11bmUgUmVzcG9uc2U._51-rfo}

In addition to the humoral response, the other type of immune response
is the **cell-mediated immune response** , which involves mainly **T
cells** . It leads to the destruction of cells that are infected with
viruses. Some cancer cells are also destroyed in this way. There are
several different types of T cells involved in a cell-mediated immune
response, including helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells. You can
watch an animation of this type of immune response at this link:
[http://www.cancerresearch.org/Resources.aspx?id=588](Resources.aspx?id=588)
.

#### T Cell Activation {#14.html#x-ck12-VCBDZWxsIEFjdGl2YXRpb24._51-atk}

All three types of T cells must be activated by an antigen before they
can fight an infection or cancer. T cell activation is illustrated in
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTA5LVQtY2VsbC1hY3RpdmF0aW9u)
. It begins when a B cell or nonspecific leukocyte engulfs a virus and
displays its antigens. When the T cell encounters the matching antigen
on a leukocyte, it becomes activated. What happens next depends on which
type of T cell it is.

**Figure 14.88**

T cell activation requires another leukocyte to engulf a virus and
display its antigen.

</div>

#### Helper T Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-SGVscGVyIFQgQ2VsbHM._51-kgs}

**Helper T cells** are like the “managers” of the immune response. They
secrete **cytokines** , which activate or control the activities of
other lymphocytes. Most helper T cells die out once a pathogen has been
cleared from the body, but a few remain as **memory cells** . These
memory cells are ready to produce large numbers of antigen-specific
helper T cells like themselves if they are exposed to the same antigen
in the future.

Helper T cells are discussed at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwMYpTYsNZM](watch?v=uwMYpTYsNZM) .

#### Cytotoxic T Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-Q3l0b3RveGljIFQgQ2VsbHM._51-e7s}

**Cytotoxic T cells** destroy virus-infected cells and some cancer
cells. Once activated, a cytotoxic T cell divides rapidly and produces
an “army” of cells identical to itself. These cells travel throughout
the body “searching” for more cells to destroy. **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTEwLWN5dG90b3hpYy1ULWNlbGw.) shows how
a cytotoxic T cell destroys a body cell infected with viruses. This T
cell releases toxins that form pores in the membrane of the infected
cell. This causes the cell to burst, destroying both the cell and the
viruses inside it.

You can watch an animation of the actions of cytotoxic T cells at this
link: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8buaiYBKl7U](watch?v=8buaiYBKl7U)

**Figure 14.89**

A cytotoxic T cell releases toxins that destroy an infected body cell
and the viruses it contains.

</div>

After an infection has been brought under control, most cytotoxic T
cells die off. However, a few remain as memory cells. If the same
pathogen enters the body again, the memory cells mount a rapid immune
response. They quickly produce many copies of cytotoxic T cells specific
to the antigen of that pathogen.

#### Regulatory T Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-UmVndWxhdG9yeSBUIENlbGxz_51-gqi}

**Regulatory T cells** are responsible for ending the cell-mediated
immune response after an infection has been curbed. They also suppress T
cells that mistakenly react against self antigens. What might happen if
these T cells were not suppressed?

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._51-ynv}

-   Activated T cells destroy certain cancer cells and cells infected
    by viruses.
-   Memory T cells remain in the body after the immune response and
    provide antigen-specific immunity to the virus.

**Is giving shots to young children a good thing?**

Many, if not most, children hated going to the doctor, as it often meant
getting a shot. Why? The shot actually contained a weakened or dead
pathogen. And putting some of that dead pathogen into you was a good
thing.

### Immunity {#14.html#x-ck12-SW1tdW5pdHk._52-q2k}

Memory B and T cells help protect the body from re-infection by
pathogens that infected the body in the past. Being able to resist a
pathogen in this way is called **immunity.** Immunity can be active or
passive.

#### Active Immunity {#14.html#x-ck12-QWN0aXZlIEltbXVuaXR5_52-zwx}

**Active immunity** results when an immune response to a pathogen
produces memory cells. As long as the memory cells survive, the pathogen
will be unable to cause a serious infection in the body. Some memory
cells last for a lifetime and confer permanent immunity.

Active immunity can also result from immunization. **Immunization** is
the deliberate exposure of a person to a **pathogen** in order to
provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to
that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a
pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is
typically used. This causes an immune response without making the
immunized person sick. This is how you most likely became immune to
measles, mumps, and chicken pox. You can watch an animation showing how
immunization brings about immunity at this link:
[http://www.biosolutions.info/2009/05/vaccination.html](vaccination.html)
.

#### Passive Immunity {#14.html#x-ck12-UGFzc2l2ZSBJbW11bml0eQ.._52-m2e}

**Passive immunity** results when **antibodies** are transferred to a
person who has never been exposed to the pathogen. Passive immunity
lasts only as long as the antibodies survive in body fluids. This is
usually between a few days and a few months. Passive immunity may be
acquired by a fetus through its mother’s blood. It may also be acquired
by an infant though the mother’s breast milk. Older children and adults
can acquire passive immunity through the injection of antibodies.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._52-th7}

-   Immunity is the ability to resist infection by a pathogen.
-   Active immunity results from an immune response to a pathogen and
    the formation of memory cells.
-   Passive immunity results from the transfer of antibodies to a person
    who has not been exposed to the pathogen.

**Have you ever started to sneeze and not known why?**

A beautiful sea of flowers. A nice sight, unless you have an allergic
reaction. It is not uncommon to have reactions to pollen.

### Allergies {#14.html#x-ck12-QWxsZXJnaWVz_53-2ch}

Your immune system usually protects you from pathogens and keeps you
well. However, like any other body system, the immune system itself can
develop problems. Sometimes it responds to harmless foreign substances
as though they were pathogens. Sometimes it attacks the body’s own
cells. Certain diseases can also attack and damage the immune system and
interfere with its ability to defend the body.

An **allergy** is a disease in which the immune system makes an
inflammatory response to a harmless **antigen** . Any antigen that
causes an allergy is called an **allergen.** Allergens may be inhaled or
ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes
of allergies are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTExLXBsYW50LWFsbGVyZ2llcw..) . Inhaling
ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils
in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies
include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and
certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as
pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy,
watery eyes.

Ragweed and poison ivy are common causes of allergies. Are you allergic
to these plants?

</div>

The symptoms of allergies can range from mild to severe. Mild allergy
symptoms are often treated with **antihistamines** . These are drugs
that reduce or eliminate the effects of the histamines that cause
allergy symptoms. Recall that histamines trigger the inflammatory
response. The most severe allergic reaction is called **anaphylaxis** .
This is a life-threatening response caused by a massive release of
histamines. It requires emergency medical treatment.

You can watch an animated video about how allergic reactions occur and
how antihistamines can control them at this link:

Joint pain. Not an uncommon problem as you grow older. Is it due to
normal wear and tear on the joints? Possibly. But rheumatoid arthritis
is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system
mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.

### Autoimmune Diseases {#14.html#x-ck12-QXV0b2ltbXVuZSBEaXNlYXNlcw.._54-phk}

**Autoimmune diseases** occur when the immune system fails to recognize
the body’s own molecules as “self,” or belonging to the person. Instead,
it attacks body cells as though they were dangerous pathogens. There are
more than 80 known autoimmune diseases. Recall that regulatory T cells
help regulate the immune system. When autoimmune disorders occur, these
regulatory T cells fail in their function. This results in damage to
various organs and tissues. The type of autoimmune disorder depends on
the type of body tissue that is affected.

Some relatively common autoimmune diseases are listed in **Table**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-dGFibGU6YXV0b2ltbXVuZS1kaXNlYXNlcw..) . These
diseases cannot be cured, although they can be treated to relieve
symptoms and prevent some of the long-term damage they cause.

  Name of Disease                Tissues Attacked by Immune System                  Results of Immune System Attack
  ------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Rheumatoid arthritis           tissues inside joints                              joint damage and pain
  Type 1 diabetes                insulin-producing cells of the pancreas            inability to produce insulin, high blood sugar
  Multiple sclerosis             myelin sheaths of central nervous system neurons   muscle weakness, pain, fatigue
  Systemic lupus erythematosus   joints, heart, other organs                        joint and organ damage and pain

Why does the immune system attack body cells? In some cases, it’s
because of exposure to **pathogens** that have **antigens** similar to
the body’s own molecules. When this happens, the immune system not only
attacks the pathogens, it also attacks body cells with the similar
molecules.

**Which is stronger?**

You or little tiny pathogens? Usually you are. Normally your body can
put up a strong defense against enemy pathogens. But what if it can't?
What happens if your immune system is "sick"?

### Immunodeficiency {#14.html#x-ck12-SW1tdW5vZGVmaWNpZW5jeQ.._55-nze}

**Immunodeficiency** occurs when the immune system is not working
properly. As a result, it cannot fight off pathogens that a normal
immune system would be able to resist. Most commonly, immunodeficiency
diseases occur when T or B cells (or both) do not work as well as they
should, or when your body doesn't produce enough antibodies.

Rarely, the problem is caused by a defective gene. Inherited
immunodeficiency disorders that affect B cells include
hypogammaglobulinemia, which usually leads to respiratory and
gastrointestinal infections, and agammaglobulinemia, which results in
severe infections early in life, and is often deadly.

More often, immunodeficiency is acquired during a person’s lifetime.
Immunodeficiency may occur for a variety of reasons:

-   The immune system naturally becomes less effective as people
    get older. This is why older people are generally more susceptible
    to disease.
-   The immune system may be damaged by other disorders, such as obesity
    or drug abuse.
-   Certain medications can suppress the immune system. This is an
    intended effect of drugs given to people with transplanted organs.
    In many cases, however, it is an unwanted side effect of drugs used
    to treat other diseases.
-   Some pathogens attack and destroy cells of the immune system. An
    example is the virus known as **HIV** . It is the most common cause
    of immunodeficiency in the world today.

Years ago, a diagnosis of an HIV infection was a death sentence. Not
today. With the proper medical treatment, an individual can live well
over 10 or 20 or more productive years with an AIDS diagnosis. One of
the most famous individuals with HIV is Earvin “Magic” Johnson, a
retired professional basketball player. He was diagnosed in 1991. Over
20 years later, he is still doing well.

### HIV and AIDS {#14.html#x-ck12-SElWIGFuZCBBSURT_56-5mz}

**Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)** is a virus that attacks the
**immune system** . An example of HIV is shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTEyLUhJVg..) . Many people infected
with HIV eventually develop **acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).** This may not occur until many years after the virus first
enters the body.

HIV is a virus that attacks cells of the immune system.

#### HIV Transmission {#14.html#x-ck12-SElWIFRyYW5zbWlzc2lvbg.._56-eqa}

HIV is transmitted, or spread, through direct contact of **mucous
membranes** or body fluids such as blood, semen, or breast milk. As
shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTEzLUhJVi10cmFuc21pc3Npb24.) ,
transmission of the virus can occur through sexual contact or the use of
contaminated hypodermic needles. It can also be transmitted through an
infected mother’s blood to her baby during late pregnancy or birth or
through breast milk after birth. In the past, HIV was also transmitted
through blood transfusions. Because donated blood is now screened for
HIV, the virus is no longer transmitted this way. HIV is not spread
through saliva, touching or in swimming pools.

#### HIV and the Immune System {#14.html#x-ck12-SElWIGFuZCB0aGUgSW1tdW5lIFN5c3RlbQ.._56-byc}

HIV infects and destroys **helper T cells** . As shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTE0LUhJVi1pbmZlY3Rpb24.) , the virus
injects its own DNA into a helper T cell and uses the T cell’s
“machinery” to make copies of itself. In the process the T cell is
destroyed, and the virus copies go on to infect other helper T cells.

You can watch an animation showing how HIV infects T cells at this link:

![HIV mechanism for destroying T
cells](ck12_14_files/20150914105706494715.jpeg "HIV mechanism for destroying T cells")

**Figure 14.93**

This diagram shows how HIV infects and destroys T cells.

</div>

HIV is able to evade the immune system and keep destroying T cells. This
occurs in two ways:

-   The virus frequently mutates and changes its surface **antigens** .
    This prevents antigen-specific lymphocytes from developing that
    could destroy cells infected with the virus.
-   The virus uses the plasma membranes of host cells to hide its
    own antigens. This prevents the host’s immune system from detecting
    the antigens and destroying infected cells.

As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the
number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTE1LUhJVi1hbmQtVC1jZWxscw..) shows how
the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years
following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases,
so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a
result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines
can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at
present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize
people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.

It typically takes several years after infection with HIV for the drop
in T cells to cripple the immune system. What do you think explains the
brief spike in T cells that occurs early in the HIV infection shown

</div>

#### AIDS {#14.html#x-ck12-QUlEUw.._56-3bv}

AIDS is not a single disease but a set of diseases. It results from
years of damage to the immune system by HIV. It occurs when helper T
cells fall to a very low level and opportunistic diseases occur (see
**Figure** [above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTE1LUhJVi1hbmQtVC1jZWxscw..)
). **Opportunistic diseases** are infections and tumors that are rare
except in people with immunodeficiency. The diseases take advantage of
the opportunity presented by people whose immune systems can’t fight
back. Opportunistic diseases are usually the direct cause of death of
people with AIDS.

AIDS and HIV were first identified in 1981. Scientists think that the
virus originally infected monkeys but then jumped to human populations,
probably sometime during the early to mid-1900s. This most likely
occurred in West Africa, but the virus soon spread around the world (see
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI0LTE2LUhJVi1tYXA.) ). Since
then, HIV has killed more than 25 million people worldwide. The hardest
hit countries are in Africa, where medicines to slow down the virus are
least available. The worldwide economic toll of HIV and AIDS has also
been enormous.

#### HIV Research: Beyond the Vaccine {#14.html#x-ck12-SElWIFJlc2VhcmNoOiBCZXlvbmQgdGhlIFZhY2NpbmU._56-oju}

Over the past 15 years, the number of people who die of AIDS each year
in the United States has dropped by 70 percent. But AIDS remains a
serious public health crisis among low-income African-Americans,
particularly women. And in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus killed more
than 1.6 million people in 2007 alone. Innovative research approaches
could lead to new treatments and possibly a cure for AIDS. HIV/AIDS has
been described as a disease of poverty. Individuals with poor access to
health care are less likely to see a doctor early on in their HIV
infection, and thus they may be more likely to transmit the infection.
HIV is now the leading cause of death for African American women between
24 and 35 years old.

For patients who have access to drugs, infection with the virus has
ceased to be a death sentence. In 1995, combinations of drugs called
**highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)** were developed. For
some patients, drugs can reduce the amount of virus to undetectable
levels. But some amount of virus always hides in the body's immune cells
and attacks again if the patient stops taking his or her medication.
Researchers are working on developing a drug to wipe out this hidden
virus, which could mean the end of AIDS. See
[http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/hiv-research-beyond-the-vaccine](hiv-research-beyond-the-vaccine)
for further information.

**Would you believe the male reproductive structures are over 100 feet
long?**

The male reproductive system has two goals: to produce and deliver sperm
and to secrete testosterone. Might seem simple. But there are a number
of complicated processes and structures - including over 100 feet of
tubules - that go into these simple goals.

The male reproductive system has two main functions: (1) to produce
sperm, the male gamete, and (2) to release the male sex hormone,
testosterone, into the body.

### Male Reproductive Structures {#14.html#x-ck12-TWFsZSBSZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUgU3RydWN0dXJlcw.._57-mzw}

The reproductive system in both males and females consists of structures
that produce reproductive cells, or gametes, and secrete sex hormones. A
gamete is a haploid cell that combines with another haploid gamete
during fertilization. Recall that haploid cells have one complete set of
chromosomes; in humans that would be 22 autosomes and one sex
chromosome.

Sex hormones are chemical messengers that control sexual development and
reproduction. The male reproductive system consists of structures that
produce male gametes called sperm and secrete the male sex hormone
testosterone.

The main structures of the male **reproductive system** are shown in
**Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTAxLU1hbGUtcmVwcm9kdWN0aXZlLXBhcnRz) .

**Figure 14.96**

Male Reproductive Structures. Organs of the male reproductive system
include the penis, testes, and epididymis. Several ducts and glands are
also part of the system. Do you know the reproductive functions of any
of these structures?

</div>

#### Penis {#14.html#x-ck12-UGVuaXM._57-yjd}

The **penis** is an external genital organ with a long shaft and
enlarged tip called the glans penis. The shaft of the penis contains
erectile tissues that can fill with blood and cause an erection. When
this occurs, the penis gets bigger and stiffer. The **urethra** passes
through the penis. **Sperm** pass out of the body through the urethra.
(During urination, the urethra carries urine from the bladder.)

#### Testes {#14.html#x-ck12-VGVzdGVz_57-pzj}

The two **testes** (singular, testis) are located below the penis. They
hang between the thighs in a sac of skin called the **scrotum** . Each
testis contains more than 30 meters (over 90 feet) of tiny, tightly
packed tubules called **seminiferous tubules** . These tubules are the
functional units of the testes. They produce sperm and secrete
**testosterone** .

#### Epididymis {#14.html#x-ck12-RXBpZGlkeW1pcw.._57-9pt}

The seminiferous tubules within each testis join to form the epididymis.
The **epididymis** (plural, epididymis) is a coiled tube about 6 meters
(20 feet) long lying atop the testis inside the scrotum. The functions
of the epididymis are to mature and store sperm until they leave the
body.

#### Ducts and Glands {#14.html#x-ck12-RHVjdHMgYW5kIEdsYW5kcw.._57-dcb}

In addition to these organs, the male reproductive system consists of a
series of ducts and glands. Ducts include the **vas deferens** and
ejaculatory ducts. They transport sperm from the epididymis to the
urethra in the penis. Glands include the **seminal vesicles** and
**prostate gland** . They secrete substances that become part of semen.

#### Semen {#14.html#x-ck12-U2VtZW4._57-2yr}

**Semen** is the fluid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of
the body. In addition to sperm, it contains secretions from the glands.
The secretions control pH and provide sperm with nutrients for energy.

**What's changes happen during puberty?**

A lot changes during this time. A boy has to start shaving, his voice
deepens, he gets taller, as well as a few other changes.

### Sexual Development in Males {#14.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsIERldmVsb3BtZW50IGluIE1hbGVz_58-ycf}

The only obvious difference between boys and girls at birth is their
reproductive organs. However, even the reproductive organs start out the
same in both sexes.

#### Development Before Birth {#14.html#x-ck12-RGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQgQmVmb3JlIEJpcnRo_58-tpq}

In the first several weeks after fertilization, males and females are
essentially the same except for their chromosomes. Females have two **X
chromosomes** (XX), and males have an X and a **Y chromosome** (XY).
Then, during the second month after fertilization, genes on the Y
chromosome of males cause the secretion of testosterone.
**Testosterone** stimulates the reproductive organs to develop into male
organs. (Without testosterone, the reproductive organs always develop
into female organs.) Although boys have male reproductive organs at
birth, the organs are immature and not yet able to produce sperm or
secrete testosterone.

#### Puberty and Its Changes {#14.html#x-ck12-UHViZXJ0eSBhbmQgSXRzIENoYW5nZXM._58-ams}

The reproductive organs grow very slowly during childhood and do not
mature until puberty. **Puberty** is the period during which humans
become sexually mature. In the U.S., boys generally begin puberty at
about age 12 and complete it at about age 18.

What causes puberty to begin? The hypothalamus in the brain “tells” the
pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the testes. The main
pituitary hormone involved is **luteinizing hormone (LH)** . It
stimulates the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone, in turn,
promotes protein synthesis and growth. It brings about most of the
physical changes of puberty, some of which are shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTAyLVN0YWdlcy1vZi1NYWxlLXB1YmVydHk.) .
In addition to the changes shown below, during puberty male facial hair
begins to grow, the shoulders broaden, and the male voice deepens. You
can watch an animation of these and other changes that occur in boys
during puberty at the *Interactive Body* link:
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/interactives/lifecycle/teenagers/]()

**Figure 14.97**

Some of the changes that occur in boys during puberty are shown in this
figure. Pubic hair grows, and the penis and testes both become larger.

</div>

#### Adolescent Growth Spurt {#14.html#x-ck12-QWRvbGVzY2VudCBHcm93dGggU3B1cnQ._58-f0p}

Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This
is called the **adolescent growth spurt** . In boys, it is controlled by
testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively
early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10
centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth
generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of
muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may
continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is
finished.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._58-vty}

-   The male reproductive system forms before birth but does not become
    capable of reproduction until it matures during puberty.
-   Puberty lasts from about ages 12 to 18 years and is controlled

**How many sperm does to take to fertilize an egg?**

85 million sperm per day are produced...per testicle. That's 170,000,000
every day. This means that a single male may produce more than a
quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000) sperm cells in his lifetime! But it only
takes one to fertilize an egg.

### Production and Delivery of Sperm {#14.html#x-ck12-UHJvZHVjdGlvbiBhbmQgRGVsaXZlcnkgb2YgU3Blcm0._59-u0p}

A sexually mature male produces an astounding number of **sperm**
—typically, hundreds of millions each day! Sperm production usually
continues uninterrupted until death, although the number and quality of
sperm decline during later adulthood.

#### Spermatogenesis {#14.html#x-ck12-U3Blcm1hdG9nZW5lc2lz_59-nkq}

The process of producing mature sperm is called **spermatogenesis** .
Sperm are produced in the **seminiferous tubules** of the testes and
become mature in the **epididymis** . The entire process takes about 9
to 10 weeks. You can watch an animation of spermatogenesis at this link:
[http://wps.aw.com/bc\_martini\_eap\_4/40/10469/2680298.cw/content/index.html](index.html)
.

If you look inside the seminiferous tubule shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTAzLXNlbWluaWZlcm91cy10dWJ1bGU.) , you
can see cells in various stages of spermatogenesis. The tubule is lined
with **spermatogonia** , which are diploid, sperm-producing cells.
Surrounding the spermatogonia are other cells. Some of these other cells
secrete substances to nourish sperm, and some secrete testosterone,
which is needed for sperm production.

Seminiferous Tubule. Cross section of a testis and seminiferous tubules.

</div>

Spermatogonia lining the seminiferous tubule undergo mitosis to form
**primary spermatocytes** , which are also diploid. The primary
spermatocytes undergo the first meiotic division to form **secondary
spermatocytes** , which are haploid. Spermatocytes make up the next
layer of cells inside the seminiferous tubule. Finally, the secondary
spermatocytes complete meiosis to form **spermatids** . Spermatids make
up a third layer of cells in the tubule.

#### Sperm Maturation {#14.html#x-ck12-U3Blcm0gTWF0dXJhdGlvbg.._59-ujj}

After spermatids form, they move into the epididymis to mature into
sperm, like the one shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA0LXNwZXJt) . The spermatids grow a
tail and lose excess cytoplasm from the head. When a sperm is mature,
the tail can rotate like a propeller, so the sperm can propel itself
forward. Mitochondria in the connecting piece produce the energy (ATP)
needed for movement. The head of the mature sperm consists mainly of the
nucleus, which carries copies of the father’s chromosomes. The part of
the head called the **acrosome** produces enzymes that help the sperm
head penetrate an egg.

#### Ejaculation {#14.html#x-ck12-RWphY3VsYXRpb24._59-dwk}

Sperm are released from the body during **ejaculation** . Ejaculation
occurs when muscle contractions propel sperm from the epididymis. The
sperm are forced through the ducts and out of the body through the
urethra. As sperm travel through the ducts, they mix with fluids from
the glands to form semen. Hundreds of millions of sperm are released
with each ejaculation.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._59-gwe}

-   Sperm are produced in the testes in the process of spermatogenesis.
-   Sperm mature in the epididymis before being ejaculated from the body
    through the penis.

**Think producing millions of sperm each day is complicated?**

If producing millions of sperm each day, as in the male reproductive
system, is complicated, that is nothing compared to what must occur in
the female reproductive system. This system is controlled by an
intricate dance of hormones, cycles, and events.

### Female Reproductive Structures {#14.html#x-ck12-RmVtYWxlIFJlcHJvZHVjdGl2ZSBTdHJ1Y3R1cmVz_60-h54}

The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce
female gametes called eggs and secrete the female sex hormone
**estrogen** . The female reproductive system has several other
functions as well:

1.  It receives sperm during sexual intercourse.
2.  It supports the development of a fetus.
3.  It delivers a baby during birth.
4.  It breast feeds a baby after birth.

The main structures of the female reproductive system are shown in
**Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA1LUZlbWFsZS1SZXByb2R1Y3RpdmUtc3RydWN0dXJl)
. Most of the structures are inside the pelvic region of the body.
Locate the structures in the figure as you read about them below. To

system](ck12_14_files/20150914105709107783.jpeg "Structures of the female reproductive system")

**Figure 14.100**

Female Reproductive Structures. Organs of the female reproductive system
include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.

</div>

#### External Structures {#14.html#x-ck12-RXh0ZXJuYWwgU3RydWN0dXJlcw.._60-2hf}

The external female reproductive structures are referred to collectively
as the **vulva** . They include the **labia** (singular, **labium** ),
which are the “lips” of the vulva. The labia protect the vagina and
urethra, both of which have openings in the vulva.

#### Vagina {#14.html#x-ck12-VmFnaW5h_60-0nl}

The **vagina** is a tube-like structure about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches)
long. It begins at the vulva and extends upward to the uterus. It has
muscular walls lined with mucous membranes. The vagina has two major
reproductive functions. It receives sperm during sexual intercourse, and
it provides a passageway for a baby to leave the mother’s body during
birth.

#### Uterus {#14.html#x-ck12-VXRlcnVz_60-sey}

The **uterus** is a muscular organ shaped like an upside-down pear. It
has a thick lining of tissues called the **endometrium** . The lower,
narrower end of the uterus is known as the **cervix** . The uterus is
where a fetus grows and develops until birth. During pregnancy, the
uterus can expand greatly to make room for the baby as it grows. During
birth, contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus push the baby
through the cervix and out of the body.

#### Ovaries {#14.html#x-ck12-T3Zhcmllcw.._60-l2u}

The two **ovaries** are small, egg-shaped organs that lie on either side
of the uterus. They produce eggs and secrete estrogen. Each egg is
located inside a structure called a **follicle** . Cells in the follicle
protect the egg and help it mature.

#### Fallopian Tubes {#14.html#x-ck12-RmFsbG9waWFuIFR1YmVz_60-mcy}

Extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two **fallopian
tubes** . Each tube reaches (but is not attached to) one of the ovaries.
The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure that moves in
waves. The motion sweeps eggs from the ovary into the tube.

#### Breasts {#14.html#x-ck12-QnJlYXN0cw.._60-oof}

The **breasts** are not directly involved in reproduction, but they
nourish a baby after birth. Each breast contains **mammary glands** ,
which secrete milk. The milk drains into ducts leading to the nipple. A
suckling baby squeezes the milk out of the ducts and through the nipple.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._60-9eu}

-   The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce
    eggs and secrete female sex hormones. They also provide a site for
    fertilization and enable the development and birth of a fetus.
-   Female reproductive structures include the vagina, uterus, ovaries,
    and fallopian tubes.

**What changes happen during puberty?**

A lot changes during this time. Girls may become interested in many new
things, including the art of makeup.

### Sexual Development in Females {#14.html#x-ck12-U2V4dWFsIERldmVsb3BtZW50IGluIEZlbWFsZXM._61-hzd}

Female reproductive organs form before birth. However, as in males, the
organs do not mature until puberty.

#### Development Before Birth {#14.html#x-ck12-RGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQgQmVmb3JlIEJpcnRo_61-mh3}

Unlike males, females are not influenced by the male sex hormone
testosterone during embryonic development. This is because they lack a Y
chromosome. As a result, females do not develop male reproductive
organs. By the third month of fetal development, most of the internal
female organs have formed. Immature eggs also form in the ovary before
birth. Whereas a mature male produces sperm throughout his life, a
female produces all the eggs she will ever make before birth.

#### Changes of Puberty {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2hhbmdlcyBvZiBQdWJlcnR5_61-g2o}

Like baby boys, baby girls are born with all their reproductive organs
present but immature and unable to function. Female reproductive organs
also grow very little until puberty. Girls begin puberty a year or two
earlier than boys, at an average age of 10 years. Girls also complete
puberty sooner than boys, in about 4 years instead of 6.

Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus “tells” the pituitary
gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries. Two pituitary
hormones are involved: **luteinizing hormone (LH)** and
**follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)** . These hormones stimulate the
ovary to produce **estrogen** . Estrogen, in turn, promotes growth and
other physical changes of puberty. It stimulates growth and development
of the internal reproductive organs, breasts, and pubic hair (see
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA2LUZlbWFsZS1QdWJlcnR5) ).
You can watch an animation of these and other changes that girls
experience during puberty at this link:

puberty](ck12_14_files/20150914105709625320.png "Changes in females during puberty")

**Figure 14.101**

Changes in Females During Puberty. Two obvious changes of puberty in
girls are growth and development of the breasts and pubic hair. The
stages begin around age 10 and are completed by about age 14.

</div>

#### Adolescent Growth Spurt {#14.html#x-ck12-QWRvbGVzY2VudCBHcm93dGggU3B1cnQ._61-0jp}

Like boys, girls also go through an **adolescent growth spurt** .
However, girls typically start their growth spurt a year or two earlier
than boys (and therefore a couple of centimeters shorter, on average).
Girls also have a shorter growth spurt. For example, they typically
reach their adult height by about age 15. In addition, girls generally
do not grow as fast as boys do during the growth spurt, even at their
peak rate of growth. As a result, females are about 10 centimeters
(about 4 inches) shorter, on average, than males by the time they reach
their final height.

#### Menarche {#14.html#x-ck12-TWVuYXJjaGU._61-wk2}

One of the most significant changes in females during puberty is
menarche. **Menarche** is the beginning of **menstruation** , or monthly
periods as the ovaries begin the cyclic release of an egg. In U.S.
girls, the average age of menarche is 12.5 years, although there is a
lot of variation in this age. The variation may be due to a combination
of genetic factors and environmental factors, such as diet.

**What's amazing about these cells?**

Many things. A human egg cell. Just add sperm and you have the necessary
ingredients for a new baby. What's amazing about these cells is that
they are all produced before the girl is even born. Before the girl is
even born, plans for the next generation have begun. And that is the
start of an amazing process.

### Egg Production {#14.html#x-ck12-RWdnIFByb2R1Y3Rpb24._62-hxw}

At birth, a female’s ovaries contain all the eggs she will ever produce.
However, the eggs do not start to mature until she enters puberty. After
menarche, one egg typically matures each month until a woman reaches
middle adulthood.

#### Oogenesis {#14.html#x-ck12-T29nZW5lc2lz_62-hzn}

The process of producing eggs in the ovary is called **oogenesis** .
Eggs, like sperm, are haploid cells, and their production occurs in
several steps that involve different types of cells, as shown in
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA3LU9vZ2VuZXNpcw..) . You
can follow the process of oogenesis in the figure as you read about it
below.

**Figure 14.102**

Oogenesis. Oogenesis begins before birth but is not finished until after
puberty. A mature egg forms only if a secondary oocyte is fertilized by
a sperm.

</div>

Oogenesis begins long before birth when an **oogonium** with the diploid
number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis. It produces a diploid daughter
cell called a **primary oocyte** . The primary oocyte, in turn, starts
to go through the first cell division of meiosis (meiosis I). However,
it does not complete meiosis until much later. The primary oocyte
remains in a resting state, nestled in a tiny, immature **follicle**
until puberty.

#### Maturation of a Follicle {#14.html#x-ck12-TWF0dXJhdGlvbiBvZiBhIEZvbGxpY2xl_62-1f2}

Beginning in puberty, each month one of the follicles and its primary
oocyte starts to mature (also see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA4LWZvbGxpY2xlLW92dWxhdGlvbg..) ). The
primary oocyte resumes meiosis and divides to form a **secondary
oocyte** and a smaller cell, called a **polar body** . Both the
secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid cells. The secondary oocyte
has most of the cytoplasm from the original cell and is much larger than
the polar body.

**Figure 14.103**

Maturation of a Follicle and Ovulation. A follicle matures and its
primary oocyte (follicle) resumes meiosis to form a secondary oocyte in
the secondary follicle. The follicle ruptures and the oocyte leaves the
ovary during ovulation. What happens to the ruptured follicle then?

</div>

#### Ovulation and Fertilization {#14.html#x-ck12-T3Z1bGF0aW9uIGFuZCBGZXJ0aWxpemF0aW9u_62-7kt}

After 12–14 days, when the follicle is mature, it bursts open, releasing
the secondary oocyte from the ovary. This event is called **ovulation**
(see **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA4LWZvbGxpY2xlLW92dWxhdGlvbg..) ). The
follicle, now called a **corpus luteum** , starts to degenerate, or
break down. After the secondary oocyte leaves the ovary, it is swept
into the nearby fallopian tube by the waving, fringelike end (see
**Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTA5LWVnZy1mYWxsb3BpYW4tdHViZQ..) ).

Egg Entering Fallopian Tube. After ovulation, the fringelike end of the

</div>

If the secondary oocyte is fertilized by a sperm as it is passing
through the fallopian tube, it completes meiosis and forms a mature egg
and another polar body. (The polar bodies break down and disappear.) If
the secondary oocyte is not fertilized, it passes into the uterus as an
immature egg and soon disintegrates. You can watch an animation of all
these events and the hormones that control them at the link below.

**What's the most important part of the female menstrual cycle?**

A menstrual cycle calendar. A lot of things to keep track of. And for a
few very important reasons, it is important to know when a woman is
ovulating. But what's the most important part of the female menstrual
cycle? That depends on who you ask.

### Menstrual Cycle {#14.html#x-ck12-TWVuc3RydWFsIEN5Y2xl_63-oys}

**Ovulation** , the release of an egg from an ovary, is part of the
**menstrual cycle** , which typically occurs each month in a sexually
mature female unless she is pregnant. Another part of the cycle is the
monthly period, or menstruation. **Menstruation** is the process in
which the **endometrium** of the uterus is shed from the body. The
menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones from the hypothalamus,
pituitary gland, and ovaries. For an interactive animation of the
menstrual cycle, you can go this link:
[http://health.howstuffworks.com/adam-200132.htm](adam-200132.htm)

#### Phases of the Menstrual Cycle {#14.html#x-ck12-UGhhc2VzIG9mIHRoZSBNZW5zdHJ1YWwgQ3ljbGU._63-ajb}

As shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTEwLU1lbnN0cnVhbC1DeWNsZQ..) , the
menstrual cycle occurs in several phases. The cycle begins with
menstruation. During menstruation, arteries that supply the endometrium
of the uterus constrict. As a result, the endometrium breaks down and
detaches from the uterus. It passes out of the body through the vagina
over a period of several days.

**Figure 14.105**

Phases of the Menstrual Cycle. The menstrual cycle occurs in the phases
shown here.

</div>

After menstruation, the endometrium begins to build up again. At the
same time, a **follicle** starts maturing in an ovary. Ovulation occurs
around day 14 of the cycle. After it occurs, the endometrium continues
to build up in preparation for a fertilized egg. What happens next
depends on whether the egg is fertilized.

If the egg is fertilized, the endometrium will be maintained and help
nourish the egg. The ruptured follicle, now called the **corpus luteum**
, will secrete the hormone **progesterone** . This hormone keeps the
endometrium from breaking down. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus
luteum will break down and disappear. Without progesterone, the
endometrium will also break down and be shed. A new menstrual cycle thus
begins.

#### Menopause {#14.html#x-ck12-TWVub3BhdXNl_63-u6j}

For most women, menstrual cycles continue until their mid- or late-
forties. Then women go through **menopause** , a period during which
their menstrual cycles slow down and eventually stop, generally by their
early fifties. After menopause, women can no longer reproduce naturally
because their ovaries no longer produce eggs.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._63-9sg}

-   The menstrual cycle includes events that take place in the ovary,
    such as ovulation.
-   The menstrual cycle also includes changes in the uterus,
    including menstruation.
-   Menopause occurs when menstruation stops occurring, usually in
    middle adulthood.

**How far does a sperm have to swim?**

Sperm swimming to an egg. If fertilization occurs, the egg will have all
the "instructions" to grow into a new organism. That one cell will
become two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, and on and on and on.
And after about 9 months, that one cell will have become a new baby. But
it all starts with the sperm swimming to the egg. A sperm cell is about
two thousandths of an inch long. And although they are small, they can
swim roughly 8 inches in an hour. To reach an egg, they will ultimately
they have to swim around 192,000 times their own length.

### Cleavage and Implantation {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2xlYXZhZ2UgYW5kIEltcGxhbnRhdGlvbg.._64-yu4}

A day or two after an ovary releases an egg, the egg may unite with a
sperm. Sperm are deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse. They
propel themselves through the **uterus** and enter a **fallopian tube**
. This is where **fertilization** usually takes place.

When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers the egg to complete
meiosis. The sperm also undergoes changes. Its tail falls off, and its
nucleus fuses with the nucleus of the egg. The resulting cell, called a
**zygote** , contains all the chromosomes needed for a new human
organism. Half the chromosomes come from the egg and half from the
sperm.

#### Morula and Blastocyst Stages {#14.html#x-ck12-TW9ydWxhIGFuZCBCbGFzdG9jeXN0IFN0YWdlcw.._64-chg}

The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube
toward the uterus, where it will take up residence. As it travels, it
divides by mitosis several times to form a ball of cells called a
**morula** . The cell divisions are called **cleavage** . They increase
the number of cells but not the overall size of the new organism. As
more cell divisions occur, a fluid-filled cavity forms inside the ball
of cells. At this stage, the ball of cells is called a **blastocyst** .

The cells of the blastocyst form an inner cell mass and an outer cell
layer, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTExLWJsYXN0b2N5c3Q.) . The inner cell
mass is called the **embryoblast** . These cells will soon develop into
an embryo. The outer cell layer is called the **trophoblast** . These
cells will develop into other structures needed to support and nourish
the embryo.

Blastocyst. The blastocyst consists of an outer layer of cells called
the trophoblast and an inner cell mass called the embryoblast. The
blastocyst fluid-filled cavity is also known as the blastocoel or
blastocoele.

</div>

#### Implantation {#14.html#x-ck12-SW1wbGFudGF0aW9u_64-sj9}

The blastocyst continues down the fallopian tube and reaches the uterus
about 4 or 5 days after fertilization. When the outer cells of the
blastocyst contact cells of the endometrium lining the uterus, the
blastocyst embeds in the endometrium. The process of embedding is called
**implantation** . It generally occurs about a week after fertilization.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._64-8zo}

-   Fertilization is the union of a sperm and egg, resulting in the
    formation of a zygote.
-   The zygote undergoes many cell divisions before it implants in the
    lining of the uterus.

**At one time, did we all really look alike?**

We all start as a single cell and soon grow into an embryo. Notice the
remarkable details beginning to form. The eyes, backbone, and limb buds
are obvious. Think about the amazing complexity that must be going on
inside the embryo, and the tremendous amount of growth and development
still to come. So, yes, at one time we all looked similar.

### Growth and Development of the Embryo {#14.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBEZXZlbG9wbWVudCBvZiB0aGUgRW1icnlv_65-xls}

After implantation occurs, the **blastocyst** is called an **embryo** .
The embryonic stage lasts through the eighth week following
fertilization. During this time, the embryo grows in size and becomes
more complex. It develops specialized cells and tissues and starts to
form most organs. For an interactive animation of embryonic development,
go to this link:
[http://health.howstuffworks.com/adam-200129.htm](adam-200129.htm) .

#### Formation of Cell Layers {#14.html#x-ck12-Rm9ybWF0aW9uIG9mIENlbGwgTGF5ZXJz_65-7pr}

During the second week after fertilization, cells in the embryo migrate
to form three distinct cell layers, called the **ectoderm, mesoderm** ,
and **endoderm** . Each layer will soon develop into different types of
cells and tissues, as shown in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTEyLUVtYnJ5by1jZWxsLWxheWVycw..) .

</div>

#### Differentiation of Cells {#14.html#x-ck12-RGlmZmVyZW50aWF0aW9uIG9mIENlbGxz_65-jps}

A **zygote** is a single cell. How does a single cell develop into many
different types of cells? During the third week after fertilization, the
embryo begins to undergo cellular differentiation. **Differentiation**
is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized. As
illustrated in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTEzLVN0ZW1fY2VsbHM.) , differentiation
occurs as certain genes are expressed ("switched on") while other genes
are switched off. Because of this process, cells develop unique
structures and abilities that suit them for their specialized functions.
You can explore cell differentiation by watching the video at this link:

#### Organ Formation {#14.html#x-ck12-T3JnYW4gRm9ybWF0aW9u_65-1ye}

After cells differentiate, all the major organs begin to form during the
remaining weeks of embryonic development. A few of the developments that
occur in the embryo during weeks 4 through 8 are listed in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTE0LUVtYnJ5by1kdXJpbmctZmlyc3QtNC13ZWVrcw..)
. As the embryo develops, it also grows in size. By the eighth week of
development, the embryo is about 30 millimeters (just over 1 inch) in
length. It may also have begun to move.

**What characterizes this fetus as human?**

The human fetus. Notice the details in the face and hands. Compare this
to the human embryo, and the amount of growth and development is truly
remarkable.

### Growth and Development of the Fetus {#14.html#x-ck12-R3Jvd3RoIGFuZCBEZXZlbG9wbWVudCBvZiB0aGUgRmV0dXM._66-khv}

From the end of the eighth week until birth, the developing human
organism is referred to as a **fetus** . Birth typically occurs at about
38 weeks after fertilization, so the fetal period generally lasts about
30 weeks. During this time, as outlined in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTE1LUZldHVzLTE4LXdlZWtz) , the organs
complete their development. The fetus also grows rapidly in length and
weight.

**How does a developing baby breathe?**

Or eat? From mom of course. Shown is a detailed representation of the
placenta. And this is where all these interactions occur.

### Placenta and Related Structures {#14.html#x-ck12-UGxhY2VudGEgYW5kIFJlbGF0ZWQgU3RydWN0dXJlcw.._67-myf}

The fetus could not grow and develop without oxygen and nutrients from
the mother. Wastes from the fetus must also be removed in order for it
to survive. The exchange of these substances between the mother and
fetus occurs through the placenta.

#### Placenta {#14.html#x-ck12-UGxhY2VudGE._67-yme}

The **placenta** is a temporary organ that begins to form from the
**trophoblast** layer of cells shortly after **implantation** . The
placenta continues to develop and grow to meet the needs of the growing
fetus. A fully developed placenta is made up of a large mass of blood
vessels from both the mother and fetus. The maternal and fetal vessels
are close together but separated by tiny spaces. This allows the
mother’s and fetus’s blood to exchange substances across their capillary
walls without the blood actually mixing. See *The Placenta and the
Fetus: Structure and Function* at
[http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/the-placenta-and-the-fetus-structure-and-function.html](the-placenta-and-the-fetus-structure-and-function.html)
for additional information.

The fetus is connected to the placenta through the **umbilical cord** ,
a tube that contains two arteries and a vein. Blood from the fetus
enters the placenta through the umbilical arteries, exchanges gases and
other substances with the mother’s blood, and travels back to the fetus
through the umbilical vein.

#### Amniotic Sac and Fluid {#14.html#x-ck12-QW1uaW90aWMgU2FjIGFuZCBGbHVpZA.._67-kug}

Attached to the placenta is the **amniotic sac** , an enclosed membrane
that surrounds and protects the fetus. It contains **amniotic fluid** ,
which consists of water and dissolved substances. The fluid allows the
fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space.
The fluid also cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._67-qfo}

-   The placenta allows nutrients and wastes to be exchanged between the
    mother and fetus.

**Why is it called labor?**

So…the mother carries the developing baby for nine months. We know about
the tremendous growth and development of the embryo and fetus. Then
comes labor.

### Pregnancy and Childbirth {#14.html#x-ck12-UHJlZ25hbmN5IGFuZCBDaGlsZGJpcnRo_68-s5g}

**Pregnancy** is the carrying of one or more offspring from
fertilization until birth. It is the development of an embryo and fetus
from the expectant mother’s point of view.

#### The Mother’s Role {#14.html#x-ck12-VGhlIE1vdGhlcuKAmXMgUm9sZQ.._68-kom}

The pregnant mother plays a critical role in the development of the
embryo and fetus. She must avoid toxic substances such as alcohol, which
can damage the developing offspring. She must also provide all the
nutrients and other substances needed for normal growth and development.
Most nutrients are needed in greater amounts by a pregnant woman, but
some are especially important, including **folic acid** (vitamin B ~9~
), calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.

#### Childbirth {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2hpbGRiaXJ0aA.._68-pxd}

Near the time of birth, the **amniotic sac** breaks in a gush of fluid.
Often when this occurs, women say that their "water broke." **Labor**
usually begins within a day of this event. Labor involves
**contractions** of the muscular walls of the uterus, which cause the
**cervix** to dilate. With the mother’s help, the contractions
eventually push the fetus out of the uterus and through the vagina.
Within seconds of birth, the **umbilical cord** is cut. Without this
connection to the placenta, the baby cannot exchange gases, so carbon
dioxide quickly builds up in the baby’s blood. This stimulates the brain
to trigger breathing, and the newborn takes its first breath. See *Labor
and Birth - BabyCenter Video* at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgZ5z6RB06c](watch?v=BgZ5z6RB06c) for

**What's the main difference between an adorable little baby and a
teenager?**

This quiet little baby will soon grow into someone who talks and
expresses feelings and attitudes. What's the main difference between an
adorable little baby and a teenager? Plenty.

### From Birth to Adulthood {#14.html#x-ck12-RnJvbSBCaXJ0aCB0byBBZHVsdGhvb2Q._69-bdy}

For the first year after birth, a baby is called an **infant** .
**Childhood** begins at age two and continues until adolescence.
**Adolescence** is the last stage of life before adulthood.

#### Infancy {#14.html#x-ck12-SW5mYW5jeQ.._69-cre}

**Infancy** is the first year of life after birth. Infants are born with
a surprising range of abilities. For example, they have well-developed
senses of touch, hearing, and smell. They can also communicate their
needs by crying. During their first year, they develop many other
abilities, including those described below. For a video of major
milestones in the first year of life, go to this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5\_Ao\_3hTS6I](watch?v=5_Ao_3hTS6I) .

By 6 weeks after birth, infants typically start smiling (see **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTE3LWluZmFudC02LXdlZWtz) ) and making
vocal sounds. By 6 months, infants are babbling. They have also learned
to sit and are starting to crawl. The **deciduous teeth** (baby teeth)
have started to come in. By 12 months, infants may be saying their first
words. They usually can stand with help and may even have started to
walk.

**Figure 14.114**

A baby’s first smile is an early milestone in infant development.

</div>

Infancy is the period of most rapid growth after birth. Growth is even
faster during infancy that it is during puberty. By the end of the first
year, the average baby is twice as long as it was at birth and three
times as heavy.

#### Childhood {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2hpbGRob29k_69-9wn}

A **toddler** is a child aged 1 to 3 years. Children of this age are
learning to walk, or “toddle.” Growth is still relatively rapid during
the toddler years but it has begun to slow down. During the next three
years, children achieve many more milestones.

-   By age 4, most children can run, climb stairs, and scribble with
    a crayon. They know many words and use simple sentences. The
    majority are also toilet trained.
-   By age five, children are able to carry on conversations, recognize
    letters and words, and use a pencil to trace letters. They can
    usually tie their own shoelaces and may be learning to ride a
    bicycle, swing a bat, kick a ball and play other games ( **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-Rml2ZV95ZWFyX29sZF9naXJs) ).
-   By age 6, most children begin losing their deciduous teeth, and
    their permanent teeth start coming in. They speak fluently and are
    learning to read and write. They spend more time with peers and
    develop friendships.

Five year olds can usually play various games.

</div>

Older children continue to grow slowly until they start the adolescent
growth spurt during puberty. They also continue to develop mentally,
emotionally, and socially. Think about all the ways you have changed
since you were as young as the child in **Figure**
[above](#14.html#x-ck12-Rml2ZV95ZWFyX29sZF9naXJs) . What milestones of
development did you achieve during these childhood years?

#### Puberty {#14.html#x-ck12-QWRvbGVzY2VuY2U._69-m4l}

Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature.
Puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the testes to secrete
testosterone in boys, and in girls the pituitary gland signals the
ovaries to secrete estrogen. Changes that occur during puberty are
discussed in the *Male Reproductive Development* and *Female
Reproductive Development* concepts.

#### Adolescence

Adolescence is the period of transition between the beginning of puberty
and adulthood. Adolescence is also a time of significant mental,
emotional, and social changes. For example:

-   Adolescents generally develop the ability to think abstractly.
-   Adolescents may have mood swings because of surging **hormones** .
-   Adolescents usually try to be more independent from their parents.
-   Adolescents typically spend much of their time with peers.
-   Adolescents may start to develop intimate relationships.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._69-ren}

-   Growth and development are most rapid during infancy and slower
    throughout the rest of childhood until adolescence.
-   Adolescence involves mental, emotional, and social changes in
    addition to the physical changes of puberty.

**Does getting older have to be a bad thing?**

Being older doesn't necessarily mean being unable to do things and not
enjoy life. These seniors look as if they thoroughly enjoy life. And
some would say that life begins after all the children have moved out of
the house.

### Adulthood and Aging {#14.html#x-ck12-QWR1bHRob29kIGFuZCBBZ2luZw.._70-rzw}

**Adulthood** does not have a definite starting point. A person may be
physically mature by age 16 or 17 but not defined as an adult by law
until older ages. In the U.S., you can’t join the armed forces or vote
until age 18. You can’t buy or use alcohol or take on many legal and
financial responsibilities until age 21.

*21 Years* at
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-4i2ZlqLsI](watch?v=d-4i2ZlqLsI) is a
daily video pictorial of the aging process, from birth to 21 years. Over
7,500 images of the same person have been condensed in a little over 6
minutes.

#### Early Adulthood {#14.html#x-ck12-RWFybHkgQWR1bHRob29k_70-1o6}

**Early adulthood** coincides with the 20s and early 30s. During early
adulthood, people generally form intimate relationships, both in
friendship and love. Many people become engaged or marry during this
time. Often they are completing their education and becoming established
in a career. Health problems in young adults tend to be minor. The most
common causes of death are homicides, car crashes, and suicides.

#### Middle Adulthood {#14.html#x-ck12-TWlkZGxlIEFkdWx0aG9vZA.._70-ju7}

**Middle adulthood** lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this
stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career
goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and
gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start
declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart
disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These
diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood.

##### Heart Disease {#14.html#x-ck12-SGVhcnQgRGlzZWFzZQ.._70-2kq}

Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans, and one of the main
killers of people the world over. A common cause of heart disease is
arteriosclerosis. This is the stiffening or hardening of the arteries
that happens, in part, because of growing older. Atherosclerosis, which
is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, is another cause of
cardiovascular disease. When fat accumulates along the walls of
arteries, there is less space for blood to flow. This makes it harder
for blood to get to all the parts of the body that need it, including
the heart itself. The accumulation of fatty deposits, or plaque, can
eventually lead to a heart attack or stroke.

Other changes to the heart occur during middle adulthood. For example,
to help the heart pump blood through stiffer blood vessels, some parts
of the heart wall thicken. The size of the four chambers of the heart
also change, as do the valves between the chambers. The resting heart
rate does not change as you age, but the heart cannot beat as fast when
you are physically active or stressed, as it did when you were younger.

Both genetic and lifestyle choices lead to heart disease. Though you
cannot change your genetic background, there are things you can do to
slow or prevent the onset of heart disease, especially as you grow
older.

-   try to be more physically active,
-   if you smoke, quit,
-   follow a heart healthy diet,
-   keep a healthy weight.

#### Old Age {#14.html#x-ck12-T2xkIEFnZQ.._70-vwa}

**Old age** begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many
people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for
hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex
time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain
cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient,
increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia.
Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function
also become more common.

#### Causes of Aging {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2F1c2VzIG9mIEFnaW5n_70-iub}

Why do we decline in all these ways as we age? Generally, it’s because
cells stop dividing and die. There are at least two reasons why cells
stop dividing:

1.  Cells are programmed to divide only a set number of times.
2.  Mutations accumulate in DNA, and cells with damaged DNA may
    not divide.

For additional information of aging, see the National Institute of Aging
site at [http://www.nia.nih.gov](www.nia.nih.gov) .

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._70-fdm}

-   During early adulthood, people form intimate relationships and
    start careers.
-   Serious health problems start showing up in middle adulthood and

**What does “safe Sex” truly mean?**

“Safe Sex.” The thought of a sexually transmitted infection should be
enough to make you think about and believe in this saying.

### Understanding Sexually Transmitted Infections {#14.html#x-ck12-VW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZyBTZXh1YWxseSBUcmFuc21pdHRlZCBJbmZlY3Rpb25z_71-3rb}

A shocking statistic made headlines in 2008. A recent study had found
that one in four teen girls in the U.S. had a sexually transmitted
infection. A **sexually transmitted infection (STI)** (also known as a
**sexually transmitted disease** , or STD) is an infection caused by a
pathogen that spreads mainly through sexual contact. Worldwide, a
million people a day become infected with STIs. The majority of them are
under the age of 25.

For a video about sexually transmitted infections, go to this link:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bazh6p5rOFM](watch?v=Bazh6p5rOFM) .

[![](ck12_14_files/tmpMIBtvi.jpeg)](Bazh6p5rOFM)

Click on the image above for more content

To be considered an STI, an infection must have only a small chance of
spreading naturally in ways other than sexual contact. Some infections
that can spread through sexual contact, such as the common cold, spread
more commonly by other means. These infections are not considered STIs.

#### Pathogens that Cause STIs {#14.html#x-ck12-UGF0aG9nZW5zIHRoYXQgQ2F1c2UgU1RJcw.._71-sua}

STIs may be caused by several different types of pathogens, including
protozoa, insects, bacteria, and viruses. For example:

-   Protozoa cause an STI called **trichomoniasis** . The pathogen
    infects the vagina in females and the urethra in males, causing
    symptoms such as burning and itching. Trichomoniasis is common in
    young people.
-   **Pubic lice** , like the one in **Figure**
    [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTE5LXB1YmljLWxvdXNl) , are insect
    parasites that are transmitted sexually. They suck the blood of
    their host and irritate the skin in the pubic area.

</div>

Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses. Bacterial STIs can be cured
with antibiotics. Viral STIs cannot be cured. Once you are infected with
a viral STI, you are likely to be infected for life.

#### How STIs Spread {#14.html#x-ck12-SG93IFNUSXMgU3ByZWFk_71-gpl}

Most of the pathogens that cause STIs enter the body through **mucous
membranes** of the reproductive organs. All sexual behaviors that
involve contact between mucous membranes put a person at risk for
infection. This includes vaginal, anal, and oral sexual behaviors. Many
STIs can also be transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen,
and breast milk. Therefore, behaviors such as sharing injection or
tattoo needles is another way these STIs can spread.

Why are STIs common in young people? One reason is that young people
often take risks. They may think, “It can’t happen to me.” They also may
not know how STIs are spread, so they don’t know how to protect
themselves. In addition, young people may have multiple sexual partners.

#### Preventing STIs {#14.html#x-ck12-UHJldmVudGluZyBTVElz_71-gyw}

The only completely effective way to prevent infection with STIs is to
avoid sexual contact and other risky behaviors. Using condoms can lower
the risk of becoming infected with STIs during some types of sexual
activity. However, condoms are not foolproof. Pathogens may be present
on areas of the body not covered by condoms. Condoms can also break or
be used incorrectly.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._71-7zc}

-   STIs are diseases caused by pathogens that spread through
    sexual contact.
-   Abstinence from sexual activity and other risk behaviors is the only
    completely effective way to prevent the spread of STIs.

**Single-celled organisms. Can they be dangerous?**

These are chlamydia. Innocent-looking single-celled organisms. But these
bacteria can lead to painful and devastating consequences.

### Bacterial STIs {#14.html#x-ck12-QmFjdGVyaWFsIFNUSXM._72-yfs}

Many STIs are caused by bacteria. Some of the most common bacterial STIs
are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Bacterial STIs can be cured with
antibiotics.

#### Chlamydia {#14.html#x-ck12-Q2hsYW15ZGlh_72-bok}

**Chlamydia** is the most common STI in the United States. As shown in
the graph in **Figure**
[below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTIwLWNobGFteWRpYS1ncmFwaA..) , females
are much more likely than males to develop chlamydia. Like most STIs,
rates of chlamydia are highest in teens and young adults.

Symptoms of chlamydia may include a burning sensation during urination
and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Chlamydia can be cured with
**antibiotics** , but often there are no symptoms, so people do not seek
treatment. Untreated chlamydia can lead to more serious problems, such
as **pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** . This is an infection of the
uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries. It can scar a woman’s
reproductive organs and make it difficult for her to become pregnant.

#### Gonorrhea {#14.html#x-ck12-R29ub3JyaGVh_72-exr}

**Gonorrhea** is another common STI. Symptoms of gonorrhea may include
painful urination and discharge from the vagina or penis. Gonorrhea
usually can be cured with antibiotics, although the bacteria have
developed resistance to many of the drugs. Gonorrhea infections may not
cause symptoms, especially in females, so they often go untreated.
Untreated gonorrhea can lead to PID in females. It can lead to
inflammation of the reproductive organs in males as well.

#### Syphilis {#14.html#x-ck12-U3lwaGlsaXM._72-asv}

**Syphilis** is less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea but more serious
if untreated. Early symptoms of syphilis infection include a small sore
on or near the genitals. The sore is painless and heals on its own, so
it may go unnoticed. If treated early, most cases of syphilis can be
cured with antibiotics. Untreated syphilis can cause serious damage to
the heart, brain, and other organs. It may eventually lead to death.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._72-eqz}

-   Bacterial STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
-   Bacterial STIs usually can be cured with antibiotics.

**How long does a viral STI last?**

This is the Human Papilloma Virus, which causes a viral STI. Viral STIs
can be especially dangerous, as they cannot be cured. Once you get one,
it's yours for life. And also, it's the person's you give it to.

### Viral STIs {#14.html#x-ck12-VmlyYWwgU1RJcw.._73-hue}

STIs caused by viruses include genital herpes, hepatitis B, genital
warts, and **HIV/AIDS** . Whereas bacterial STIs can usually be cured
with antibiotics, viral STIs cannot be cured.

#### Genital Herpes {#14.html#x-ck12-R2VuaXRhbCBIZXJwZXM._73-uo6}

**Genital herpes** is an STI caused by a herpes virus. In the United
States, as many as one in four people are infected with the virus.
Symptoms of genital herpes include painful blisters on the genitals (see
**Figure** [below](#14.html#x-ck12-QmlvLTI1LTIxLWhlcnBlcy1ibGlzdGVycw..)
). The blisters usually go away on their own, but the virus remains in
the body, causing periodic outbreaks of blisters throughout life.
Outbreaks may be triggered by stress, illness, or other factors. A
person with genital herpes is most likely to transmit the virus during
an outbreak.

**Figure 14.118**

Blisters like these on the genitals are a sign of genital herpes.

</div>

#### Hepatitis B {#14.html#x-ck12-SGVwYXRpdGlzIEI._73-am9}

**Hepatitis B** is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with
the hepatitis B virus. In many people, the immune system quickly
eliminates the virus from the body. However, in a small percentage of
people, the virus remains in the body and continues to cause illness. It
may eventually damage the liver and increase the risk of liver cancer,
which is usually fatal.

#### Genital Warts and Cervical Cancer {#14.html#x-ck12-R2VuaXRhbCBXYXJ0cyBhbmQgQ2VydmljYWwgQ2FuY2Vy_73-xgz}

Infections with the **human papillomavirus (HPV)** are very common. HPV
may cause **genital warts** , which are small, rough growths on the
genitals. It may also cause cancer of the cervix in females. A simple
test, called a **Pap test** , can detect **cervical cancer** . If the
cancer is detected early, it usually can be cured with surgery. There is
also a vaccine , GARDASIL, to prevent infection with HPV. The vaccine is
recommended for females aged 11 to 26 years.

### Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ.._73-jvq}

-   Viral STIs include genital herpes, hepatitis B, genital warts, and
    cervical cancer.
-   Viral STIs cannot be cured, but some of them can be prevented
    with vaccines.

## Summary {#14.html#x-ck12-U3VtbWFyeQ..-e6d}

The human body. Made of numerous organ systems. Maybe one of the most
complex structures ever. But all these systems and structures come
together in an exquisite manner to make a fascinating organism.
Currently, the end of the line of evolution. The most intelligent of all
organisms. An organism that can protect itself from pathogens, has bones
for support, muscles to help it move, systems that allow it to respond
to the environment, systems to bring oxygen into and around the body,
systems to extract nutrients from food and get rid of wastes, and
systems to make the next generation. And all these systems and organs
and tissues and cells work together to form one complete organism.
